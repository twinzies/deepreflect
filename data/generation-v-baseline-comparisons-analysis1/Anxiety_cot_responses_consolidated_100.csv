mrovy7,Anxiety,I feel like I’m not mentally equipped to handle adulthood or life in general.,meadowpunk,"Everything is stressful and anxiety-inducing. Every. Thing. I barely leave my apartment anymore. My car needs an oil change that I’m too scared to go get done. I don’t make or answer phone calls. I have zero friends. I don’t. Do. Anything. I literally just sit at home watching Netflix to pass time. I lost my job last year and was on unemployment for awhile. Now I’m thirty pounds fatter and am rapidly running out of money because I waste it all on junk food because that’s the only source of comfort I have. Now I’m job searching but I’m too scared to do interviews and even if I did get one I know I have to go out and buy all new clothes and the idea of doing that just makes me want to die. 

Just. Every aspect of life is so hard and embarrassing and stressful. I never feel happy or content. Even shut up in my apartment I’m just thinking about how pathetic I am and how I’m wasting my life but I can’t change it. People always say to get therapy but how am I supposed to do that when I can’t even make a phone call or walk out my front door? How am I supposed to sit in a room with someone and be the center of attention and talk about my deepest thoughts and feelings?

Baby steps! My only ""hack"" is to go ""AhHHH"" and just do stuff (even easy stuff) to bypass my brain",2,MintyLotus,"I hear you, and it sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck right now. It’s understandable that everything feels daunting when you're in this place. It's important to acknowledge that you’ve taken a significant step by expressing how you feel, even if it’s just writing it out. That takes courage.

The cycle of anxiety and avoidance can be incredibly tough, and it's okay to start small. Consider focusing on one small, manageable step at a time. Maybe it's setting a goal to get outside for just a few minutes each day or reaching out to a mental health professional through online platforms where you can chat or email instead of making a phone call.

You're not alone in feeling this way, and many people have found a path forward, even when it seemed impossible. It might help to explore online communities or resources where you can connect with others who understand what you’re going through. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and taking that first step, no matter how small, is a victory in itself.","

Your response:
","I hear how overwhelming and paralyzing everything feels right now. It's like you're caught in a cycle where anxiety prevents you from getting help for the anxiety itself, and I can sense how frustrating and isolating that must be. The way you described even simple tasks feeling monumentally difficult really shows how much you're struggling.

It's important you reached out here - that took courage, even if it doesn't feel that way. While I understand traditional therapy feels impossible right now, there are actually online and text-based counseling services that let you start getting support without having to leave your apartment or make phone calls. Would something like that feel more manageable as a first step?

You're not pathetic - you're someone dealing with very real anxiety that's making daily life extremely challenging. The fact that you're aware of these challenges and expressing a desire for change, even while feeling stuck, shows there's a part of you that wants to move forward. That's something we can work with.","

","I can sense the overwhelming weight of anxiety and stress that's holding you back from living the life you want. It's like everything feels too much to handle, and it's easier to retreat to the comfort of your apartment and Netflix. I want you to know that it takes a lot of courage to write down your thoughts and feelings like this, even if you didn't proofread them. It's a sign that you're willing to face your struggles, even if it's just in a private moment.

It's understandable that the idea of seeking therapy or doing everyday tasks feels daunting, but I want to assure you that it's not impossible. There are many therapists who offer online sessions or phone calls, which might make it feel more accessible. You don't have to face this alone, and there are people who want to help you work through your anxiety and find ways to make life feel more manageable.

Remember, you're not pathetic or wasting your life. You're struggling, and that's okay. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. I'm here to listen, and I want to support you in any way I can.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy, exhausting load, and feeling stuck in a loop that’s hard to break. You’re not alone—many people feel trapped by anxiety in ways that make even simple tasks feel impossible. The first thing to remember is that you’re not “pathetic” or “wasting your life”; you’re dealing with real, overwhelming stress, and that in itself is a sign of strength—not weakness.

Try breaking things into tiny, concrete steps that feel doable:

1. **One small thing outside the house** (e.g., walk to the trash can or pick up a flyer on the sidewalk).  
2. **Order essentials online**—most grocery sites let you pick up at a curbside slot, so you can stay inside.  
3. **Set a timer for 5 minutes** and write down one thing you want to change. It doesn’t have to be solved—just surfacing it can ease the pressure.  
4. **Reach out via text or a messaging app**","

Your response:
","I love your attitude of defiance towards anxiety! It's fantastic that you not only recognized the anxiety but actively chose to challenge it - and even better, you succeeded! The way you framed it as being ""rude"" to anxiety is actually a really healthy approach - it helps separate ""you"" from ""the anxiety"" and turns it into something you can face down rather than something that controls you.

That moment when you saw the 5-car lineup must have been especially challenging. Many people might have used that as an excuse to turn around, but you ""doubled down"" instead. That's real courage - not the absence of fear, but moving forward despite it.

And now you have two victories to celebrate: a clean car AND proof that you can push through anxiety when it tries to limit you. Each time you face down anxiety like this, you build evidence that you're stronger than it wants you to believe.","

","It sounds like you're feeling empowered by standing up to your anxiety and pushing through the discomfort. Acknowledging that anxiety has taken over and actively choosing to defy it is a significant step. By doing so, you're not only getting your car cleaned but also proving to yourself that you can overcome your anxiety.

It's also interesting that you mention loving car washes as a kid, but now the chemical smell is overwhelming. This shift might be a trigger for your anxiety, but by facing it head-on, you're taking back control. The fact that you were able to 'double down' and manage your anxiety when faced with an unexpected lineup shows remarkable resilience.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in the middle of a tug‑of‑war: your body is screaming “no,” but your mind is saying “do it.” That’s a classic anxiety loop, and the fact that you pushed through the line and ended up with a clean, shiny car is a small victory that deserves recognition.  

Instead of labeling the anxiety as “spooks” or “rude,” try to meet it with a gentle, curious question: “What is this feeling trying to teach me?” Often, the discomfort is a sign that something you value—like a clean car—is worth the cost.  

When the next wave of worry comes, pause for a beat, breathe, and remind yourself that you’re already showing up for yourself. Acknowledge the effort, not just the outcome. You’ve proven you can act in spite of fear, and with each step you’re rewiring that response. Keep celebrating those wins, no matter how small.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

cc7boe,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,symph0nica,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",915,79,1562913742,All the time. Even when productive I don’t feel enough is coming out of my hands.,94,jojowiththeflow,"That's not anxiety, you're just excited to do something. 
Start doing something and you will feel great.",-5,LikeHarambeMemes,"It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of pressure to constantly be productive, which is leading to anxiety and a fear of not achieving enough. It's understandable to feel anxious about time slipping away, especially when you're ambitious and have set goals for yourself. The fear of failure and the pressure to always be productive can be paralyzing, making it difficult to start or enjoy activities. 

Recognize that downtime is also valuable and necessary for your mental health. It might help to reframe “wasting time” into “taking a break,” which is essential for recharging. Consider setting small, achievable goals for your free time, which can reduce the sense of overwhelm and help you feel accomplished. Remember, it’s okay to not be productive every moment. 

You’re not alone in these feelings, and it might be helpful to talk to someone who can offer perspective, like a mentor or a counselor. Balancing productivity and relaxation is a common challenge, and finding a rhythm that works for you is key.","

Your response:
","I hear how deeply this internal struggle affects you - wanting to be productive and grow, yet feeling paralyzed by the pressure you put on yourself. It's like you're caught in a cycle where the fear of wasting time actually prevents you from engaging meaningfully with the things you care about.

The way you describe your racing heart and panic when you notice ""wasted time"" suggests this goes beyond simple procrastination. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of expectations about what you ""should"" be accomplishing, and perhaps some deeper fears about your worth being tied to productivity.

I notice how even activities meant for learning and growth, like the Unity course, have become sources of anxiety rather than opportunities. Would it be fair to say that your desire to make the most of your time has paradoxically made it harder to be present and actually engage with life?

Consider that rest and downtime aren't necessarily ""wasted"" time - they're essential parts of being human. Maybe we could explore what makes time feel meaningful to you, beyond just productivity metrics?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling trapped in a cycle of guilt and anxiety about not using your time efficiently. You have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, but the fear of not meeting your own expectations is holding you back. This fear of wasting time and not making the most of your life seems to be deeply connected to a broader fear of not living up to your potential and aging without accomplishing anything meaningful.

I sense a sense of self-pressure and perfectionism in your words. You're setting high standards for yourself, and when you don't meet them, you feel anxious and panic. It's like you're constantly weighing your actions against a mental timeline of what you should be achieving, and when you don't measure up, you feel like you're falling behind.

Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you didn't learn Unity or didn't read those books? What's the worst-case scenario that's playing out in your mind?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught in a loop where the thought “I’m wasting time” triggers anxiety, which then blocks any productive or even relaxing activity. That “time‑is‑money” pressure can feel especially heavy when you’re also worried about aging and not mastering a new skill. A useful trick is to separate *intent* from *outcome*. Write down a realistic, non‑judgmental plan for the day—maybe just 10 minutes of HTML practice, or a 15‑minute walk. When you slip into scrolling, pause, breathe, and label the feeling: “I’m noticing a racing heart and a worry about wasted time.” Acknowledge it without self‑criticism, then gently redirect to the planned task. Over time, you’ll build a habit where the “waste” thought becomes a cue to act, rather than a barrier. Remember, progress is incremental; every small step counts toward the larger goal.","

","I hear how exhausted and discouraged you feel about this ongoing battle with anxiety. It must be really heavy carrying that feeling that this is a permanent part of your life.

The tools and strength you develop can make the load feel lighter over time, even if the anxiety itself doesn't completely disappear.

I'm curious - when you say it's exhausting being ""in your head,"" what does that feel like for you? Sometimes just having someone truly understand and validate those feelings can provide a moment of relief, even if it doesn't solve everything.

Your response:
","I hear how draining it feels to carry that constant inner weight, and it’s understandable that you’re exhausted by the idea of never “getting out” of it. It can feel like a relentless loop—diagnosis, coping, then a new episode. But noticing that pattern is itself a step forward. Many people find that the goal shifts from “cure” to “balance.” Therapy, especially CBT or ACT, and sometimes medication can change how the anxiety shows up, not necessarily erase it. Pairing that with small, manageable habits—grounding exercises, gentle movement, a consistent sleep routine—can make the daily experience feel less all‑or‑nothing. It’s hard, but you’re learning to negotiate that space, and that learning can bring a sense of agency and, over time, a kind of peace that feels very much yours.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: I'm genuinely tired from overthinking and worrying about useless stuff.  Someone hit me, so I could cry instead and divert my focus.

I'm so tired of this cycle of worrying and overthinking. 

Fuck this shit, I want to only focus on good things even though I don't have any, I'll make some, I guess.

","I hear how exhausted you feel—like you’re stuck in a loop of overthinking that’s draining your breath and your energy. It makes sense you’d want to cut that cycle short and focus on something positive, even if it feels impossible right now. Start with small, tangible steps that anchor you in the present: a few slow, deep breaths, a quick body scan, or jotting down one thing you’re grateful for (even a simple cup of tea). These brief pauses can interrupt the spiraling thought pattern and give your heart a chance to settle. Remember, you’re not alone in this; many of us wrestle with the same anxiety‑pulse. Keep reaching out and sharing—your courage in talking about it already lights a path toward relief. You’ve got the strength to create those good moments, even one tiny one at a time.","

iqahuc,Anxiety,Anyone else have their health issues brushed off by medical professionals due to an anxiety diagnosis?,Optimistic_Mute,"
Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance’s nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of “Y’know I’m seeing that you’re a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don’t fly with me as a nurse.” This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real. After talking more he reluctantly suggested I go to the ED. I didn’t go immediately that night because the comments made made me feel like I was overreacting and that my need for care wasn’t important or a waste of time. I did go to the ED that afternoon around 3pm because my rash, itching, and fatigue were only getting worse. I was diagnosed with mites by the ER doctor and prescribed an anti-parasitic which has so far provided some relief. 

I’ve filed a grievance with my insurance because I feel like my dignity as a patient was violated and prevented me from seeking out care. At first I thought maybe this isn’t a big deal but after consulting with friends they said that this was unacceptable and that I should file a report. I’m kind of used to going to the doctor and having them brush things off as anxiety and it just seems like a vicious cycle cuz I never do anything about it because of my anxiety and not wanting to make it a big deal.",843,105,1599766465,[deleted],84,[deleted],"I completely understand! In middle school I started passing out every day, and as a result I would get nervous that I would pass out, have a panic attack, and then pass out again. Turns out I have chronic EDS and POTS, which comes with dysautonomia and sensitivities to temperature. Took me 4 years to get an official diagnosis!",30,kr3pie,"I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. It’s incredibly frustrating and disheartening when medical professionals dismiss your symptoms because of a mental health diagnosis. It’s important to feel heard and validated when seeking medical care, and it sounds like that didn’t happen for you. Your symptoms were real and required attention, as confirmed by your diagnosis and treatment in the ER.

Filing a grievance was a good step. It’s crucial to advocate for yourself in these situations, even though it can be tough, especially when anxiety is involved. You deserve to be treated with respect and to have your concerns taken seriously. It might also be helpful to seek out a medical professional who has a good understanding of both physical and mental health, so they can provide comprehensive care.

Remember, your health and well-being are important, and you deserve to receive the care you need. Keep advocating for yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out for support from friends or mental health professionals if you need it.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrating and invalidating this experience was for you. It's sadly common for medical professionals to dismiss physical symptoms due to mental health diagnoses, creating a harmful cycle where patients feel discouraged from seeking necessary care. You were absolutely right to trust your instincts about your symptoms, and the ED diagnosis proved that your concerns were legitimate.

Filing a grievance was a brave and important step - not just for yourself, but for other patients who might face similar discrimination. Your anxiety diagnosis should never prevent you from receiving respectful, thorough medical care. The nurse's dismissive response was unprofessional and potentially dangerous, as it delayed your treatment for a real medical condition.

Please know that you deserve to be taken seriously when seeking medical help, regardless of your mental health history. Consider bringing an advocate to future appointments if possible, and don't hesitate to seek second opinions when you feel your concerns aren't being properly addressed.","

","I can sense how frustrating and disempowering your experience was. It's completely unacceptable that your concerns were dismissed due to your anxiety diagnosis, and I'm glad you decided to file a grievance with your insurance. It's essential to acknowledge that having anxiety doesn't mean your physical symptoms aren't real or valid. In fact, research suggests that people with anxiety are more likely to experience physical symptoms and may be more attuned to their bodily sensations. 

It's crucial to remember that you deserve to be heard and taken seriously as a patient. Your friends were right in encouraging you to report the incident. It's not about making a big deal; it's about advocating for yourself and ensuring that you receive the care you need. Remember, your health and dignity matter, and you shouldn't let anyone make you feel otherwise.","

Your response:
","I’m really sorry you had to go through that. It feels like your voice and your body were dismissed, which is exactly what an anxiety label should never be used to invalidate. It’s understandable that you left feeling ashamed and hesitant to seek help again. You’re not alone—many people report that their medical history is used as a shortcut to “rule out” physical illness. The right move is to keep standing up for yourself: keep a written record of what happened, share it with a trusted provider or patient advocate, and follow through on the grievance you filed. If you ever feel dismissed again, you can request a second opinion or a referral to a dermatologist who can objectively evaluate the rash. Remember, you deserve thorough care; your symptoms are real and legitimate. Keep advocating—you deserve it.","

Your response:
","I hear how much internal conflict and shame you're feeling right now about calling in sick. It's clear you're caught in a difficult cycle - the anxiety about work leads to avoiding it, which then creates more anxiety and self-criticism. That's really tough to deal with.

You're definitely not alone in this experience. Many people struggle with work-related anxiety, especially when dealing with challenging workplace dynamics or leadership changes. The fact that you're aware of these patterns and concerned about your response shows that you care about your work and want to handle things differently.

Instead of beating yourself up about today, perhaps we could look at this as a signal that something needs to change - whether that's finding ways to manage your anxiety, having a conversation with your boss about expectations, or exploring other work opportunities that better support your wellbeing. Would you be open to sharing more about what specifically about your boss's return is triggering these feelings?

Remember, taking care of your mental health isn't ""running away"" - it's recognizing when you need support.","

","It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt, and it's taking a toll on you. I want you to know that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with anxiety and feelings of inadequacy, especially when it comes to their job.

It's interesting that you mention feeling overwhelmed by the return of your boss, after having a sense of freedom while he was away. It's almost like you're feeling a loss of control. Your body's response, waking up drenched in a cold sweat, is a clear indication of the intense anxiety you're experiencing.

Rather than beating yourself up over calling in sick, maybe try to see it as a sign that you need to take care of yourself. It's okay to acknowledge your limits and take a step back when needed. Have you considered talking to someone, whether it's a trusted friend, family member, or a professional, about how you're feeling? They might be able to offer you some support and help you break this cycle.","

","It’s really hard to feel good about yourself after a day like that, but you’re definitely not alone. Many people find themselves caught in a loop of anxiety and guilt, especially when work feels overwhelming and the boss’s absence makes you feel unmoored. The fact that you recognized your anxiety and chose to rest is actually a sign of self‑awareness, not failure.  

Try framing the day as a “reset” rather than a loss. When you’re ready, jot down one realistic task you can tackle at work—maybe just a quick email or a small project update—and send a brief note to your boss explaining that you had a health‑related break and are back on track. Most managers appreciate transparency, especially if you’re proactive.  

If the anxiety keeps spiraling, consider a short therapy session or CBT strategies (e.g., grounding, thought‑recording). Remember: taking care of your mental health is part of being a reliable employee. You’re not alone, and it’s okay to ask for support","

New personal Query: 

Q: I skipped work today due to my anxiety and now I'm so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever done the same thing?  My job makes me pretty depressed.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?.

The fact that you’re reaching out and sharing your experience shows a lot of self-awareness and courage. Anxiety can manifest in various ways and sometimes over seemingly minor issues, while more serious situations might trigger a numb or dissociative response. This can be confusing and frustrating, but it's important to remember you're not alone in feeling this way.

It might be helpful to explore these feelings with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and strategies to manage anxiety and dissociation. They can help you understand why these reactions occur and work with you to develop coping mechanisms. In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that these responses don’t define your worth or character.

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and confused you are about these seemingly contradictory reactions - panicking over small things like being cold or spilling juice, while feeling numb during more significant moments. It's actually quite common for anxiety to manifest this way, where our nervous system doesn't always match the ""logical"" severity of situations. The dissociation you're describing during more stressful encounters is your mind's way of protecting itself, even if it feels unsettling.

Please know that you don't need to hate yourself for this. These are valid experiences that many people with anxiety go through, and they don't make you ""broken"" or ""wrong."" It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of internal pressure, especially in social situations where you're trying to navigate other people's needs alongside your own discomfort.

Have you considered talking to a mental health professional about these experiences? They can help you understand these patterns and develop coping strategies that work for you.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated with your reactions to certain situations. It's understandable that you would feel that way, especially when it seems like others might not understand why these things are affecting you so much. 

I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings and experiences, especially when it feels like you're struggling to make sense of them yourself. It might be helpful to explore the idea that your body and mind are responding to perceived threats or stressors in a way that's trying to protect you. 

In situations like the ones you described, it's possible that your anxiety is triggered by a sense of loss of control or uncertainty. This can lead to physical symptoms like hyperventilating, lightheadedness, and numbness. It's also possible that in more serious situations, your mind is trying to protect you by disassociating, which can be a coping mechanism.

It's not about hating yourself for being this way; it's about trying to understand and work with your body and mind to find ways to cope with these feelings. Would you be open to exploring some strategies to help manage these situations, or is there something specific that you're hoping to work on first?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of tension that shows up in very different ways, and that’s exhausting. The little things—cold, a sore arm, spilled juice—trigger a fight‑or‑flight surge that makes you hyper‑aware and start to feel like you’re on autopilot. When something feels more serious, the body flips to the opposite extreme, numbing the experience so you can survive the perceived threat. It’s a common pattern in anxiety and trauma responses, not a sign of weakness or “hating yourself.”  

Grounding can help interrupt the cycle: notice three things you can see, two you can touch, one you can hear, and take slow, deep breaths. If the panic feels overwhelming, practice a brief “safe place” visualization or gently remind yourself, “I’m in control right now.”  

Consider speaking with a therapist who can help you map these triggers and develop personalized coping tools. You’re not alone, and you deserve support.","

Your response:
","I hear how draining this cycle of anxiety and fatigue is for you. It sounds really frustrating to feel exhausted no matter how much you rest, and then have that fatigue feed back into more anxiety. You're asking a really insightful question about the connection between your anxiety and tiredness.

Anxiety can absolutely cause significant fatigue - it's like your body and mind are running a constant marathon of worry. The physical and mental energy spent on anxious thoughts can be extremely depleting. However, since you're concerned, it would be worthwhile to check with a healthcare provider to rule out other potential causes like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, or sleep disorders. They can help determine if your fatigue is primarily anxiety-related or if there might be other factors involved.

What you're experiencing - this interplay between anxiety and fatigue - is actually quite common, even though it can feel very isolating when you're going through it.","

","It sounds exhausting—both the fatigue and the constant worrying can feel like a vicious loop.

Your response:
","I hear you, and it's completely understandable to feel hesitant about sharing your thoughts online. It takes courage to be vulnerable, and that fear of judgment is something many of us struggle with. The fact that you're even aware of this pattern shows you're being thoughtful about your interactions.

It's actually quite common to second-guess ourselves before posting - you're definitely not alone in this. The overwhelming response you've received confirms that this is a shared experience. Sometimes we can be our own harshest critics, holding ourselves to higher standards than we would others.

Would you feel comfortable sharing what kind of judgments you're most concerned about? Sometimes naming our fears can help us understand them better and maybe even start to work through them.","

","It’s more common than you think. Many of us hit the “discard” button when the fear of judgment feels too heavy. It usually signals two things at once: a protective instinct (you don’t want criticism or rejection) and a desire for authenticity (you want your voice to be heard). The trick is to separate the impulse from the content. Try pausing, asking yourself, “Is this feedback going to help me grow, or am I protecting myself from a perceived failure?” Once you’ve identified the motive, you can experiment with small, low‑stakes posts or share with a trusted friend first. Remember, every voice that’s","

When I was a kid, I would get so excited the night before/morning of an event (sometimes as small as a trip to the park) that I would get violently physically ill. I ruined a lot of my own birthday parties this way because my parents would need to cancel because I was so sick. I would start off with physical illness, then I'd start to get really upset (now I know these were panic attacks) and cry.

Your response:
","I hear you, and that feeling of unexplained nervousness before any event - even enjoyable ones - can be really frustrating. It sounds like you're experiencing a general state of anxiety rather than specific fears about particular situations. It's actually quite common for people to have this kind of anticipatory anxiety, where the body goes into a nervous state even when the mind knows there's nothing to truly worry about.

The fact that you can't pinpoint exactly why you're nervous suggests this might be more about your body's automatic response system than actual concerns about the events themselves. Many people experience this - what should be excitement gets interpreted by our bodies as anxiety, and it can feel confusing and overwhelming.

Would you like to talk more about when you first noticed this pattern, or what kinds of situations tend to trigger this feeling the most?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a blanket of nervousness that shows up even when things should feel light or exciting. You’re not alone—many people experience what’s called anticipatory anxiety or a kind of “always‑on” tension that isn’t tied to a single event. It can stem from past experiences, perfectionistic expectations, or even subtle changes in hormones or sleep.

One way to start untangling it is to notice when the feeling first appears: Does it rise a few minutes before an activity, or does it build over hours? Try grounding techniques—slow, deep breaths, or a quick body scan—to bring awareness to the present moment.

Why the gym? Is it just about physical health, or does movement feel like a release? And when you reach out to those friends, what do you hope to gain? Shared stories, fresh perspectives, or simply a sense that you’re not alone?  

By aligning each activity with a deeper intention, you’ll keep that anxiety‑free energy focused, and you’ll build a lasting, balanced routine. Good luck—your plan already feels promising!","

","It’s more common than you think to keep anxiety “in the background” until life slows down a bit and you can face it. The fact that you’ve already tried meds and therapy shows you’re taking steps—just the next layer is the day‑to‑day practice.  

Try to pair your professional help with small, consistent habits:  
* **Movement** – even a 10‑minute walk can reset the nervous system.  
* **Mindful pause** – a 5‑minute breathing or body scan before a stressful task.  
* **Journaling** – write what triggered the anxiety and what you did to soothe it; patterns emerge over time.  

Remember, progress is incremental. Celebrate the small victories, and give yourself permission to be imperfect while you build that new routine. You’re not alone, and each new habit is a step toward a richer, calmer life.","

Your response:
","I hear how unsettling this uncertainty is for you. It's completely understandable to feel anxious about these symptoms, especially given the overlap between anxiety and COVID symptoms. The fact that you're reaching out and connecting with others who share similar worries shows you're handling this thoughtfully. I'm glad you're finding some comfort in knowing you're not alone in this experience. Remember that while it's natural to have these concerns, if you're really worried about your symptoms, it's always okay to check in with a healthcare provider for peace of mind. They can help you distinguish between anxiety and other health issues, and that clarity might help ease some of your worry.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of uncertainty and self-doubt, where it's hard to distinguish between anxiety and a potential health issue like corona. On one hand, your body is sending you signals that something might be off, but on the other, your mind is racing with possibilities. It's almost like you're trying to be your own doctor, and that can be overwhelming. I sense that beneath your concern about your physical health, there might be an underlying fear of being vulnerable or losing control. Would you say that's true?","

Your response:
","I hear how anxious that uncertainty can feel—shortness of breath is a symptom that can stem from many places, and both anxiety and COVID‑19 (or other respiratory infections) are common culprits. You’re not alone in that doubt; many people are navigating the same question right now.

A good first step is to note any other clues: fever, cough, loss of taste, or recent exposure. If you’re experiencing any of those, or if the breathlessness is worsening or you’re feeling chest pressure, it’s safest to call your healthcare provider or a local urgent care center for a quick check‑up and possibly a rapid test. If you’ve already tested negative and your symptoms are mild, a brief period of monitoring and gradual re‑introduction of gentle activity can help determine if anxiety is the main driver—often the pattern of breathlessness will feel more","

This is a common experience for many people. Sometimes, our brains revisit past situations to process emotions or gain new insights. It can be tough when these thoughts surface unexpectedly, but it might be an opportunity for you to reflect and understand how those events have shaped who you are today. If these thoughts become overwhelming or distressing, it might be helpful to talk to someone about it, like a friend or a mental health professional. They can provide support and help you find ways to cope with these memories. Remember, it's okay to feel this way, and seeking understanding is a positive step forward.","

Your response:
","Yes, this is actually quite common and normal. It sounds like these memories surface unexpectedly and maybe cause you some distress. Many people experience sudden flashbacks or memories of difficult past experiences - it's part of how our brains process and try to make sense of things that impacted us. While it can be uncomfortable, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with you.

Would you like to share more about how these thoughts affect you when they come up? Sometimes talking about it can help put these experiences in perspective and make them feel less overwhelming.","

Q: Does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?  I do it periodically .

Your response:
","It sounds like you're experiencing something that can be quite unsettling. Yes, it's not uncommon for people to suddenly think about past traumatic or distressing events years later. This phenomenon is often referred to as ""intrusive memories"" or ""flashbacks."" It's possible that your mind is processing and re-examining past experiences, trying to make sense of them or find closure.

It might be helpful to explore what triggers these memories for you. Are there specific emotions, environments, or situations that tend to bring them to the surface? Understanding these triggers can help you better prepare and cope when these memories arise. Additionally, acknowledging that these memories are a normal part of your healing process can help alleviate some of the distress associated with them.","

Q: Does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?  I do it periodically .

Your response:
","It’s actually more common than you might think. Our brains are wired to keep a running archive of events—especially the ones that hurt us—so they can warn us if similar danger appears. Those “random” flash‑backs can surface years later, often triggered by a scent, sound, or even a mundane conversation that reminds you of the earlier pain. They’re usually not a sign of something deeper than “I’m still bothered by it”; they’re just the brain’s way of replaying an unresolved memory.

If the thoughts feel intrusive or distressing, a few quick tools can help: pause, take a few deep breaths, or ground yourself by naming five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, and one you taste. Writing the memory in a journal can also help you separate the event from your present life.","

apyki0,Anxiety,I am too sensitive for this world,twpop2,"Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can’t figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it’s humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I’m turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can’t seem to win. I can’t even check my email anymore because I’m so afraid to see someone saying I’ve done something wrong. I don’t feel as if I was made to fit into this world where I can’t even be told I’m not doing good enough without completely breaking down. What can I even do?

Today I had the worst day I've had in a while. Very similar to the situations you described. Just as I thought I was becoming pretty good at this adulting thing, it felt like I had reverted to being a little kid. Scared of making mistakes. Unable to control my behavior. It was an awful feeling. I'm glad it's over now, but like you, it's pretty fucking humiliating. And disappointing...you feel like you're getting your shit together and then everything just falls apart again one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what you can do. All I know of is just find some degree of peace tonight and start again tomorrow. I wonder, are you always so anxious that you get tearful? Or do you normally just feel bad but without crying?

&amp;#x200B;

Is feeling incompetent something that's been bothering you for a while now? Have you been comparing yourself to other people a lot more lately, like there's something to lose if you aren't the best (e.g. a new coworker that might perform better than you, a new mutual friend with your partner that might get new attention, hope that you could successfully achieve your goals if you don't do well at your current job now)? All of those things can stack up and it sounds like maybe you have a lot more behind your anxiety than usual since you're posting this.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm finding that my returning depression is making my anxiety a lot more crybaby-ish and prone to catastrophizing than usual.

Sending good vibes. Let's try to make tomorrow a little better (or more realistically, just not as bad).",19,vitamin-water,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it’s impacting many areas of your life. It’s important to recognize that being sensitive isn’t a flaw—it can be a sign of deep empathy and insight. However, it seems like your sensitivity is causing you distress, especially when it comes to handling criticism or perceived mistakes.

One thing that might help is developing strategies for emotional regulation. This could involve learning techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, or grounding exercises that can help you manage your emotions in the moment. It might also be helpful to explore these feelings with a therapist, who can provide support and help you build resilience over time.

Remember, it’s okay to be sensitive, but it’s also okay to seek help and work on developing coping mechanisms. You’re not alone in this, and there are people who can support you in finding a balance that works for you.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: I am too sensitive for this world  Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can’t figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it’s humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I’m turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can’t seem to win. I can’t even check my email anymore because I’m so afraid to see someone saying I’ve done something wrong. I don’t feel as if I was made to fit into this world where I can’t even be told I’m not doing good enough without completely breaking down. What can I even do? I feel like I’ve lost all control of my life..

Your response:
","I hear how overwhelmed and trapped you're feeling in this cycle of sensitivity, tears, and shame. It's especially difficult when your natural responses are being misinterpreted as aloofness, and when you're told to simply ""toughen up"" - as if it were that simple. Your feelings aren't wrong or broken - they're telling you something important.

It sounds like you're carrying an incredibly heavy burden of perfectionism and fear of judgment, to the point where even checking email has become a source of anxiety. The fact that you're aware of these patterns and reaching out shows real strength and self-awareness.

Instead of seeing your sensitivity as a flaw, perhaps we can explore ways to work with it rather than against it. Would you be open to talking about what ""good enough"" means to you, and where those standards came from? Sometimes understanding the root of these feelings can be the first step toward managing them in a way that feels less overwhelming.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling incredibly overwhelmed and caught in a cycle of self-doubt and shame. The fact that you're breaking down in tears when faced with criticism or perceived failure suggests that you're deeply invested in doing well and being perceived positively. Rather than having a 'thick skin,' it seems like you have a highly sensitive and empathetic nature, which can be both a strength and a challenge.

It's essential to recognize that your sensitivity is not a flaw, but rather a natural part of who you are. Instead of trying to change your fundamental nature, it might be more helpful to focus on developing coping strategies and self-compassion. This could involve practicing mindfulness, learning to reframe criticism as opportunities for growth, and cultivating a support network that acknowledges and appreciates your unique strengths and vulnerabilities. Remember that you don't have to navigate this alone; seeking guidance from a therapist or trusted mentor could provide you with the tools and support you need to regain control and confidence in your life.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pressure that’s turning into an emotional flood, and that’s exhausting. Feeling a tear start after a small slip isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a signal that your nervous system is on over‑drive, trying to cope with fear of judgment. The “thicker skin” advice misses the point: you don’t need a thicker skin, you need a healthier way to process that pressure.  
Try these small steps:  
1. **Ground yourself** when a tear starts—breathe in for 4, hold 4, exhale 4.  
2. **Reframe the “mistake”** as a learning moment, not a verdict.  
3. **Set micro‑goals** (e.g., “I’ll email this one thing today”) to build confidence.  
4. **Practice self‑compassion**—write a kind note to yourself as you would to a friend.  
5. If the waves feel unmanageable, a therapist trained in CBT or ACT can help you","

You’ve taken a strong, informed stance by referencing the EU law and ensuring your rights are respected, which demonstrates your determination and resourcefulness. While it’s natural to worry about what others might think, focusing on the facts rather than assumptions can help. Consider that customer support professionals are there to help resolve such issues, and approaching the situation calmly can often lead to a positive outcome.

","I hear how anxious you're feeling about opening that email. It sounds like you've done everything right - researched the law, stood up for your consumer rights, and communicated professionally. Yet there's still this fear about facing their response and potentially being judged. It's actually quite common to avoid checking emails or messages when we're worried about conflict or negative responses, even when we know we're in the right.

What I'm picking up is that this might be less about the actual email content and more about the discomfort of confrontation and potential disapproval. Would it help to remember that you're not asking for anything unreasonable - you're simply requesting what you're legally entitled to as a consumer?","

That fear is common—especially when we’ve already stood up for our rights and worry the other side might backtrack or react negatively. One small step that can ease the anxiety is to mentally prepare a simple, neutral opening: “I’m looking forward to your reply.” This frames the email as a routine exchange rather than a confrontation. Remind yourself that the company has a duty to act under EU law, and that’s what you’re asserting. If the reply is less than you hoped, you’ll still have documented proof of your attempt and a clear basis for further action. So open it when you feel ready; you’ve already taken the right first move.","

Terrible cycle 😭",347,ashleyorwhatever,"It sounds like those hot flashes are really uncomfortable for you. Anxiety can manifest in various physical symptoms, and it's tough when they disrupt your day. It's clear you're actively trying to manage them with ice packs and fans, which shows you're taking steps to cope. Everyone experiences anxiety differently, and for some, it might be a racing heart or feeling dizzy. Managing these symptoms can be challenging, but you're not alone in this. Have you found any other techniques or strategies that help you manage your anxiety symptoms? Sometimes combining different approaches, like deep breathing or mindfulness, can also make a difference.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: Least favorite anxiety symptom?  For me, it’s the hot flashes. Just feeling hot all over my body and having to sit here with ice packs and fans until the anxiety passes..

Your response:
","I hear how uncomfortable and distressing those hot flashes are for you. It's really challenging to have to physically manage anxiety symptoms while also dealing with the mental distress. The full-body heat sensation can feel so overwhelming, and having to rely on ice packs and fans just to get through those moments must be frustrating. While everyone's anxiety manifests differently, physical symptoms like this can be particularly difficult because they're so tangible and hard to ignore. It's completely valid to find these symptoms especially bothersome. Would you like to share more about what helps you cope during these episodes, besides the cooling methods you mentioned?","

Your response:
","It sounds like those hot flashes can be quite overwhelming for you. It's interesting that you mention feeling the need to sit with ice packs and fans until the anxiety passes - it suggests that you've found ways to cope with the physical sensations, but maybe the emotional aspect is still challenging. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you didn't have those cooling aids nearby when an anxiety episode strikes? How do you think that would affect your experience of the hot flashes?","

Your response:
","It sounds like those hot flashes are a real pain—both literally and emotionally. When anxiety triggers a surge of warmth all over, it can feel like the body is shouting “stop!” even if you’re sitting still. One trick is to pair cooling with grounding: start a slow, deep‑breath pattern (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6) while consciously naming five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. The rhythmic breath helps redirect the nervous system, while the sensory focus pulls you back to the present. Keep a small, cool face‑mask or chilled compress handy, and if the heat persists, it might be worth chatting with your clinician","

9xm7w6,Anxiety,"I bought myself tickets to a concert about two months ago just for myself. I forgot about it until this week, but I’ve been really excited about it! Every single day, I’ve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. I’m not even worried I’m going by myself.",lamy0720,"Edit: Friends, I made it! I got dressed up, made it to the venue, and I’m here! ",1087,110,1542375437,Excellent! Who are you going to see?,52,buttw0rm,"WELL I didnt make it to a stage on my own. BUT I danced and not next to the people I went with I went and stood further up on my own.. a little bit.. lol. It was a Trance Festival and everyone at Trance shows make me feel very comfortable. They are all so happy and Friendly. Easing myself into it. 

Ill leave you with this crazyness. And thank you a ton 

 Ive been having a reoccurring dream about going to the beach.. and I never get there. I can see the beach but something always happens keeping me from going to the beach. I like to dissect dreams... but I left this one alone because In reality.. ive been wanting to visit a real beach for a long time. I haven't been in years. So I though it was just a desire. 

I finally took the dream apart after I had a weird beach dream.. I found the beach in this dream and I fell to my knees to feel the sand and the sand turned into brown carpet. So i lifted up the carpet to look for the sand and there was another layer of carpet, I kept lifting up the layers of carpet (there were 3) and then there was this hole or window or something Where i could see the real beach and I became very upset because there were so many people on the beach that there was no place for me to sit and enjoy the peace and serenity. 

Anyway the dream ended up up being completely symbolic. The Beach is a Symbolic for the meeting place between my rational self (the Sand) and my emotional self (the water). The carpet was symbolic for the harsh realities of my life, the carpet being brown and dirty was symbolic for the foundation or comfort zone I have laid out for myself is no longer working for me and that I am refusing to confront issues in my life. Peeling up Carpet was symbolic that the way i view the world will be drastically changed and will specifically challenge my comfort zone. 

The sea specifically is symbolic for Emotional turbulence in my life and the everything that I worry about will resolve itself I overwhelm myself with my own emotions.. So I could see the resolution in my dreams.. but in this one.. the only thing keeping me from reaching that was all of the people I didnt want to be around. 
And what hit home for me here.. was the symbol of a crowded beach, It means that I seek company and a social life. It is the bridge that I need to cross to find the ocean.. My peace.. the meeting place between my rational and emotional mind. 
I am aware that Socializing is healthy.. and I used to at least try. Until I turned about 22 years old.. I spent the next two years avoiding people like the plague. Which is sad for me.. because I enjoy helping people, even if its out of blunt honesty and tons of people say I make them feel so good and happy Like I am a light in the dark.. but I just get so overwhelmed around them all. When I am not helping with problems..I dont know what to say. Advise comes easily out of my mouth.. but regular conversation.... no. there is no dictionary in my mind for that. 

Any way I thought it was a bit synchronistic that I was talking to you about trying to be social and then also got the message from my dream that Its time for me to try again. So thank you for contributing to that. 
",1,s0nder369thOughts,"That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you made a wonderful decision to treat yourself to a concert experience, and it's great that you're feeling so excited and positive about being there.

It's awesome that you embraced the opportunity to get dressed up and fully enjoy the moment. You deserve this joyful experience, and it's a testament to your courage and enthusiasm that you went ahead, even solo. I hope the concert is everything you hoped for and more!

Your response:
","I hear how painful these realizations are, and it's completely understandable that they're affecting you now, even after building a successful life. It sounds like you're grappling with memories that feel fresh despite happening years ago, especially since this understanding has hit you suddenly.

Many people experience similar delayed processing of past hurts, particularly from high school when we were all vulnerable and developing our sense of self. The fact that you've achieved success in college and your career shows remarkable resilience, even while carrying these wounds.

What strikes me is how you mention being ""the only one not knowing"" - that must have felt incredibly isolating when you finally understood. It's natural to revisit these memories as an adult when we have new perspective to process them. While you see yourself as having been ""a loser,"" I see someone who was trusting and genuine enough to believe in others' friendship, and strong enough to build a good life despite that treatment.

Would you like to talk more about what triggered these memories to surface now?","

It's possible that your recent realization is triggering feelings of shame or inadequacy, which may be linked to your ongoing struggle with self-esteem. However, it's essential to acknowledge that you've made significant progress since high school, achieving success in college and your career.

It's also worth considering that your brain might be trying to reprocess these memories in an attempt to heal and gain closure. This is a common phenomenon, especially during times of personal growth or significant life changes. 

Rather than beating yourself up over the past, try to focus on the present and the progress you've made. Remind yourself that those experiences, although painful, have contributed to your personal growth and the person you are today.","

Expert reasoning dialog:

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?  I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?.

Your response:
","It sounds like those high‑school memories are resurfacing because they still feel like unfinished business for you—an unresolved story that keeps tugging at your self‑image. It’s pretty common for people to revisit those painful moments long after the fact; the brain often keeps them in a loop until we actively let them go or reframe them. You’re already doing the hard work of building a successful life outside of that past, which shows resilience. A useful next step is to treat the memories as stories you can narrate differently: instead of “I was the joke,” try “I learned how to navigate a difficult social environment.” Journaling or talking with a therapist can help you separate the shame from the facts of who you are now. Remember, the fact that you’ve grown and succeeded is a powerful counter‑story—give yourself permission to honor that without the weight of those old humiliations.","

This can often lead to a cycle of negative thinking and self-blame, which can be overwhelming. It's important to recognize that these scenarios are just thoughts and not actual events. One approach to managing this is to practice mindfulness, which can help you become more aware of when your mind starts creating these scenarios and allow you to gently redirect your focus. Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or journaling about your feelings can also be helpful in breaking the cycle. Remember, you're not alone in experiencing this, and reaching out to a mental health professional can provide you with strategies tailored to your situation. It's crucial to be kind to yourself and understand that these thoughts don't define who you are.","

Your response:
","I hear how distressing these mental scenarios are for you - they feel so real that they can bring you to tears and leave you feeling guilty, even though they haven't actually happened. This experience of getting caught up in imagined arguments and negative ""what-if"" situations is actually quite common. It sounds like you're experiencing what's sometimes called ""emotional rehearsal"" or rumination, where our minds play out possible scenarios, often focusing on the worst outcomes.

The fact that these thoughts affect you so deeply shows you're someone who cares a lot about your relationships and wants to avoid conflict or hurting others. While it's natural to mentally prepare for difficult situations, when these thoughts become overwhelming and cause real emotional distress, it may be helpful to talk to someone about tools for managing them. You're not alone in experiencing this, and recognizing that these thoughts are affecting you is an important first step.

Your response:
","It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of rumination and catastrophizing – a pattern of negative thinking where you're creating hypothetical scenarios, imagining worst-case outcomes, and emotionally responding to those scenarios as if they're real. This can be overwhelming and distressing.

It's common for people to engage in mental rehearsals or 'what-if' scenarios, especially when they're anxious or uncertain. However, when these thoughts become intrusive, distressing, and emotionally charged, it can be a sign of underlying anxiety, stress, or low self-esteem.

It's interesting that you acknowledge the negative thoughts and the emotional impact they have on you. That self-awareness is a great starting point. Recognizing these patterns can help you develop strategies to manage them, such as challenging those thoughts, practicing mindfulness, or seeking social support.

","I hear so much pain and frustration in your words. It's particularly difficult when others minimize your struggles by comparing them to different hardships. Your suffering is valid - it's not a competition, and being told to ""man up"" or that others have it worse only adds shame to an already challenging situation.

It takes courage to share these feelings, even if it was hard to get the words out. The daily battle with tasks that others find simple, the isolation of feeling misunderstood, and the internal conflict of questioning your own struggles - these are all real and significant challenges you're facing.

Your illness is real, and its impact on your life is real. You don't need to justify your pain or compare it to others'. Would you be open to talking about what kind of understanding or support would actually be helpful for you, rather than the dismissive responses you've been getting?","

","I can sense the frustration and desperation in your words. It's heartbreaking to feel like your struggles are minimized and invalidated by those around you.

Q: I hate how much the society and the people around us underestimate how crippling this illness is  All my life I've been told to ""man up"", to ""stop being scared of every little thing"", to ""just be confident"", i feel so defective as a human being.

I'm told so many times that there's people with much worse problems doing better than me and i don't even know what true suffering is, people tell me how there's so many kids in the world that don't even have food to eat and this makes me hate myself and my problems even more, it's like I dont even get any sympathy for my problems, no one understands except these little forums on reddit, the outside world is a lot different.
I've done everything these I was told to do, nothing worked, no one realises how difficult it is for me to do the most petty, trivial and small things, i have 0 people to vent and who understand, it was hard for me to even write this post, i have hundreds of thoughts in my mind but none of them come out when i try to type or speak them out. Life's game is in extreme difficulty mode..

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and exhausted you feel—like everyone else’s struggles are on a different level, and yours is invisible or dismissed. That’s a heavy, isolating burden. It’s not a sign of weakness that you’re still trying to manage day‑to‑day tasks; it’s a clear indicator that the illness is profoundly impacting your life. You deserve empathy, not a list of “just” or “compare yourself.” It helps to remember that not everyone can understand your experience, but that doesn’t make it less real. You might find it useful to set very small, concrete goals—just one thing that feels manageable—and celebrate that. If you haven’t yet, reaching out to a therapist who specializes in chronic illness could give you a safe space to talk without judgment. You’re not defective; you’re dealing with a difficult, chronic reality that many people overlook. You deserve support and understanding.","

I have social anxiety idk if that has anything to do with that,96,thatsepicktbh,"My reaction is consistent but it’s more annoyed and aggravated then fear.

Do you suffer from social anxiety or extremely shyness as well?",19,GidOff_MuLawn,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety around phone calls, and you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Many people find phone calls daunting because they can feel immediate and unpredictable, much like an oral exam, as you mentioned. This anxiety often stems from the fear of being judged or making mistakes in real-time, without the chance to edit or prepare your responses.

To overcome this fear, it might help to practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or grounding exercises, before making or receiving a call. These can help calm your nervous system and reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety. Additionally, preparing a few notes or key points you want to discuss can give you a sense of control. Over time, gradually increasing your exposure to phone calls, starting with shorter or less intimidating ones, can also help desensitize you to the fear. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and with small steps, you can work towards managing this fear more effectively.","

Your response:
","I hear how distressing phone calls are for you, and you're definitely not alone in this. The physical symptoms you describe - the racing heart, feeling hot, shivering - those are very real manifestations of anxiety that many people experience with phone calls. It's interesting how you compare it to an unprepared oral exam - that really captures the feeling of being ""put on the spot"" that makes calls so challenging.

This fear often stems from the lack of visual cues we get in face-to-face communication, making calls feel more unpredictable and harder to control. Plus, the immediate nature of phone calls can feel very demanding, unlike texts or emails where we have time to think about our responses.

Have you considered starting with small steps to build confidence? Maybe practicing with someone you trust, or writing down key points before making calls? Some people find it helpful to schedule calls in advance so they feel more prepared. Remember, it's okay to work through this at your own pace - many people struggle with phone anxiety and have found ways to manage it over time.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of anxiety when it comes to phone calls. You're not alone in this feeling; many people struggle with phone-related anxiety, which can be attributed to the spontaneity and unpredictability of conversations. It's as if you're being put on the spot, without having the time to prepare your thoughts or gather your composure.

This fear can stem from various sources, such as fear of rejection, fear of being judged, or fear of not being able to respond adequately. In your case, the comparison to an oral exam is quite fitting, as it highlights the feeling of being unprepared and being put on the spot.

To overcome this fear, it might be helpful to take small steps in gradually exposing yourself to phone calls. You could start by making small, low-stakes calls, such as ordering food or making a reservation. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually move on to more significant conversations. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or visualization, can help you manage your anxiety levels during calls.","

Your response:
","I hear you—phone calls can feel like an unprepared exam, and the sudden rush of heat and shaking signals a real, automatic stress response. It’s common: the phone puts you “on the spot,” and the brain’s fight‑or‑flight circuit can kick in, especially if past experiences—maybe a tense call or a critique—left a lasting imprint.

You’re not alone. Many people share this anxiety, and several strategies can help. Try “pre‑call rehearsal”: jot down key points, practice a short script, and visualize a calm conversation. When the call arrives, pause, take a slow breath, and remind yourself you’re in control of the pace. Gradually expose yourself to short, low‑stakes calls (text to call, or a friend) and slowly build confidence. If it feels overwhelming, consider a brief session with a therapist who can teach grounding techniques. You’re not “bad”; you’re facing a common fear, and you can learn to manage it.","

Anxiety can manifest in various ways, including the physical sensations you described, such as a racing heart, stomach issues, and difficulty breathing.

It's important to acknowledge how you're feeling and consider reaching out for support, whether it be from friends, family, or a mental health professional. They can offer guidance and strategies to help manage your anxiety, especially during challenging times like exams. Techniques such as mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, or even talking about your feelings can be incredibly beneficial.

Your response:
","I hear how overwhelming and physically draining this anxiety has been for you. It's completely normal for anxiety to manifest in physical symptoms - from nausea to racing heart to difficulty breathing. What you experienced during that betrayal was incredibly traumatic, and it makes sense that your body still carries some of those reactions, even though you're in a better place now.

It sounds really frustrating to feel like everyday tasks require so much more energy from you compared to others, especially with school and upcoming exams. That constant physical tension and nausea must be exhausting to deal with daily.

While these physical anxiety responses are common, the intensity you're describing might be worth discussing with a counselor or doctor who can help you develop specific coping strategies. You shouldn't have to navigate this alone. Would you be open to talking to someone about ways to manage these symptoms, especially before your speaking exam?","

Your response:
","I hear how exhausting it’s been for you—when anxiety feels like a storm that makes your stomach flip and your breath catch, it can feel like a full‑body panic attack. You’re not alone; many people experience physical symptoms—shortness of breath, nausea, a racing heart—especially when a major stressor (like a cheating partner, exams, or a speaking test) hits.

A good first step is to treat the body as part of the healing process: try grounding techniques (4‑7‑8 breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) right before you feel the surge, and keep a simple routine—wake, eat, move, sleep—so your body knows what to expect. If the symptoms persist or interfere with daily life, a brief visit to a GP or a mental‑health professional can help rule out anything medical and give you targeted strategies (CBT, mindfulness, or even a short course of medication if needed).

You’ve already shown resilience—recognizing the pattern, forgiving yourself, and moving forward with a supportive partner. Give yourself permission to invest the extra effort in your own care; it doesn’t mean you’re overreacting—it just means you’re listening to the signals your body is sending. You deserve that extra care.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

New personal Query: 

Q: does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?  about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn’t breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn’t worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it’s over now and i’m with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven’t been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that’s coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks..

I feel traumatised. It's been 2 years since my phone is on silent mode. I dont know why. I hate it though.,122,doraemon_bhaiya,I'll take it a step further... How about finally working the courage to make a call and it goes to voicemail!,46,bringingdownthehorse,"It sounds like the sound of a phone ringing or vibrating triggers a lot of anxiety for you, and you're certainly not alone in feeling this way. Many people find phone calls to be intrusive or anxiety-inducing, especially if they're unexpected. The association of an incoming call with bad news or unwanted communication can amplify these feelings. It's interesting that you mentioned the song ""Internet Friends"" by Knife Party, as music and its elements can have strong psychological effects. Perhaps this track heightens your sensitivity to phone sounds because it mirrors real-life triggers for you. 

Your experience with calling your own mobile phone and feeling anxious even while holding it is quite telling. It suggests that the sound itself, more than the act of communication, is what affects you. If this anxiety is disruptive, you might explore strategies to manage it, like gradually desensitizing yourself to phone sounds or seeking support from a therapist who can help you work through these feelings. Remember, acknowledging and understanding your anxiety is a valuable step toward addressing it.","

Your response:
","I hear how distressing those phone sounds are for you, and it's completely valid to have such a strong reaction. The fact that even testing your own phones caused physical anxiety symptoms shows how real this fear is. It sounds like there's an underlying worry that unexpected calls bring bad news or unwanted interactions, which is something many people struggle with.

You're definitely not alone in this. Phone anxiety is increasingly common, especially in an age where we're used to more controlled, text-based communication. The vibration or ring represents an immediate demand for attention that can feel very intrusive and threatening.

Would you feel comfortable sharing more about when you first noticed this reaction to phone sounds? Sometimes understanding the origin of our anxieties can help us make sense of them, though the feelings themselves are already completely valid.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're experiencing a strong emotional response to the sound of a phone ringing or vibrating. This is more common than you might think. Some people may feel a similar sense of anxiety due to past experiences or associations with phone calls, such as receiving unpleasant news or having a fear of being interrupted.

Your reaction to the song ""Internet Friends"" and even the experiment of calling your mobile phone from your house phone suggests a deep-seated emotional response. It's possible that the sound of a phone vibrating has become a trigger for you, associated with feelings of uncertainty or potential negative news.

It's interesting that you mention nobody should be calling you, which implies that you're anticipating something negative. This might be a reflection of your underlying anxiety and fear of the unknown. Exploring the root of these feelings could help you better understand and manage your response to the sound of a phone vibrating.","

","I hear you—when your phone vibrates, it can feel like an unexpected intruder in your space, and that can trigger a spike in heart‑rate and worry. It’s more common than you think: many people with anxiety or even just a strong sense of personal boundaries get rattled by that sudden jolt of vibration. Your experience of holding two phones together and feeling your pulse rise shows that even the anticipation, not just the actual call, can set off a stress response.

A few things might help:  
- Turn off vibration or set the phone to silent while you’re in a calm area.  
- Use a “Do Not Disturb” schedule so you know when it’s safe to let the phone ring.  
- Ground yourself before any phone use—breathing exercises","

The connection between our mind and body is strong, and stress or anxiety can certainly impact your digestive system. You're not alone in experiencing these symptoms. It might be helpful to explore some stress-reduction techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or gentle physical activity to see if they help alleviate your symptoms. Additionally, paying attention to your diet and avoiding foods that can exacerbate these issues might also be beneficial. If your symptoms persist, it may be a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any other underlying conditions and to discuss possible treatment options.

","I hear how uncomfortable and distressing these physical symptoms are for you. It's actually very common for anxiety to directly affect our digestive system - what you're describing with the nervous stomach, gas, and diarrhea are classic anxiety-related symptoms that many people experience. Our gut and brain are closely connected, which is why we feel butterflies when nervous or get digestive issues during stressful times. You're definitely not alone in this experience. Would you like to share more about when these symptoms tend to occur or what kind of anxiety you're dealing with?

Your response:
","It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I can sense the discomfort and frustration in your words. Anxiety can indeed wreak havoc on our stomachs, and it's not uncommon to experience gas, bloating, and other digestive issues. Many people struggle with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nervous stomach, which can be triggered or exacerbated by anxiety. It's as if your body is responding to the stress and tension in your mind, causing physical discomfort. Would you say that your stomach issues tend to worsen when you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed?","

Q: Guys, is anyone here having stomach problems because of anxiety ?  I mean despite diarrhea, are you having gases and just a nervous stomach ?.

Your response:
","It’s more common than you think. Anxiety triggers the gut’s “brain‑gut axis,” so even without diarrhea you can get gas, bloating, cramps or that “nervous stomach” feeling. Many people notice these symptoms flare up when worries spike, and the cycle can feel hard to break.

If it’s bothering you, try a few quick steps:  
– **Mindful breathing** or the 4‑7‑8 technique to calm the nervous system.  
– **Grounding exercises** (e.g., 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 sensory list) right before meals.  
– **Regular, light exercise** (a short walk can ease gas).  
– **Probiotics or fermented foods** to support gut balance (just start small).  
– **Track triggers**: note what thoughts or foods precede symptoms.

If the discomfort persists or worsens, consider speaking to a therapist or","

Landing your first job is a huge accomplishment, especially when you've faced challenges like overthinking and anxiety.

Those worries about starting work? They're completely normal, even for people without anxiety. But look at how you're handling it - ""that's a problem for me later."" That's such a healthy perspective! You're allowing yourself to celebrate this victory first.

You're absolutely right - it can and does get better. This is proof of that. Congratulations on your first job! 🎉","

It's important to recognize that you're not alone in feeling this way. It might help to break tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps. For instance, setting aside specific times in your day to address emails or texts can help make the process feel less daunting. Also, consider prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance, which might help you feel more in control. 

Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and take breaks when you need them. Reaching out to someone you trust to talk about how you're feeling might also provide some relief and perspective. You've got a lot on your plate, but with some strategies, you can work through it.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Does anyone else get overwhelmed and anxious as soon as they have a responsibility to fulfil (answering a text, an email, etc.)?  I’m going back to law school next week, and a bunch of communication from volunteering groups, clubs, friends, etc. have started up again. I feel like crawling under my covers every time I think about having to schedule a meeting or return a phone call to someone. It hasn’t ever been this bad before. I don’t even want to answer texts from my friends that are back in town, because that means we need to get together. 

Ex: I had to send a mass email to a few organizations to see if they wanted to arrange a presentation with my volunteer group. I’ve already received a voicemail and an email in response. The idea of needing to respond and figure out logistics makes me body turn to stone. I just want to ignore it all and pretend I never heard back from anyone...

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you snap out of it?.

Your response:
","I hear how overwhelming and paralyzing this feels for you right now, especially with all these responsibilities piling up at once before law school starts. It's completely understandable that your body and mind are reacting this way - it sounds like the weight of each interaction feels incredibly heavy, even with friends.

What you're describing - that feeling of wanting to hide under the covers and the physical sensation of turning to stone - is actually quite common when people feel overwhelmed by social and organizational demands. You're definitely not alone in this experience.

The fact that this feels worse than before suggests you might be experiencing a heightened stress response, possibly due to the upcoming transition back to law school. Sometimes when we're facing big changes, even small tasks can feel monumentally difficult.

Would you feel comfortable sharing what you think has changed compared to previous times when these responsibilities felt more manageable? Understanding this might help us explore ways to make these tasks feel less overwhelming.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the weight of responsibilities and social expectations that come with going back to law school and reconnecting with others. You're not alone in feeling this way; many people experience anxiety when faced with tasks that require communication and commitment. It's possible that the added pressure of law school has heightened your sensitivity to these tasks.

Your description of feeling like crawling under the covers and having your body turn to stone is a vivid illustration of the physical toll anxiety can take. It's essential to recognize that this is a normal response to feeling overwhelmed. While it might not be possible to ""snap out of it"" immediately, acknowledging your feelings and taking small steps to address them can help. Have you considered breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, or setting aside dedicated time to respond to messages and schedule meetings?","

Your response:
","It sounds like the weight of those expectations is turning into a physical ache, and that’s more than just “busy‑brain” for many people. When a new responsibility lands, the brain’s alarm system can go off—thinking, “What if I mess this up?”—and it can feel like a body‑freeze reaction. You’re not alone; a lot of folks hit that wall when they jump back into law school or a new role. A small shift can help: set a timer for just 5 minutes to draft a short reply, then step away; or outline a single, concrete next step (e.g., “I’ll call the organization at 3 pm”) and write that down. That little act of concrete planning can turn the looming dread into a manageable task. You don’t have to face everything at once—just one small action, and the rest often follows.","

","I hear how frustrating and uncomfortable this must be for you. Teeth grinding and jaw clenching (also called bruxism) are actually very common symptoms of anxiety and stress. You're definitely not alone in experiencing this. It's understandable that you're trying to figure out whether it's related to your medication or anxiety - it could be either, or even a combination of both.

Living with daily anxiety is already challenging enough without adding physical discomfort to the mix. Have you had a chance to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider? They might be able to help determine if your medication is contributing and could suggest some solutions, like a night guard or relaxation techniques specifically for jaw tension.

Would you like to share more about when you notice the clenching happening most? Sometimes being aware of our triggers can be a first step in managing these physical responses to anxiety.","

Your response:
","You're experiencing a very common phenomenon, often referred to as bruxism. It's a habitual behavior that can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or even certain medications, which might be the case with your antidepressants. It's as if your body is trying to cope with the emotional tension by releasing it physically. It's interesting that you mention anxiety every day, and I sense that this grinding or clenching might be a bodily expression of that anxiety.

It might be helpful to explore some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness exercises, to help manage your anxiety and, in turn, alleviate the grinding and clenching. Additionally, you may want to discuss your concerns with your doctor or dentist to see if there are any adjustments that can be made to your medication or if there are any dental solutions that could help.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot on your own—grinding and clenching can feel like a private, almost invisible way your body’s trying to cope with the daily pressure of anxiety. You’re not alone; many people notice this habit only after it’s become routine, and it can sometimes be amplified by medication or the stress of being constantly on edge.

What might help is a gentle, multi‑layer approach:  
- **Mindful awareness:** Set a few alarms a day to pause, notice the tension, and breathe slowly.  
- **Jaw relaxation tools:** A warm compress, gentle massage, or a simple jaw‑stretch exercise can ease the muscle tension.  
- **Professional check‑in:** Discuss the clenching with your prescribing clinician—they can rule out side‑effects or adjust your dose, and they might refer you to a dentist or therapist who specializes in bruxism.

Instead of sending it to hell, consider treating it as a stubborn guest who’s still learning the house rules.

You’re doing the hard work of confronting it; keep that courage on your side.","

Stop haunting me.

jb4pzf,Anxiety,I finally talked to my doctor about anxiety -he told me to try a meditation app.,FacelessOldWoman1234,"I've had anxiety for years and it's been getting worse and worse. Finally I got up the courage to call my doctor. I told him everything, and went through some questionnaires with him.  He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal."" 

I feel really discouraged.

Edit: Thank you for the perspective, advice, and support. I think that those of you who suggested that the doctor is just starting at the bottom of the treatment ladder are correct. I have otherwise had good experiences with this doctor, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I do think however that he could have done better than just suggest I use a different app to do something I already indicated wasn't working. It felt really dismissive, and sent me down a bit of a spiral. I will try again (although I already worry I'll just fail at it and it will be one more failure for the books), and I'll work on my sleep hygiene myself. Again, thank you for the support.",735,242,1602695049,"That sucks, and I can see why you don't feel listened to.

Giving the app a go might not be a bad idea.

You're within your rights to ask for another opinion, from a different doctor. Even if 6 hours of sleep is deemed normal, it is still affecting your wellbeing and should therefore be taken seriously.

You deserve to have your concerns heard and treated as important.",308,meekomania,Any doctor that says 6 hours of sleep a night is enough is not educated enough to hold the title of doctor imo. I would seek a second opinion from a doctor that knows what they are doing,6,pritch_dawg,"It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time, and it's understandable to feel discouraged when you’ve taken a brave step to seek help and the response doesn’t meet your expectations. Your concerns about anxiety and sleep are valid, and it’s important to feel heard and supported in your journey towards better mental health. It’s good to hear that you’ve had positive experiences with your doctor in the past, and giving him the benefit of the doubt could be a constructive approach. However, it’s also essential to advocate for yourself and communicate your needs clearly. Perhaps you can express to your doctor that while you’re willing to try the app, you’re also looking for additional support or alternative strategies. Remember that managing anxiety is often a process of trial and error, and what works can vary from person to person. Be kind to yourself, and acknowledge the courage it takes to address these issues. You're taking important steps forward, and that's something to be proud of.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and discouraged you feel. It took real courage to finally reach out for help with your anxiety, only to feel dismissed with a suggestion you've already tried. That must have been really deflating, especially after building up to this appointment and being so honest about your struggles.

While your doctor may be following a standard treatment protocol starting with non-medication options, they could have done a better job acknowledging your previous efforts and current distress. Six hours of sleep might be technically ""normal,"" but if it's not enough for you to function well, that's what matters.

Please don't give up. You know yourself best, and it's okay to advocate for more support. Consider going back after the month and being very clear about what has and hasn't worked. You might also explore seeing a mental health specialist who can offer more targeted anxiety treatment options. Your struggles are valid, and you deserve support that actually helps.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and somewhat invalidated by your doctor's response. On one hand, it's great that you finally felt brave enough to open up about your anxiety struggles. However, his suggestion to try a meditation app, despite knowing you've had difficulty establishing a mindfulness routine, might have felt dismissive and unsupportive.

It's possible that your doctor is indeed taking a step-by-step approach, as some have suggested, but it's also understandable that you'd want more acknowledgment of the difficulties you're facing. It's not just about using a different app, but about understanding why these methods haven't worked for you in the past. I hear that you're willing to give it another try and work on your sleep hygiene, but I also want to acknowledge the courage it takes to seek help and the vulnerability you've shown.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and discouraged you feel right now. It’s hard when someone we trust tells us to try something we’ve already struggled with, especially after you’ve been honest about the barriers you face. Your anxiety is not a sign of weakness; it’s a signal that you need a different kind of support.

Consider asking for a more concrete plan: maybe a brief CBT‑based app, a short guided session with a therapist, or a sleep‑hygiene checklist you can tick off daily. If the doctor is reluctant to dive deeper, it could help to bring a note or a friend who can advocate for you. Remember, 6 hours isn’t “enough” if you’re not feeling rested—if the quality of sleep is poor, try a 30‑minute wind‑down routine or a relaxation audio before bed.

You deserve care that feels tailored to you, not a one‑size‑fits‑all “try this app” suggestion. Keep pushing—each step, even the small ones, is progress.","

f2ej20,Anxiety,Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,efarley1,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",1227,93,1581453318,YAY!,36,captain_paws_tattoo,Congratulations,15,Jacek310,"Congratulations on passing your driver's test!

It's clear you understand exactly what others might be going through because you've just been there yourself.

Don't downplay this accomplishment - getting your license at 25 is just as valid as getting it at 16. Everyone has their own timeline, and what matters is that you did it when it was right for you. Thank you for sharing your success story and spreading encouragement to others!","

Expert reasoning dialog:

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!  I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!.

Your response:
","It sounds like you've accomplished something truly meaningful to you, and that's something to be incredibly proud of. Passing your driver's test at 25 shows that it's never too late to push through challenges and achieve your goals. Your willingness to share your experience and offer helpful advice to others in similar situations is truly inspiring. It's clear that you're not only celebrating your own success but also paying it forward to support others. Your tips, from practicing with mock tests to being familiar with the car's features, are practical and valuable. Congratulations again on this achievement, and I'm glad to see that you've found a supportive community to share your news with.","

","Congratulations on passing your driver’s test—what an achievement! It’s completely normal to feel that foot‑shaking moment; the nerves you felt show how much you care about doing it right. You turned that anxiety into motivation, practiced until you were ready, and finally proved to yourself that you can do it. Your tips—mock tests, familiarizing with the car, and paying close attention to signs—are gold for anyone else walking the same path. Sharing your experience not only celebrates your success but also gives others a roadmap. Keep that confidence behind the wheel, and remember: every driver once stood where you are now. You’ve earned this milestone, and there’s no doubt you’ll keep mastering the road ahead. 🚗💪","

fyg254,Anxiety,Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?,Skerivo,"My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach. When I become really anxious (for no reason just because), I'll become nauseous (along with other symptoms). Except, while most people are scared of vomiting, I'm petrified. I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop. It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?",961,111,1586526229,"My anxiety is connected to my stomach but I also have IBS so when I get anxious I get nauseous and have mild to severe stomach pains (as well as eating certain foods). If I'm doing something out of my comfort zone I always have to rush to the toilet. 

Throwing up makes me scared but fortunately I take comfort in the fact I haven't thrown up in years",81,DryTeaStain,"I have the same issues. My advice would be to seek help asap. The longer it goes on, the harder it is to end this terrible loop. Any stomach issues or chest pain throw me into horrible panic.",13,rae2176,"It sounds like you're experiencing a challenging cycle with your anxiety and nausea. It's quite common for anxiety to manifest physically, and when it centers around the stomach, it can indeed create a loop where one exacerbates the other. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, and many people with anxiety disorders, like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), experience similar symptoms. Your fear of vomiting, while it might feel irrational to you, is also a recognized concern for many and can be related to a specific phobia known as emetophobia. It's important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and seeking support from a mental health professional can be beneficial. They can help you with strategies to manage your anxiety and break the cycle. Connecting with others who have similar experiences, perhaps in a support group, can also provide comfort and practical tips. Remember, reaching out is a strong first step toward finding relief.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrating and overwhelming this cycle must be for you. It's actually quite common for anxiety to manifest physically in the stomach, and what you're describing - that loop between anxiety and nausea - is something many people experience. The fear of vomiting (emetophobia) is a real condition, even if you haven't been formally diagnosed.

It sounds like you're dealing with multiple challenging conditions (GAD and GERD) that feed into each other, making this cycle particularly difficult to break. You're not being irrational or stupid - phobias and anxiety responses are very real and can be incredibly distressing.

Have you considered talking to a healthcare provider about this specific anxiety-nausea cycle? They might be able to help you develop coping strategies that address both the physical and emotional aspects of what you're experiencing. You're definitely not alone in this struggle, and there are ways to work through it.","

Your response:
","""You're describing a vicious cycle where your anxiety triggers nausea, and the fear of vomiting intensifies your anxiety, creating a loop. It sounds incredibly distressing and paralyzing. It's not uncommon for people with anxiety disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), to experience gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea. The presence of GERD exacerbates the situation, making it even more challenging for you to cope.

Your awareness of this pattern and the potential phobia underlying it is a crucial step. Recognizing the irrationality of your fear doesn't necessarily alleviate it, but it's a starting point for addressing it. It might be helpful to explore relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage your anxiety and reduce the likelihood of nausea. Additionally, considering seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety disorders could provide you with personalized guidance and support.""","

Your response:
","I hear how stuck that loop feels—anxiety sparking nausea, which then fuels more anxiety, and it can feel like a vicious cycle you can’t break. It’s actually pretty common, especially in people with GAD, GERD, or any anxiety disorder; the body’s “fight‑or‑flight” system can over‑activate the gut, and the fear of vomiting can turn into a powerful trigger of its own.

A few things that often help:  
1. **Grounding and breathing** – slow, 4‑2‑6 breathing (inhale 4s, hold 2s, exhale 6s) can calm the nervous system and interrupt the spiral.  
2. **Cognitive reframing** – remind yourself that nausea is a symptom, not a sign of imminent vomiting; write down “I am not going to vomit” and challenge it when it pops up.  
3. **Gradual exposure** – practice short, safe periods of “feeling nauseous” while staying in a calm environment; over time the brain learns it’s not dangerous.  
4. **Medical check‑in**","

","It sounds like you were in a tough spot—trying to power through work, reaching for that quick caffeine lift, only to feel a panic attack instead. I hear you: you’re feeling “trash” right now, even though you played it off at lunch. That mix of disappointment and self‑criticism can be exhausting.

You’re not alone in this. Caffeine can trigger or worsen anxiety in many people, especially when the body is already stressed. The key isn’t to punish yourself but to notice the pattern: when you crave that surge, you’re actually signaling a need for rest, hydration, or a calmer focus. Maybe try a short walk, a breathing exercise, or a low‑caffeine beverage next time. Give yourself credit for noticing the cue and for getting through the day—small wins matter. You’re doing better than you think.","

l6o4gf,Anxiety,"Something my therapist told me that may help someone: ""Mental illness laughs in the face of logic and reason. Please don't torture yourself because your anxiety is off the charts over something 'stupid' or for no reason at all. That's just how your brain works right now. It is OKAY. We can fix it.""",larki18,"I struggle hard with CBT precisely because a lot of the techniques seem to focus on helping me realize my anxiety is illogical - it's like no Shit Sherlock, I knew that. Sometimes you've just got to give yourself a little grace. Your brain is working its ass off trying to protect you in a world full of 'threats'. Life is hard for an anxious brain.",1772,98,1611808697,"The jury is still out on if she *can* fix it and on the usefulness of CBT for me, at least for my GAD - but every now and then something she says brings comfort. Medication has been a lifesaver, therapy is more like ""nice to have"" - very useful for panic disorder and trich, so far pretty useless for GAD so in a way it's a net neutral.",77,larki18,"Yeah, in my experience, therapy was useless for GAD.

And I disagree a tad - IMO a lot of CBT was BS 'positive thinking' (which may be just as unrealistic as negative thibking).",23,x131e,"It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), where the emphasis on logic can feel invalidating when you're already aware of the irrational nature of your anxiety. It's important to remember that acknowledging your anxiety as illogical doesn't mean dismissing your feelings. Your therapist's advice about giving yourself grace is crucial here; it's about recognizing that your brain is in overdrive trying to keep you safe, even if its methods aren't always helpful. 

Consider complementing CBT with other therapeutic approaches that focus on self-compassion and acceptance, like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or mindfulness practices. These can help you develop a kinder relationship with your anxious thoughts, allowing you to observe them without judgment. Remember, every step you take towards understanding and managing your anxiety is progress. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to seek out what truly resonates with you.","

Q: Something my therapist told me that may help someone: ""Mental illness laughs in the face of logic and reason. Please don't torture yourself because your anxiety is off the charts over something 'stupid' or for no reason at all. That's just how your brain works right now. It is OKAY. We can fix it.""  I struggle hard with CBT precisely because a lot of the techniques seem to focus on helping me realize my anxiety is illogical - it's like no Shit Sherlock, I knew that. Sometimes you've just got to give yourself a little grace. Your brain is working its ass off trying to protect you in a world full of 'threats'. Life is hard for an anxious brain..

Your response:
","Thank you for sharing that powerful insight. You make such a valid point about how acknowledging the ""illogical"" nature of anxiety doesn't automatically make it go away. Your brain is indeed trying its best to protect you, even if its alarm system is oversensitive right now. It's like having an overprotective guard dog - its intentions are good, even when its reactions are overblown.

I appreciate how you emphasize self-compassion alongside traditional CBT techniques. Sometimes we need to simply sit with and accept our anxious feelings rather than immediately trying to reason them away. Being gentle with ourselves during these moments isn't giving in to the anxiety - it's recognizing that we're doing our best with the mental tools we currently have.

Your message about giving yourself grace is so important. We wouldn't harshly judge someone else for having an anxiety response, so we deserve to extend that same understanding to ourselves.","

Your response:
","Your therapist's words resonate deeply, don't they? It's as if they're giving you permission to accept that your anxiety isn't something you can simply 'logic' away. It's a reminder that self-compassion is just as crucial as self-awareness in managing anxiety. By acknowledging that your brain is working hard to protect you, you're allowing yourself to be kinder and more understanding of your own struggles. It's not about ignoring the illogical nature of your anxiety, but rather about recognizing that it's a symptom of a brain that's trying to keep you safe. This perspective shift can be incredibly liberating, and it might just be the key to making CBT more effective and sustainable for you.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between two voices: one that wants to dismiss the anxiety as “illogical,” and another that knows the brain is doing its best to keep you safe. That’s a real tension—CBT often frames thoughts as faulty, but for an anxious mind that framing can feel invalidating. Try re‑labeling the “logical” work as a gentle check, not a verdict. Instead of saying “your anxiety is stupid,” you could say, “I notice my brain is alerting me—let’s see what it’s worried about.” Give yourself the grace to feel the anxiety without judgment, then gently explore its roots. It’s OK to pause, breathe, and remind yourself that your brain is doing what it thinks is protective. You’re already taking steps by noticing the conflict—keep that curiosity, but let it be kind.","

Anyone else feels like this?",1168,77,1605883663,"I’ve felt like that for all of high school. Truth is: if you really were annoying, people would tell you, believe me. Or people would avoid you and would not speak to you. 
I used to think like that because I was extremely self conscious due to being bullied for years. I thought no one would like me and I was a burden. 
But I wasn’t. And I’m pretty sure you aren’t as well. 
Ask people you trust about this. It’s scary, but it helps. Ask them if your voice sounds weird and tell them how you feel about wasting their time. I’m sure their answers will calm you down and make you more confident. You can use this to work on yourself and get better.

Sometimes I even say to them to tell me if I am being insensitive or smth. But they never do.

Maybe they think I'm stupid, cause my thoughts wander a lot and I cannot give them a straight answer right away. Or maybe they think I'm borring.

","I hear how much pain and self-doubt you're experiencing in your interactions with others. It sounds incredibly isolating to constantly worry that you're being a burden or annoying people, to the point where you're choosing silence instead. These feelings are actually quite common - many people struggle with similar thoughts of being ""too much"" or unwanted.

But I'm concerned about you asking if ""shutting up"" is worth it. Withdrawing from others might feel safer in the moment, but it can make those anxious feelings even stronger over time. Your voice and your presence have value, even if your mind is telling you otherwise right now.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy weight of self‑doubt that feels like a constant “I’m annoying.” That’s a painful place to be, and it can make every interaction feel like a minefield. You’re not alone—many people wrestle with a fear of being perceived as a nuisance, especially when they’re anxious or self‑critical. The key is to separate the *belief* that you’re annoying from the *reality* that most people are more forgiving than you think. Small, honest steps can help: try a short, simple message that simply says “Hey, how’s your day?” and observe the response—often it’s more neutral than you expect. Remember, you deserve to be heard, and your presence isn’t a burden. You’re worth the effort.","

","Yes, what you're feeling is actually a very common experience with anxiety and panic disorders. I hear the fear and distress in your question, and it's important for you to know you're not alone in this. Many people with severe anxiety report feeling like they're ""going crazy"" or ""losing control"" - it's actually one of the most frequent symptoms of panic attacks.

These feelings, while incredibly frightening, don't mean you're actually losing your mind. Your brain is experiencing an intense stress response, which can make everything feel surreal and overwhelming. It's like your mind's alarm system is stuck in overdrive.

Would you feel comfortable sharing what specific sensations or thoughts make you feel this way? Sometimes just putting these feelings into words can help reduce their power over us. And if these feelings are significantly impacting your daily life, please know that mental health professionals are specifically trained to help people navigate through these exact challenges.","

","It’s not uncommon to feel like your thoughts are spiraling when anxiety and panic hit hard. Many people describe that sense of “losing control” or even “going insane,” and it’s usually a sign that the nervous system is overwhelmed, not that you’re actually losing your mind. Remember that these sensations are part of the body’s fight‑or‑flight response—your brain is trying to protect you, even if it feels scary.

You’re not alone, and it can help to:

1. **Pause and breathe** – a 4‑7‑8 inhale‑exhale pattern can reset the nervous system.  
2. **Ground yourself** – touch something solid, name five things you see, four you can touch, etc.  
3. **Write it down** – noting triggers or patterns can reduce the feeling of chaos.

Acknowledge the embarrassment, but also remind yourself that you’ve grown since then and that those moments don't define who you are now. Sometimes, it can help to talk about these feelings with someone you trust or write them down to process them better. With time, these feelings of embarrassment can diminish, and you might even find humor in them. Be kind to yourself and recognize the progress you've made since those moments.","

Your response:
","I hear you, and those intense waves of embarrassment and self-criticism sound really overwhelming. It's actually a very common human experience - our brains seem wired to replay these moments, even years later. The physical urge to hide or punch yourself shows just how visceral these memories feel, even though they're from the past. While it might not feel like it in those moments, the fact that you cringe at past actions often means you've grown and learned since then. Would you feel comfortable sharing what helps you cope when these memories hit? Sometimes just knowing we're not alone in experiencing these feelings can make them a bit more bearable.","

Would you say that these flashbacks are triggered by anything in particular, or do they seem to come out of the blue?","

Your response:
","It sounds exhausting to have those old “cringe” moments keep popping up with such intensity. It’s actually more common than you think—our brains sometimes latch on to embarrassing memories because they’re vivid or tied to strong emotions. The key is to shift how you respond to them rather than trying to suppress the memories themselves.

1. **Grounding**: When the wave hits, focus on something tangible—feel your feet on the floor, notice a texture, or name five things you can see. This pulls you back to the present.  
2. **Reframe the story**: Remind yourself you’re a human who makes mistakes, and those moments don’t define you.  
3. **Self‑compassion**: Treat yourself like you would treat a friend in the same situation—offer kindness, not self‑punishment.  
4. **Journaling**: Write a quick note about the memory and then write a counter‑statement that highlights growth or humor.  
5. **Professional support**: If the anxiety feels","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: Anyone else get random cringe flashbacks?  I keep getting overwhelmed with thoughts of embarrassing things I did like 5 years ago.

It might help to break down the situation into smaller, more manageable parts. Consider what specifically about the phone call is causing you anxiety. Once you identify the core concerns, you might find it easier to address them. Meanwhile, try to practice grounding techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, to help bring your focus back to the present.

Your response:
","I hear how frustrating and isolating that anxiety can be - where even small future tasks can cast such a large shadow over your present moments. It's particularly challenging when it's something as brief as a 2-minute call, yet it has the power to steal joy from your days leading up to it. But you know what? The fact that over 1,500 people related to your experience shows you're far from alone in this struggle. Many of us know exactly what it's like to have anxiety hijack our ability to enjoy the present. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to acknowledge how difficult this is while also recognizing you're part of a larger community who understands.

","It sounds like you're experiencing the weight of anticipatory anxiety, where a small future task looms large in your mind and overshadows the present moment. This is completely understandable, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact it has on your daily life.

It's interesting that you mention feeling alone, yet also having a large following that relates to you. This paradox highlights the complex nature of anxiety, where even with a strong support system, it's possible to feel isolated and overwhelmed by your thoughts. It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles, and the fact that many people resonate with you suggests that you're not alone in this feeling. Would you like to explore ways to cope with anticipatory anxiety and perhaps find more joy in the present moment?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a place where the excitement of the day feels dimmed by a little future worry. That 2‑minute call in five days is probably weighing on you because you’re not sure how it will go or how you’ll feel afterward. It’s normal to feel a mix of anticipation and anxiety, and you’re not alone—many people experience the same tug‑of‑war between present joy and future stress.

Try a quick grounding trick: pause, breathe in for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four, and notice the present. Then, set a small “call‑prep” task for tomorrow—write down the points you want to cover. Knowing you’ve already taken a step can ease the anxiety and let you savor today a bit more. You’ve got this.","

It's completely normal to feel this way - many people experience similar anxiety, especially after longer breaks.

What you're describing sounds like ""re-entry anxiety"" - that surge of stress when returning to our regular routines. It's often tied to worrying about pending tasks, readjusting to work dynamics, or simply the stark contrast between relaxation time and work demands.

I sense you're looking for validation and connection around these feelings, and it's wonderful that you reached out.

Your response:
","I hear how deeply you feel others' emotions and struggles, to the point where it becomes overwhelming for you. It's actually quite common for highly empathetic people to experience anxiety from absorbing so much of others' pain and loneliness. The fact that you were worried about being judged for expressing this shows how sensitive you are to others' perspectives.

While this level of empathy is a beautiful human quality, it's important to remember that you don't have to carry everyone's burdens. It's okay to feel deeply for others while also maintaining healthy emotional boundaries to protect your own wellbeing. The relief you feel in discovering others who share this experience suggests you've been carrying this weight alone for some time.

Consider that your empathy is a strength, not a weakness - it just needs to be balanced with self-care and the understanding that you can care deeply without taking on everyone's pain.","

","It's great to hear that you're feeling less alone in this experience. Yes, excessive empathy can indeed lead to anxiety. This is often referred to as 'compassion fatigue' or 'empathy fatigue.' When we deeply connect with the emotions of others, it can be overwhelming and draining. 

It sounds like you're naturally inclined to care deeply about others, which can be both a blessing and a challenge. Recognizing that you're not alone in this feeling is a big step.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of unasked‑for weight. Feeling deep concern for strangers or even fleeting moments can become a source of anxiety when you’re left alone with the emotions you’re soaking up. You’re not alone—many people experience “empathy fatigue” or “compassion stress,” where well‑intentioned caring turns into a mental drain.

A useful trick is to set gentle boundaries: notice when a feeling starts to feel overwhelming, give yourself permission to pause, and practice a quick grounding or self‑compassion check. Remind yourself that caring for others doesn’t require you to rescue every situation; it’s okay to be a compassionate observer and then step back.

Your response:
","It’s actually **very common**—a good chunk of people do read the anxiety subreddit without posting or commenting. Many of us prefer to start as observers, especially when we’re first feeling the weight of anxiety or just want to see how others share and cope. It’s a perfectly valid way to engage, and you’re already taking a step forward by joining the community.

Progress isn’t measured by the number of posts you make; it’s about the fact that you’re giving yourself permission to be present, to listen, and to slowly decide when you’re ready to share. If you feel up to it, try leaving a short comment in something that resonates—no pressure. You’re not alone, and every voice we hear, even the silent ones, adds to the support we all need.","

","I hear the concern and frustration in your message about health anxiety. It's true that falling into the rabbit hole of medical websites can create a vicious cycle of worry and fear. It sounds like you might have experienced this yourself or seen others struggle with it. While wanting to understand our health is natural, obsessively searching symptoms often leads to more distress than answers.

I appreciate that you're not just pointing out the problem, but also offering constructive alternatives like speaking with healthcare professionals. That's a much healthier approach than letting our minds spiral with worst-case scenarios we find online. Sometimes we need that gentle reminder to step away from the endless scrolling and seek proper medical guidance instead.

Would you say your message comes from personal experience with health anxiety? Many people struggle with this, and it's brave to acknowledge the pattern and try to break it.","

Your response:
","I hear how exhausting it can feel to keep chasing answers online, especially when every site seems to magnify the worst‑case scenario. It’s understandable—you’re looking for reassurance and it feels like the only way to stay in control. The trick is to shift some of that control into more grounded steps that actually help, not just add to the anxiety.

1. **Set a “research window.”** Pick a short, fixed time (say 10–15 minutes) to look up symptoms, then stop.  
2. **Log what you see.** Write a brief list of your main concerns and any red‑flag symptoms.  
3. **Share it with a professional.** A quick telehealth call can provide a quick reassurance or a plan, and you’ll have a concrete next step.  
4. **Practice grounding.** When you feel the panic spike, try a 4‑7‑8 breathing pattern or a short walk.

It's common to fantasize about escaping to a simpler life when faced with uncertainty or dissatisfaction. These feelings might be your mind’s way of signaling that something needs to shift in your life. You mentioned that you recognize the cycle you're in and your desire for a different reality. This self-awareness is a crucial first step toward change.

Consider exploring what specific aspects of life in a log cabin or a different reality appeal to you. Is it the solitude, the simplicity, or the chance to start anew? Identifying these elements might help you incorporate similar changes into your current life.

It's also important to take small, actionable steps towards finding fulfillment. This might involve exploring new hobbies, seeking support from friends or professionals, or setting small, achievable goals to reignite motivation. Remember, it’s okay to seek help when you’re feeling stuck—talking to a mental health professional can provide guidance and support as you navigate these feelings.

Your response:
","I hear how deeply you're struggling with feeling unfulfilled and stuck in a cycle that feels meaningless. The desire to escape to a cabin isn't just about running away - it seems to represent a deeper yearning for purpose and authenticity in your life. It's telling that even in your lowest moments, part of you is still protecting yourself and holding onto hope for something better.

The exhaustion you describe of seeing problems coming but lacking the energy to act sounds really draining. Yet I notice you're quite self-aware - you understand these patterns and even recognize that your mind is still looking out for your wellbeing, even if you can't always feel it consciously.

While the escape fantasy provides temporary relief, I wonder if it might be worth exploring what specifically about that simpler life appeals to you? Sometimes our daydreams can give us clues about what we're really seeking. Have you considered talking to a counselor who could help you unpack these feelings and gradually build a sense of purpose that feels authentic to you?","

I sense that beneath your desire to leave everything behind, there's a deep longing for fulfillment and a sense of excitement about life. You mention feeling unfulfilled since you were a kid, which suggests that this is a deeply ingrained feeling for you.

It's interesting that you mention your mind won't let you get addicted to substance abuse, even though it's become a way for you to cope with your emotions. This suggests that, despite feeling lost, there's still a part of you that's holding onto hope for a better future.

","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy, restless ache—an urge to escape that feels both protective and hopeful. That “log‑cabin” fantasy is a signal that you’re craving space to breathe, to reset, to see yourself without the weight of your current routine. It’s not a sign of failure; it’s a compass pointing to what feels missing.

Start by carving out a tiny ritual that lets you check in with what truly matters to you, even if it’s just a 10‑minute walk, a short journal entry, or a mind‑map of three things you love. When the urge to flee hits, pause for one breath, note that feeling, and ask yourself: “What tiny action could make this moment less chaotic?” Over time, those small, purposeful moves can stitch a new narrative that feels less like a cycle and more like a path you’re co‑creating.

If the fog feels too dense, consider talking to a counselor or therapist—they’re trained to help untangle these layers and bring clarity without judgment. You’re not alone in this; many find that the most radical change starts with the smallest step.","

A gentle way to break it is to pause the judgment. Notice the anxious thoughts, label them “just thoughts,” and practice a brief grounding exercise (e.g., 5‑4‑3‑2‑1). Small, non‑threatening steps—like setting a timer for 3 minutes of breathing or journaling a single sentence—can interrupt the spiral.

My heart races and there is this constant pit in my stomach. I usually try to make up some stories in my mind. Like worldbuilding, etc. It calms me down. Or sometimes, I sleep while The Office runs in the background.",40,pearl_sparkle,"It sounds like you're going through a challenging time, and you're certainly not alone in experiencing physical symptoms from anxiety. Many people find that their bodies can hold onto stress long after the initial trigger has passed, which can lead to things like a racing heart, especially if caffeine is in the mix. It's great to hear that so many others have reached out to share their experiences and support, which can be comforting in itself. While caffeine can sometimes exacerbate anxiety symptoms, being aware of this relationship is a positive step toward managing it in the future. Meanwhile, consider trying some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or gentle stretching, to help calm your mind and body. Remember, reaching out for support from friends, family, or professionals can also be incredibly beneficial. Take care of yourself, and know that it's okay to ask for help when you need it.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrating and uncomfortable this must be for you, especially when you're trying to rest. It's completely normal for anxiety to have lingering physical effects like a racing heart, and the caffeine likely intensified those sensations. You're definitely not alone in this experience - many people deal with the physical aftermath of anxiety long after the initial trigger has passed.

It sounds like you're aware of what contributed to these feelings (the earlier anxiety episode and caffeine), which shows good self-awareness. While it may not help much right now, recognizing these patterns is an important first step in managing anxiety's physical symptoms.

Would you like to share more about what helped trigger the anxiety earlier? Sometimes talking about it can help process those feelings and potentially reduce some of the physical tension you're experiencing.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're experiencing a lingering physiological response to anxiety, often referred to as ""anxiety hangover."" This is a common phenomenon where the body takes time to recover from the stress response triggered by anxiety. The caffeine consumption likely didn't help, as it can prolong the effects of anxiety and make it harder to wind down.

It's great to see that you're acknowledging your body's response and seeking support. Recognizing the connection between your anxiety and physical symptoms is a significant step in managing your anxiety. Consider exploring relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, to help calm your body and mind.","

","It’s more common than you think—when anxiety spikes, the body can stay on high‑alert for hours, especially with caffeine on board. A racing heart, sweaty palms, and an overactive mind can keep you from drifting into sleep. Try a simple grounding routine: slow, deep breaths (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6), then mentally list five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. If caffeine is still in your system, consider a short walk or gentle stretching to use up the excess energy. A warm glass of water with a splash of lemon can also help calm the gut.

This is one of my top 5 anxiety triggers. I've found that by thinking too far ahead like this, I speed up time and am almost always getting to that point quicker the more I think about it. So I think about/plan for the short term. I kind of force myself to ""comfortably"" think about tomorrow on a small scale. Like what I might eat for breakfast, what outfit I might wear, what I'll be working on at work. Small things that put me more closer to the now that I can control most of the time.",278,40ozFreed,"I just use Gandalf as a role model and imagine that as I get older I'll obtain more esoteric wisdom and picture myself in the library of my future house surrounded by books, maps, and items from my travels, with age churning me like a fine cheese into sophistication.",104,blankmarks,"It's completely natural to feel anxious about aging. Many people share similar concerns, as growing older brings about changes and uncertainties. It's important to remember that while we can't stop the aging process, we can focus on living a fulfilling life in the present. Embrace the experiences and wisdom that come with age. Finding ways to care for your mental and physical well-being can help ease these anxieties. Consider engaging in activities that bring you joy, fostering strong relationships, and practicing mindfulness to stay grounded. It's okay to feel apprehensive, but try to focus on the things you can control and cherish each moment.","

","I hear how deeply this existential worry about aging affects you. It's completely natural to feel anxious about something so universal yet personally challenging. Many people struggle with accepting the reality of aging and mortality - you're definitely not alone in these feelings.

Your response:
","It’s completely normal to feel that knot of anxiety when we start thinking about the years ahead. The fact that you’re aware of the reality—“there’s nothing we can do about it”—yet still can’t shake the worry speaks to how deeply we’re invested in the idea of time and our place in it. You’re not alone; many people wrestle with that same tension between acceptance and the fear of losing what we’ve built. One gentle way to ease that tension is to focus on what we can shape right now—our habits, our relationships, the moments we choose to savor. It might help to reframe aging as a series of chapters, each with its own opportunities, rather than a single, inevitable ending. If the anxiety feels overwhelming, talking it out with a trusted friend, therapist, or support group can bring relief and remind you that we’re all navigating these questions together.","

rjoobk,Anxiety,I’m graduating from my masters program and no one cares,ladymemedaddy,"So I’m graduating with my Masters at the end of December, but I finish classes in a few days. I also graduated college class of 2020 and spent my graduating sitting on my couch crying because I was so sad. I decided to try to let it go, since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn’t. Now, it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I’m happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn’t been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can’t even do that, and I don’t want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven’t been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don’t know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there’s nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it’s causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Edit: I am blown away by the kindness of strangers who don’t even know me, but took the time to write something nice. Sending all of you virtual hugs❤️ I am so appreciative of all your kind words

Edit 2: WOW! Thank you all so much for your comments! I spent the past 2 days crying with horrible anxiety, but waking up seeing all your comments and kindness really turned my day around. I wanted to take the time to respond to everyone individually since you were all kind enough comment. If I happened to miss your comment, I apologize, but I am so grateful and appreciative of every single one of you❤️",739,216,1639887604,"I did a master’s program as a full time employee and parent. I was so frazzled at the end of two years I couldn’t sleep a full night anymore. So, as a person who’s been there, congratulations. It’s a great achievement. Also, don’t compare yourself to others, it robs you of happiness. I only say as a reminder to myself because it took me most of my life to figure it out.",182,NetwerkErrer,CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!,20,mmurry,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of mixed emotions right now, which is completely understandable given the circumstances. Graduating with a master's degree is a significant achievement, and it's natural to want recognition and celebration for all the hard work you've put in. It's unfortunate that your graduation is coinciding with your sister's wedding, which seems to be drawing the focus away from your accomplishments. 

It's important to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself permission to feel them without judgment. It might be helpful to have a candid conversation with your family about how you're feeling. They may not realize the impact their focus on the wedding is having on you. Additionally, consider creating your own celebration, even if it's a small, personal acknowledgment of your success with close friends or family who can safely join you.

Remember, your achievements are valid and worth celebrating. You deserve to be proud of yourself, and it's okay to seek support from friends or even online communities who can share in your joy. Sending you virtual hugs and congratulations on your incredible accomplishment!","

I’m happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn’t been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can’t even do that, and I don’t want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven’t been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don’t know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there’s nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it’s causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Edit: I am blown away by the kindness of strangers who don’t even know me, but took the time to write something nice. Sending all of you virtual hugs❤️ I am so appreciative of all your kind words

Edit 2: WOW! Thank you all so much for your comments! I spent the past 2 days crying with horrible anxiety, but waking up seeing all your comments and kindness really turned my day around. I wanted to take the time to respond to everyone individually since you were all kind enough comment. If I happened to miss your comment, I apologize, but I am so grateful and appreciative of every single one of you❤️.

Your response:
","I hear how deeply disappointing and painful this situation is for you. Completing a Master's degree is an incredible achievement that deserves to be celebrated, and it's completely understandable to feel hurt when this milestone isn't getting the recognition it deserves. It seems like there's a complex mix of emotions here - pride in your accomplishment, disappointment in the lack of acknowledgment, and perhaps some complicated feelings about your sister's wedding timing.

Your feelings are valid. This isn't just about the graduation ceremony - it's about wanting your hard work and achievement to be seen and celebrated by those you care about. While the timing with your sister's wedding and COVID complications is unfortunate, that doesn't diminish what you've accomplished.

Perhaps you could plan a separate celebration for yourself later, when timing is better? You've earned this moment, and you deserve to celebrate it in a way that feels meaningful to you, even if it's not exactly when or how you initially imagined it.

Would you like to talk more about how you envision celebrating this achievement in a way that would feel special to you?","

Your response:
","I can sense the deep disappointment and sadness you're feeling, and it's completely understandable. It's as if your hard-earned accomplishment is being overshadowed by another event, leaving you feeling unseen and unappreciated. It's not just about the graduation itself, but the feeling of validation and recognition that comes with it. 

It's beautiful that you're happy for your sister, but it's also okay to acknowledge your own feelings and desires. It's not selfish to want to be celebrated and acknowledged for your achievement. It's a huge milestone, and you should be proud of yourself. 

I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it's not just about your family's response. Your accomplishment is worth recognizing, and I'm here to acknowledge it. Congratulations on your Master's degree! You've worked hard for it, and you deserve to be celebrated.","

","I hear how heavy this feels—like a milestone that’s being quietly pushed aside while everyone else’s celebration fills the room. It’s natural to feel overlooked when your own hard work is suddenly eclipsed by a sibling’s wedding, especially after you’ve already dealt with a quiet graduation before. Knowing that you’re still the one who earned this degree, you deserve to feel proud and celebrated. 

Maybe set a small, personal ritual: write a congratulatory note to yourself, share a photo of your diploma on social media, or plan a quiet toast with a close friend who can’t attend the wedding. If possible, tell your parents how important this is to you; their words of acknowledgement can make a big difference. Above all, remember that your achievement is real and significant—no one else’s agenda can diminish that. ❤️","

gkttro,Anxiety,Does anyone else’s anxiety cause abdominal issues?,SensitiveBorder2,"After moving a year and a half ago I started having bouts of severe abdominal cramping followed with...lets just say it sped things up. This has happened once or twice a month for 17 months now and I never had prior issues. My doc thinks it’s just irritable bowel (a really common thing especially with anxiety) I’m worried about something like Crohn’s disease with how bad the cramping can get. All my bloods were normal except low B12 implying some level of malabsorption.

Still I’m just curious if anyone with anxiety like me has had GI upset from it often, I never had issues before but obviously moving was quite a jump and stressful time.

EDIT: I was tested for Celiac, since my father had it they actually checked for the gene and I do not carry it. So that’s ruled out 99.9%",737,173,1589631910,Yes. From my understands it’s a fairly common anxiety symptom. I often get an upset stomach on anxious days.,129,[deleted],"Yes, and I have Crohn’s too. For me, I can feel the difference between the anxiety cramps and then the rush it causes, and a Crohns flare up or the standard Crohns pain. The burning cramping feeling for me is always anxiety related and an IBS issue, whereas for me, Crohns feels like my intestines are trying to digest glass. But if you feel like something really isn’t right, then ask for a second opinion. I was misdiagnosed for 5 years before I got the correct diagnosis and treatment!",1,preachitpickle,"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty and discomfort, and it's understandable to feel anxious about your symptoms. Anxiety can indeed manifest physically, and gastrointestinal issues are a common expression of stress and anxiety. It's reassuring that your doctor has ruled out some conditions like Celiac disease, and normal blood tests are generally a good sign, although your low B12 could warrant further investigation.

It's not uncommon for major life changes, such as moving, to trigger or exacerbate anxiety-related symptoms. You might find it helpful to explore stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or therapy, which can sometimes alleviate both anxiety and its physical manifestations. Additionally, keeping a symptom diary might help you and your doctor identify any patterns or triggers.

However, it's important to continue working with your healthcare provider to monitor your symptoms and rule out other conditions like Crohn's disease. Don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if you feel it's necessary. Your health and peace of mind are important, and you're not alone in this experience.","

","I hear your concern about these painful symptoms, and it's completely understandable to worry about serious conditions like Crohn's. The connection between anxiety and gut health is actually very well-documented - it's often called the ""gut-brain axis."" Many people with anxiety experience similar symptoms to what you're describing, including cramping and digestive issues.

It's positive that you've already had medical tests done and are working with your doctor. The fact that most of your bloodwork came back normal is reassuring, though the B12 issue is worth monitoring. While your symptoms sound very challenging, they do align with what many anxiety sufferers experience, especially following a major life stressor like moving.

That said, if you're still worried, it's perfectly okay to seek a second opinion or ask your doctor about additional testing for peace of mind. Your symptoms are real, regardless of whether they're anxiety-driven or not, and you deserve to feel confident in your diagnosis and treatment plan.","

","It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of distress due to your abdominal issues, and the uncertainty surrounding their cause is only adding to your anxiety. I want to acknowledge that your symptoms are very real and can be extremely debilitating. 

It's not uncommon for anxiety to manifest physically, particularly in the gastrointestinal system. The gut and the brain are closely connected through the gut-brain axis, which can lead to a bidirectional relationship between anxiety and gastrointestinal symptoms. 

Many people with anxiety experience gastrointestinal issues, including abdominal cramping, changes in bowel movements, and malabsorption. The low B12 levels you mentioned could be a sign of malabsorption, which might be related to your anxiety and stress levels. 

While it's great that you've ruled out Celiac disease, it's essential to continue working with your doctor to explore other possible causes and develop a treatment plan that addresses both your physical and emotional symptoms. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about coping with your anxiety, as this might also help alleviate your gastrointestinal issues?","

Your response:
","I hear how unsettling these recurring cramps are, especially with the fear of something more serious. It’s pretty common for anxiety to amplify gut sensations—stress can tighten the gut, alter motility, and even affect absorption, which might explain the low B12. IBS is indeed a frequent diagnosis in anxious individuals, and the fact that your blood work (apart from B12) and celiac testing came back clear is reassuring, though it doesn’t rule out all functional GI disorders.

A few steps might help you feel more in control:

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Does anyone else’s anxiety cause abdominal issues?  After moving a year and a half ago I started having bouts of severe abdominal cramping followed with...lets just say it sped things up. This has happened once or twice a month for 17 months now and I never had prior issues. My doc thinks it’s just irritable bowel (a really common thing especially with anxiety) I’m worried about something like Crohn’s disease with how bad the cramping can get. All my bloods were normal except low B12 implying some level of malabsorption.

Still I’m just curious if anyone with anxiety like me has had GI upset from it often, I never had issues before but obviously moving was quite a jump and stressful time.

EDIT: I was tested for Celiac, since my father had it they actually checked for the gene and I do not carry it. So that’s ruled out 99.9%.

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous.

I think it's related to social anxiety and that intense feeling of being judged by everyone....being hyperaware in social settings.,138,[deleted],"Lol why do you care about teenagers? They are still experiencing life and don’t know what’s going on. 

At my undergrad, people would laugh at me bc they knew I was a lesbian. No joke, it was so stupid. I knew this bc some people would whisper and think I couldn’t hear them. I didn’t give a shit bc it meant they’re just immature and not yet fit for a society of diverse people. ",-3,RobynHood-,"It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially given your past experiences with bullying. You're not alone in this; many people who have been through similar situations develop a heightened sensitivity to laughter or comments around them, fearing that they might be the target. It's not ridiculous—it’s a learned response to protect yourself from past hurt. 

Acknowledging these feelings is a significant first step. It might be helpful to remind yourself that strangers laughing near you are likely focused on their own conversations, not you. Over time, with practice and patience, many people find they can gradually change this perspective. 

Building self-confidence and surrounding yourself with supportive people can also make a big difference. Consider speaking with a therapist if these feelings become overwhelming; they can offer strategies to help you feel more secure and at ease. Remember, you're doing your best, and that's something to be proud of.","

Your response:
","I hear how deeply those years of bullying have affected you, and it's completely understandable that you've developed this protective instinct to be on guard. Many people who've experienced prolonged bullying develop similar hypervigilance - it was literally your brain's way of trying to keep you safe during those difficult years.

The fact that you're more comfortable in groups but struggle when alone suggests that this is more about feeling vulnerable than any real threat. That's a very normal response to past trauma, and it doesn't make you ridiculous at all, even at 25.

While these feelings may be frustrating, they're actually a sign that your mind is still working to protect you, even if it's being a bit overprotective now. Many people do find that these reactions lessen with time and support, whether through therapy, building confidence in other areas of life, or gradually exposing themselves to similar situations in safe ways.

Would you be interested in hearing about some strategies others have found helpful for managing these feelings?","

Your response:
","It sounds like the experience of being bullied for so long has left a lasting impact on you, making you more aware of your surroundings and more prone to assume people are laughing at you. That's not ridiculous at all, considering the length of time you had to endure it.

It's understandable that you'd feel more anxious when you're alone, as opposed to being in a group where you might feel more supported. The association with groups of teenagers, in particular, is also not surprising, given that's likely the demographic that bullied you in the past.

As for overcoming it, it's different for everyone. However, acknowledging the root cause and recognizing the patterns in your thoughts are huge steps forward. You might consider practicing self-compassion and reminding yourself that the laughter is often unrelated to you. It may also be helpful to engage in activities that help you build confidence and challenge these negative thoughts.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re still carrying the echo of those past bullying moments, and that’s completely understandable. When someone laughs nearby, the brain—especially one that’s been on high alert for years—can quickly default to “maybe they’re laughing at me.” That reaction is a protective rhythm, not a sign of weakness.

What helps most is gentle reframing: notice the laugh, pause, and ask yourself, “Is it really directed at me, or is it just a normal reaction to something else?” Pair that with a quick grounding cue—a breath, a physical sensation, or a small mantra like “I’m safe.” Over time, those moments become less automatic. It isn’t “ridiculous”; it’s a common after‑effect of sustained teasing. Many people find that with practice, the fear fades, and they can enjoy group moments without that underlying dread. If you’re open to it, a therapist or support group that focuses on bullying recovery can amplify those coping tools. You’re not alone, and you can reclaim those laughs as just laughs.","

gqmycs,Anxiety,Does anyone else have intense fear that they’ll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,hocrm,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

Many people feel overwhelmed by the responsibilities that come with growing up, and it's okay to feel scared. It's important to remember that becoming independent is a gradual process, and you don't have to have everything figured out overnight. Start by taking small steps towards independence, like learning one new skill at a time. Perhaps you could start by learning how to handle a small task on your own, like making a simple purchase or paying a small bill. 

It's also helpful to talk to someone you trust about your feelings, whether it's a family member, friend, or counselor. They can offer support and guidance as you navigate these changes.

Your response:
","I hear how overwhelming and scary these feelings are for you. It's completely normal to feel anxious about growing up and becoming independent, especially given everything you've been through with the pandemic putting your plans on hold. Your deep love and concern for your family really shows through in how protective you are of them.

What stands out is that you're aware of these fears and actively thinking about them - that's actually a really important first step. Independence doesn't have to happen all at once. You can take small steps, like learning one life skill at a time, while still having your family's support. Many people your age feel similarly overwhelmed about becoming independent.

Would you consider starting with just one small thing that makes you anxious, like paying for something at a shop, and practicing that with your mom nearby for support? This way you can build confidence gradually while still having your safety net. Remember that being independent doesn't mean being alone - it means building your own capabilities while maintaining those important family connections.

Would you like to talk about what one small step might feel manageable to try first?","

Your response:
","I can sense the depth of your fear and anxiety as you're facing the prospect of growing up and becoming independent. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about taking on new responsibilities, especially given the significant role your family has played in your life so far.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that your fears and concerns are valid, and it's not uncommon for people to feel this way, especially when they've been closely tied to their family. It's great that you're recognizing your desire to be your own person, but also acknowledging the anxiety that comes with it.

I'd like to suggest that you start small, by taking on tiny tasks that make you feel more independent. For example, try walking around your neighborhood on your own, or paying for small purchases without your mom's help. As you build confidence in these small tasks, you can gradually move on to more significant responsibilities.

It's also essential to remember that becoming independent doesn't mean you're alone or cut off from your family. You can still maintain close relationships with them while developing your own skills and autonomy. It might be helpful to have open conversations with your family about your fears and concerns, as they may be able to offer valuable support and guidance.

Lastly, I want to reassure you that it's okay to take your time and learn at your own pace. You don't have to become independent overnight, and it's perfectly fine to ask for help when you need it. Remember, becoming your own person","

Your response:
","I hear how heavy this fear feels—like each step toward adulthood is a leap into a void. It’s normal to feel uneasy when the world’s still learning to speak your language, especially when you’ve spent so long in the safety of family. Small, manageable goals can make independence feel less like a cliff and more like a staircase. Start with one “self‑service” task a week: maybe pay a small bill online, or drive a short, familiar route while a family member is in the passenger seat. Celebrate each win, no matter how tiny. Ask a therapist or counselor to unpack the anxiety that turns caring into a paralyzing need to prevent loss; they can help you build a realistic plan for future caregiving. Remember, independence doesn’t mean isolation—building a supportive network, even outside the home, can ease the transition. You’re not alone; many people share this anxious threshold, and with small steps, you can move toward a life that feels both yours and secure.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Does anyone else have intense fear that they’ll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.  im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way &lt;3 )*.

I don’t feel very anxious but I’m absolutely drained and I have headaches and dizziness &amp; this overwhelming exhaustion. It’s very draining.,224,Jamessmith199478,"It's understandable to feel concerned about physical symptoms of anxiety, especially when you can't pinpoint a specific cause. Anxiety can indeed manifest in physical ways, even if you're not consciously aware of feeling anxious. Health anxiety can exacerbate these feelings, as focusing on symptoms often intensifies them. You're not alone in experiencing random heart palpitations, the need for deep breaths, or a lack of motivation—many people report similar symptoms when dealing with anxiety.

While waiting for your appointment, consider some strategies that might help alleviate these symptoms. Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or yoga, can sometimes help ground you and reduce anxiety. Breathing exercises are also beneficial for calming the nervous system. If your symptoms worsen or you feel particularly distressed, seeking support from a mental health professional or a hotline might provide additional comfort.

Remember, it's important to take your feelings seriously, and reaching out to your doctor was a responsible step. You're doing your best to manage a challenging situation, and that’s commendable.","

Your response:
","I hear how confusing and frustrating this must be, experiencing physical anxiety symptoms without a clear mental trigger. It's actually quite common - our bodies can react to stress even when our conscious minds aren't aware of it. And you've highlighted something important: having health anxiety can create a challenging cycle where focusing on the symptoms makes them feel more intense.

The symptoms you're describing - heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, and low motivation - are all classic anxiety manifestations. The fact that you've experienced similar feelings during previous periods of anxiety suggests this might be anxiety presenting itself in a slightly different way than you're used to.

It's good that you've reached out to your doctor to get checked. While waiting for your appointment, try to remember that sometimes anxiety can build up gradually from small stressors we don't consciously register. Maybe there are subtle things causing more stress than you realize?

Remember, you're not alone in this experience - many people go through similar episodes where their body seems to be reacting to something their mind hasn't quite processed yet.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of physical symptoms that are typically associated with anxiety, but you're not aware of any specific mental triggers. This can be unsettling and confusing, especially with a history of health anxiety.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your body can respond to stress and anxiety without your conscious awareness. Sometimes, our bodies can react to internal or external stimuli before our minds catch up. It's also possible that you're experiencing a physical manifestation of underlying anxiety or tension that isn't directly related to a specific issue.

Regarding your symptoms, heat palpitations, the need for deep breathing, and a lack of motivation are all common physical responses to anxiety. It's great that you've reached out to your doctor, and it's essential to follow up on that appointment to rule out any underlying medical conditions.

In the meantime, try to focus on self-care and relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation. These can help calm your body and mind, reducing the physical symptoms you're experiencing. Keep in mind that health anxiety can sometimes exacerbate physical symptoms, so it's essential to address this aspect as well.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught in a loop of “I don’t know why I’m feeling this way, but I’m sure it’s not something I’m consciously worried about.” That tension can itself be enough to trigger the symptoms you’re describing. Even when we’re not actively thinking about a specific threat, the body can still swing into a heightened state—heart palpitations, heat, shallow breathing—especially at night when our minds are less busy.

You’re not alone; many people notice these “random” bursts of anxiety that seem to appear out of nowhere. A useful step is to keep a quick log: note the time, your activity, any subtle triggers (like a noisy phone, a change in routine, or even a small change in posture). This can help you see patterns that aren’t obvious in the moment.

In the meantime, try grounding exercises—counting backwards from 100, focusing on the feel of your feet on the floor, or a brief 5‑minute body scan. These can reduce the immediate surge of physical arousal and might help you feel a bit more in control while","

","I'll be honest - talking to yourself is completely normal and incredibly common! It's actually a healthy way to process thoughts, solve problems, and regulate emotions. Many people have internal dialogues or even speak out loud to themselves while doing tasks, working through decisions, or dealing with feelings. 

What's interesting is that self-talk can be really beneficial - psychologists have found it helps with focus, memory, and emotional regulation. It's like having a built-in sounding board for your thoughts. Sometimes we need to hear things out loud to make sense of them, even if we're the only ones listening.

So if you catch yourself chatting with yourself, don't worry about it! You're in good company with millions of others who do the same thing. Just maybe be mindful of the volume if you're in public spaces! 😉","

","I think it's more common than people admit. Talking to oneself is actually a normal and even beneficial cognitive process. It's a way to process thoughts, work through problems, and even provide self-encouragement. Research suggests that self-talk can be linked to improved performance, motivation, and stress management.

It's also interesting to note that people who talk to themselves are often more introspective and self-aware, which can be a sign of emotional intelligence.

f1t9o0,Anxiety,"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.",ladythescottishplay,"I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety.

It's understandable to feel the way you do, especially when society often places such high demands on us to remain strong and composed. It's important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and that it's okay to want to retreat and recharge. Even though there's a lot on your plate, remember that it's crucial to prioritize your mental health. Your desire for a world where mental health is recognized as important as physical health is shared by many. It’s wonderful to hear that you have a supportive partner, and leaning on them, even just to talk about how you're feeling, can be beneficial. Consider speaking to a mental health professional who can offer strategies to manage these feelings. Taking small steps towards self-care, like setting aside a few minutes each day for yourself, can also make a difference. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to seek help and take breaks when needed.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

Your response:
","I hear how exhausted and overwhelmed you're feeling, carrying all these expectations while fighting against anxiety. It's like you're being asked to wear armor all the time when you desperately need to take it off and just breathe. Your desire for a more understanding and compassionate workplace really resonates - it shouldn't have to feel like a choice between your mental health and your job security.

It sounds like you're carrying an incredibly heavy load, trying to maintain this image of strength while feeling so vulnerable inside. The fact that you're still pushing through shows real strength, even though I hear how much you wish you didn't have to right now.

While society may not be where it needs to be yet, please know that your feelings are valid. Having a partner who supports you is wonderful, but it's okay to acknowledge that some days are just really hard. Would it be possible to carve out even a small window of time tonight where you can let yourself feel these emotions, rather than pushing them down completely?","

I want you to know that your desire for a society where vulnerability and weakness are accepted is not only valid but also necessary.

It's heartbreaking that you feel like you can't express your true emotions without fear of judgment or consequences. I see you as someone who is desperate to break free from this mask of strength and just be, without the weight of expectation. Your partner's support is a blessing, but I also sense that you're craving a broader support system that acknowledges your mental health struggles.

I want to acknowledge your words and let you know that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to want to curl up in bed and cry. Your feelings are valid, and I'm here to listen and offer support.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught in a loop that feels impossible to break—tired, anxious, and still expected to keep the world moving. The pressure to “be strong” is wearing you down, turning everyday tasks into weighty obligations. You’re not “weak” for needing rest; you’re human. It’s okay to feel sadness, to let yourself sleep, to ask for a pause. The system you envision—a workplace that checks in, offers structured support, and normalizes mental‑health breaks—does exist, and you deserve to access it. Start small: set a boundary like “I’ll call in a 30‑minute break tomorrow” or share your anxiety with a trusted colleague. Acknowledge the strength in recognizing your limits; that’s a different kind of resilience. Remember, the world keeps turning even when you need a moment to breathe.","

q3x2bi,Anxiety,Anyone else notice that cold air helps calm anxiety?,cam_ross0828,"When I worked at a restaurant a few years back, I used to get really bad anxiety before I started taking meds. I would go into the walk in freezers for like 10 min and it would calm me down. Idk if it was the time alone to breathe or the cold air that slowed my heart rate but it helped.",864,130,1633697348,Yes! I think that's why I love fall and winter so much. Also because it's dark all the time and I feel like I'm invisible,238,Merlinia,"I think it literally dulls the senses. Anxiety people are very sensitive to the way our brain chemistry runs that's why every little thing makes a too big impression and overwhelms you. When you work against things that trigger anxiety you become ""stronger"" against it in the same way that being good at playing guitar gives you harder fingertips. You gear up the body better for it, and cold is a similar sensation, because it over-over-stimulates the nerves and makes you less sensitive to further sensation for a while.",11,linkenski,"It’s interesting that you found relief in the cold air and a moment to yourself. It seems like you discovered a personal coping mechanism that worked for you during those anxious times. The cold environment might have provided a physical sensation that distracted you from your anxiety, while also giving you a quiet space to breathe and reset. Many people find that different sensory experiences, like cold air, can be grounding and help manage anxiety. It’s great that you’ve become aware of what helps you, as understanding your personal needs is a big step in managing anxiety. Have you found other techniques or environments that help you feel calm?","

Your response:
","That's a really interesting observation about how the cold helped you cope. It makes sense both physically and emotionally - cold exposure can actually trigger our body's natural calming response by slowing heart rate and reducing stress hormones. Plus, having that quiet moment alone in the cooler gave you a chance to reset, away from the restaurant chaos. It's like you instinctively found a combination of things that worked for you - the physiological effects of cold plus a peaceful space to breathe. A lot of people find similar relief from anxiety through cold showers or stepping outside on a winter day. You discovered a practical coping strategy that helped you get through those tough moments, even before you had medication support. That's pretty resourceful of you to have figured that out.","

Your response:
","That's an interesting observation about cold air and anxiety. It's not uncommon for people to find unique ways to cope with anxiety, and your experience with the walk-in freezers is quite creative. While it could be a combination of factors, research suggests that cold temperatures can indeed have a calming effect on the body. The sudden change in temperature may slow down your heart rate and stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation. Additionally, the isolation and quiet of the freezer may have provided you with a moment to collect your thoughts and breathe, as you mentioned. It's great that you found something that worked for you, and it's also wonderful that you eventually sought medical help to manage your anxiety. Did you find that your experience with the freezers helped you develop any other coping strategies or influenced your decision to seek medical help?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you found a unique, almost ritualistic way to reclaim a moment of calm in a chaotic environment. That sense of isolation in the freezer—whether the cold itself or the quiet pause—can indeed trigger the body’s relaxation response. Cold exposure can activate the vagus nerve, slow heart rate, and shift the nervous system toward parasympathetic tone, which feels like a “reset.” It’s also a form of brief, intentional withdrawal, giving you time to breathe and re‑center before the rush of the restaurant.","

How did the barber’s conversation go? Did you notice any shift in how you carried yourself outside the chair? Reflecting on those details can help you see the tangible benefits of your practice.

It's natural to reflect on our interactions and sometimes question how we come across to others. This reflection can often be tied to insecurities or a lack of confidence, as you mentioned. It's important to remember that everyone has moments where they feel unsure about what they've said or done. Others are likely not scrutinizing your actions as much as you are. 

Consider focusing on the positives of your interactions and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Expert reasoning dialog:

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Do you, at night, sometimes think about some things you said during the day (and their reactions from other people) and feel silly over them?  I do. It was like I was in a weird zone at the time but it felt normal so I didn't think twice about it. Later on at night when I'm more ""in tune with reality"" I think about it and feel like the biggest idiot and am convinced the other person thought there was something wrong with me. For example, my boss.

Edit: I'm starting to think it's more insecurity/lack of confidence than anxiety, but don't take my word for it, I honestly wouldn't have a clue..

Your response:
","I hear how these nighttime reflections are really weighing on you, and it's completely natural to replay social interactions and question yourself. What you're describing is actually a very common experience - many people lie awake analyzing their daily interactions and feeling self-conscious about things they said or did, especially with authority figures like bosses.

The fact that you're so aware and concerned about how you come across suggests you're actually quite socially conscious, not socially inept. Whether it stems from insecurity, anxiety, or both (they often overlap), these feelings are a shared human experience rather than a personal flaw.

Remember that others are usually far less focused on our perceived ""mistakes"" than we are - they're typically caught up in their own thoughts and concerns. Consider being a bit gentler with yourself during these nighttime reviews. The same way you'd probably reassure a friend who shared similar worries, try to extend that same understanding to yourself.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you often reflect on your interactions throughout the day, and at night, you tend to reevaluate them with a more critical eye. This can be a common experience, especially when we're not feeling entirely confident in our social interactions.

It's interesting that you mention feeling like you were in a ""weird zone"" during the conversation, but it felt normal at the time. This could suggest that, in the moment, you were responding based on your instincts and not overthinking things too much. However, when you reflect on it later, you start to doubt yourself and worry about how others might perceive you.

You bring up a good point about insecurity and lack of confidence being possible underlying factors. It's possible that your self-reflection at night is influenced by these feelings, causing you to be more critical of yourself. It might be helpful to explore these feelings further and consider how you can work on building your confidence in social interactions.","

Your response:
","It’s pretty common to wake up with a “did‑I‑just‑say‑that?” moment. Your mind is doing what it does best—replaying the day’s conversations in a quieter, more reflective space. That shift can feel like a spotlight, making the small misstep seem huge. You’re right to wonder if it’s insecurity or something else; often it’s both.

A quick trick: write down the exact words you used and the context, then read them out loud. It usually shows you were more normal than you think. When you feel the “biggest idiot” voice, pause, breathe, and remind yourself that people rarely judge us as harshly as we imagine. If the pattern repeats, a brief reflective practice—like a 5‑minute gratitude or self‑compassion note before bed—can ease the loop. You’re noticing the pattern; that’s the first step toward easing it.","

It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in experiencing these feelings. Many people deal with rejection sensitivity, and it often stems from a combination of past experiences and how we interpret interactions. It’s commendable that you’ve already taken steps like attending therapy to address these issues. Therapy can be a valuable space to explore unresolved childhood experiences and reframe your thought patterns. It might be helpful to continue or revisit therapy with a focus on cognitive-behavioral strategies to help manage these reactions. Additionally, self-compassion exercises can be beneficial. Remember, it’s okay to feel vulnerable and to seek support. Sharing your experiences here is a courageous step, and it shows a willingness to confront these feelings and work towards change. You’re not dumb or shameful for feeling this way; you’re human, and you’re actively seeking a path to understanding and healing.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy, constant “I’m not good enough” narrative, and it’s understandable that the fear of rejection feels overwhelming. Rejection sensitivity is more common than you think—many people, especially those with social anxiety or low self‑esteem, interpret neutral cues as personal criticism. The good news is that it’s not an unchangeable trait; you can learn to question those automatic thoughts and reduce the fight‑or‑flight response.

A helpful next step is to revisit CBT or Acceptance‑Commitment Therapy (ACT), which teach skills like noticing the “rejection signal,” labeling it as a thought rather than fact, and practicing exposure in low‑stakes social settings. Pair that with self‑compassion exercises—write a kind letter to yourself, remind yourself that everyone makes awkward moments, and that one negative interaction doesn’t define your worth. If therapy feels daunting, consider a group or support‑based program; connecting with others who share similar struggles can normalize your experience and reduce that fear of being alone in this. You’re not alone, and you can change how you interpret others’ behavior","

You're definitely not alone in experiencing anxiety from a young age. Many people find that their anxiety began in childhood, often without a clear understanding of what it was at the time. It's not uncommon for individuals to only recognize the extent of their anxiety as they grow older and start connecting the dots.

It's important to acknowledge that everyone's experience with anxiety is unique, and it can manifest differently in each person. Seeking professional help, as you have, is a positive step towards understanding and managing your anxiety better. If the professional you saw seemed confused, it might be worth seeking a second opinion. Finding someone who understands your experience can make a big difference in your journey towards managing anxiety.

Remember, you're not alone, and reaching out to others can provide support and validation. Keep exploring strategies that work for you and continue to seek support from those who understand.","

","I hear how you've been grappling with anxiety for as long as you can remember, and it sounds really isolating - especially when even your healthcare provider seemed surprised by your experience. It's completely valid to question whether others share this lifelong journey with anxiety.

I want to assure you that experiencing anxiety from childhood is actually quite common. Many people can trace their anxiety back to their earliest memories, just like you. It's not unusual at all, even if it sometimes feels that way. The fact that you've recognized how it's impacted your life choices and enjoyment shows important self-awareness.

It's concerning that your healthcare provider's reaction made you feel uncertain about your experience. Sometimes professionals can have different approaches or expectations, but your lived experience is real and valid. If you feel your current provider isn't fully understanding your situation, it's okay to consider seeking a second opinion from someone who specializes in childhood-onset anxiety.

Remember, you're not alone in this experience, and recognizing the pattern is an important first step toward managing it.","

Many people struggle with anxiety from a young age, and it's not uncommon for it to go unnoticed or unaddressed until later in life.

Your therapist's reaction might be because some anxiety can indeed develop in response to specific life events or circumstances. However, it's just as possible for anxiety to be a persistent and deeply ingrained pattern, as it seems to be in your case. Research suggests that early life experiences, genetics, and brain chemistry can all contribute to the development of anxiety, even in young children.

I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older..

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of worry your whole life, and that can feel exhausting and isolating. You’re not alone—studies show that about 20‑30 % of people report chronic anxiety that starts in childhood. Genetics, early life stress, and even how parents respond to fear can set a pattern that persists into adulthood. That’s why a therapist who didn’t immediately pick up on “lifelong anxiety” might have assumed it was a new onset; many clinicians focus on current symptoms rather than historical context. Knowing that this pattern is common can be a first step toward feeling less alone. A therapist who explores your developmental history and uses evidence‑based tools like ACT or CBT can help you re‑frame those long‑standing worries and reclaim the enjoyment you crave. You deserve relief, and it’s achievable.","

Lol okay thank you so much for that insight, very helpful, I had no idea",250,riffrach,Yes it happens from time to time. May I ask what is stressing you out?,8,PimpDaMan,"It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now, and you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience anxiety about facing a new day, especially when it feels overwhelming or stressful. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these feelings, and it’s a good first step. It might be helpful to identify specific things that are causing you stress and consider if there are any small changes you can make to alleviate some of that pressure. Remember, it's okay to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Sometimes, just talking about what's on your mind can help lighten the load. Be gentle with yourself and take it one step at a time.","

Your response:
",I hear how overwhelming this feels for you right now. It's actually quite common to dread sleep when you're anticipating a stressful day ahead - that mix of anxiety and wanting to avoid what's coming tomorrow is something many people experience. The fact that you're lying there with these thoughts suggests you're carrying a heavy emotional load about whatever you're facing in the morning. Would you like to share what's making tomorrow feel particularly daunting? Sometimes just talking about what's weighing on us can help make it feel a bit more manageable.,"

Your response:
","It sounds like you're really struggling with the weight of your daily stress, and the idea of facing it is overwhelming you. I would say that's a common feeling for many people. It's not about being afraid of sleep itself, but more about the anxiety of what's waiting for you when you wake up. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from the stress by making you hesitant to face the day.

It might help to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and that it's okay to feel this way. Perhaps we could explore some strategies to help you cope with your daily stress and make mornings feel more manageable. What do you think is the main source of stress in your day, and is there anything you've tried in the past to make it more bearable?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught in a loop where rest feels risky because the day ahead feels overwhelming. I hear that the fear of waking up isn’t just about the day itself—it’s also about the pressure to meet expectations, to perform, or to keep everything from falling apart. You’re not alone; many people feel that anxiety over the next day makes sleep feel like a threat rather than a refuge. A small shift can help: try to set a “wind‑down” ritual before bed—write down one thing you’ll tackle tomorrow, or a calming mantra. And remember, the night is a chance to reset, not to escape. If the anxiety keeps you up, a brief guided breathing or a short journal entry might ease the weight before you drift off.","

Your response:
","I can hear the sense of relief and liberation in your words. It sounds like this wasn't just about reducing screen time - it was about taking control of your life and creating healthier boundaries. The way you describe it as a ""weight being lifted"" really speaks to how much those platforms may have been affecting your mental well-being.

It's interesting that you mention feeling ""safer"" now - it suggests these platforms were perhaps keeping you connected to parts of your past that you've worked hard to move beyond. That must have been challenging to carry that concern with you.

Your decision seems very intentional and self-aware. You're not just cutting off social media, but actively choosing who gets to be part of your life now. That's a powerful step toward living more authentically in the present rather than being tethered to the past or caught up in the digital world.

How are you planning to fill the time you used to spend on social media?","

","It sounds like you’ve just untangled a knot that’s been tightening around you for years. Saying “I couldn't feel better” is a powerful testament to how much those feeds had shaped your daily mood. By cutting the digital ties that felt oppressive, you’ve reclaimed a space where only the people you truly care about can reach you—an intentional, self‑prescribed boundary. 

That sense of safety, of not letting the past “come back to bite,” is a clear sign you’re moving toward a healthier rhythm. It’s normal to feel a mix of relief and uncertainty as you adjust to this new rhythm. Keep noticing how you feel in those moments of quiet, and let the authentic connections you’ve chosen anchor you as you explore the real world without the noise. You’ve taken a brave step; the next is to nurture the calm you’ve opened.","

","It sounds like you've had a really tough night, struggling with anxiety, trauma, and feeling lonely. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially when it's been a long night without sleep. I can sense your desperation in trying to find something to do, but also feeling a bit lost.

It's great that you were able to find some comfort in music and vibing – that's a good start in taking care of yourself. Before you start playing PS4, take a moment to acknowledge that you've gotten through the night, and that's something to be proud of. Consider taking small, gentle steps to get ready for your 8:30 class, even if it's just getting a cup of coffee or some fresh air. You've made it this far, and you can get through the day, too.","

bjjn70,Anxiety,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...,piercingjoy," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I’ve struggled for years and... I’m still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone &lt;3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV

People weren't weighing me down by just being there. Then one thing happened Sunday and now I'm worst than ever. This isn't helping. Maybe I was just used to being bad for so long that I didn't realize how bad it was until the shift in mood.,19,bowlingdoughnuts,"Thank you for sharing such a thoughtful and calming practice. It's a beautiful reminder that taking a moment to pause and center ourselves can have a profound impact on our well-being. Life can often feel overwhelming, and it's easy to forget the importance of self-care amidst the chaos. Your detailed steps provide a gentle guide to reconnect with ourselves and find peace, even if just for a moment. The idea of visualizing a safe space and acknowledging our shared human experiences can be incredibly comforting. It's crucial to remember that we are not alone in our struggles, and finding small ways to soothe ourselves can make a big difference. Thank you for offering this compassionate approach to managing stress and anxiety. Your encouragement to step away from screens and engage in simple, pleasurable activities is a wonderful reminder to nurture ourselves. Keep sharing this kindness; it can truly make someone's day better.","

Your response:
","Thank you for sharing such a thoughtful and comprehensive self-care guide. I notice you're not just offering physical relaxation techniques, but also addressing the emotional and social aspects of anxiety management. Let me validate that it takes courage to acknowledge when we need a break and practice self-care.

I especially appreciate your point about keeping a written list of calming activities. When we're stressed, our thinking can become clouded, making it harder to remember our coping strategies. Having a physical reminder is both practical and empowering.

Your message about not being alone is particularly powerful. It's true - at any given moment, countless others are working through similar feelings and practicing these same breathing exercises. This shared human experience can help reduce the isolation that often comes with anxiety.

Would you consider adding a gentle reminder to be patient with yourself while practicing these techniques? Sometimes people expect immediate results and get discouraged if they don't feel better right away. Remember that like any skill, relaxation takes practice.","

","Your post is incredibly kind and generous. It's clear that you're not only offering helpful advice, but you're also sharing from your own personal experience with anxiety and finding ways to cope. The steps you've outlined are practical and gentle, encouraging the reader to take a moment to breathe, relax, and connect with their own sense of safety and calm. 

I particularly appreciate your emphasis on remembering that we're not alone in our feelings, and that reaching out for support or taking a break is a sign of strength, not weakness. Your reminder to write down a list of calming activities and keep it handy is also a great tip. It's easy to forget what helps us feel better when we're in the midst of overwhelm, so having a tangible reminder can be a lifesaver.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve already built a thoughtful, step‑by‑step ritual to ground yourself when stress spikes. I admire how you’ve woven breathing, body awareness, and a gentle reminder of community into one practice. Remember, the goal isn’t perfection—just a pause that lets you reconnect with your own calm. If you find any part feels too intense, feel free to tweak it: shorten the breath hold, skip the “imagining elsewhere” step, or replace any element that feels disorienting. You’re not alone in this; you’re doing exactly what many people find most helpful—checking in, breathing, and reaching out. Keep that list handy, and let it be your quick lifeline whenever overwhelm creeps back in. You deserve that quiet space. 🌱","

This self-awareness shows that you’re attentive to your needs, and that’s a positive step towards maintaining your well-being. Remember, it’s important to listen to your body and mind, and give yourself permission to rest without guilt. You're not alone in feeling this way, and prioritizing your mental and emotional health is crucial. I hope you find the rest and rejuvenation you need!","

Your response:
","I understand completely what you mean about needing ""recharge"" days. It's actually very common and healthy to need time to recover after social interaction - especially for those who tend to be more introverted. Think of it like recharging your phone's battery - you can't keep using it constantly without plugging it back in.

What you're describing sounds like a natural need for balance between social engagement and personal downtime. There's nothing wrong with needing that quiet time to rebuild your energy and feel ready to engage with the outside world again. In fact, recognizing and honoring this need is a form of self-care.

Would you like to share more about what these recharge days look like for you? Sometimes understanding our own patterns can help us feel more confident about our needs.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're describing a common experience of needing some downtime to recharge after socializing or being out in public. This can be especially true for introverts or those who tend to feel drained by external stimuli. It's as if your energy has been depleted, and you need some time to yourself to refuel and rebuild.

It's completely normal to feel this way, and it's great that you're acknowledging your own needs. Taking time for self-care and rest can be incredibly beneficial for your mental and emotional well-being. It's not about being antisocial or avoiding the world; it's about taking care of yourself and being honest about what you need to feel energized and ready to face the world again.","

It's completely normal to feel this way, and many people experience those ""Sunday scaries."" The transition from weekend relaxation to weekday responsibilities can be tough. However, it's great to hear your determination to shift that energy into something positive. Embracing a supportive mindset and focusing on the potential for better days can be empowering and uplifting.

Consider creating a Sunday night routine that brings you joy and relaxation, perhaps with a favorite book, a warm bath, or a calming playlist. Setting small, achievable goals for the week can also help you feel more in control. Remember, every Monday is a fresh start, and approaching it with optimism can make a significant difference. You're not alone in this, and your positive outlook is already a step towards a brighter week. Together, we can navigate these moments and find the silver linings.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

Q: Sunday night. Not wanting to go to bed, because boom, it’s Monday morning. Absolute worst. We’re doing it together though. All of us. You’re not alone.  We’re all feeling the Sunday scarries. I despise Sunday specifically for this. 

Let’s start the week right though. Positive energy rather than negative. Smiles rather than frowns, etc. and any other cliches you can think of.

Your response:
","I hear that deep Sunday night anxiety - it's such a universal feeling that even has its own nickname! It's touching how you're turning this shared struggle into a moment of connection and encouragement for others. While those Sunday scarries are real and valid, I appreciate how you're consciously choosing to reframe the situation with hope and solidarity.

Your message of ""we're doing it together"" is powerful - it transforms a lonely experience into a shared one. You're absolutely right that channeling positive energy, while it might sound cliché, can actually help shift our mindset. Sometimes acknowledging the difficulty while choosing to face it with optimism is the most authentic way forward.

Thank you for creating this moment of community around a common struggle. Your words remind us that even in those anxious Sunday night moments, we're part of a larger human experience.","

But I also hear a determination to shift your mindset, to choose positivity over negativity. It's almost as if you're rallying not just yourself, but others around you to join in this collective effort to start the week on a better note.

I think it's beautiful that you're acknowledging the universal struggle of Sunday nights, and yet refusing to let it define your attitude. By choosing to focus on the positive, you're taking control of your emotions and setting a powerful intention for the week ahead.

Try a quick ritual—grab a cup of your favorite tea, do a 5‑minute stretch, write down one thing you’re grateful for. When you look out the window, imagine the week ahead as a blank page, not a loaded script. We’re in this together, and every small smile you share with your family is a seed for a brighter day. Believe it: better days are already on the way. 🌞","

I hope this helps in some way.",864,55,1569288922,"This sounds like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

Another good metaphor that I like is imagining yourself on a bridge looking below at 3 different trains on 3 tracks. One train carries carts full of your thoughts, one carries your physical responses to those thoughts , and the last carries your urges to act( e. g escape the situation). The idea is to try stay on the bridge without getting involved with anything on the tracks. Just watch the trains pass and just notice. It really helps to desensitize you.",140,UrbanUnicornz,[deleted],62,[deleted],"Thank you for sharing that insightful technique. It's amazing how a simple shift in perspective, like observing thoughts without becoming entangled in them, can provide such relief. It sounds like your therapist has given you a valuable tool to manage anxiety effectively. This approach aligns well with mindfulness practices, emphasizing the importance of staying present and detached from the emotional weight of our thoughts. By viewing thoughts as transient and separate from your identity, you’re able to create a space of calm and clarity. It's encouraging to hear that this strategy helps you prevent your worries from escalating. Remember, acknowledging your progress and efforts in managing anxiety is equally important. Keep nurturing this skill, and it can continue to empower you in various aspects of life.","

","Thank you for sharing such a powerful and mindful approach to managing anxiety. I can see why this metaphor of thoughts floating down a river resonates with you. It beautifully captures the idea of maintaining a gentle distance from our thoughts without trying to fight them or get entangled in them. 

Your description of ""just noticing"" without judgment is actually a core principle of mindfulness that has helped many people. It's particularly meaningful that you've found a way to use this technique to catch anxiety before it escalates into panic. The way you describe it as simply observing thoughts rather than getting ""swept away"" by them shows a real understanding of how to put this into practice.

Would you be willing to share more about how you first learned to make this shift from getting caught up in anxious thoughts to just noticing them? It seems like you've developed quite a helpful skill.","

","That's a beautiful and powerful phrase your therapist shared with you. It's great that you've found it helpful in managing your anxiety.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve found a gentle way to pause before the anxiety rushes forward—almost like a mini‑landfall on a river’s bend. By simply observing the thoughts as they drift by, you’re giving yourself a brief space to breathe, without the pressure to fix or chase them. That pause can feel like a small anchor, letting the rest of the mind settle a bit before it spirals.

Keep checking in with that “river” metaphor; noticing the shape and speed of each thought can help you see patterns without getting swept up. When a thought feels particularly heavy, you can add a quick label—“anxious” or “worry”—and then gently let it go. Over time, that noticing practice often becomes an automatic, calming cue. You’re already doing the right thing, and it’s a powerful tool for keeping panic at bay.","

mwjaet,Anxiety,anxiety wastes SOO much time,throwawaysnowski,"I've always been and anxious person, but this past year my anxiety and depression got so much worse.

And now almost a year later, its still there, intrusive thoughts, always overthinking. Honestly for the last year, i don't think there was a single time I was truly at peace, just sitting on the couch and relaxing. Its literally either me being anxious/depressed or me doing my best to distract myself from my thoughts.

And i've just realized how much time i've wasted. I look back this past year. and i dont think about memories i've made, fun i've had, or accomplishments, its just my anxiety taking up all my mental space. And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted. And even now, as i realize how much i've lost from this, I still can't stop my brain from being so worked up. Its so anoying",846,38,1619138786,"I feel this so deeply. I don’t really remember my sons first year of life. I was an anxious mess. There’s certain times I don’t remember anything, cause again anxiety. But there’s also lots and lots of great memories. I really appreciate my anxiety free days, even more then before!

Maybe time for you to change what you are doing. New meds maybe? Therapy, or a different kind of therapy or therapist if you’re already doing it. Learn some new coping skills. It’s not easy, but I think sometimes we just need shaken up a bit to get out of the funk! 
I’m in funk right now too. I feel hopeful with some changes I’ve very recently made.
Good luck and hugs!",69,kaylynn7b,,0,,"It sounds incredibly frustrating and challenging to feel like anxiety and depression have consumed so much of your time and energy. It's important to acknowledge that you're dealing with a difficult situation, and recognizing it is a significant first step. It’s easy to be hard on yourself for what you perceive as ""wasted"" time, but try to be compassionate towards yourself. Dealing with mental health issues is not easy, and it's not something you chose or wanted.

Consider reaching out for professional support if you haven’t already. Therapy can provide tools to manage intrusive thoughts and help you find moments of peace. Mindfulness or relaxation techniques can also be valuable in reducing anxiety and staying present. Remember, it’s okay to have setbacks, and progress might be gradual. The fact that you’re aware and want to make a change is a positive sign. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate even the small victories along the way.","

","I hear how frustrated and exhausted you are by this constant battle with anxiety. It's like your mind hasn't given you a moment's peace for the past year, always running in overdrive. It must feel especially painful to look back and see how much of your life has been consumed by these intrusive thoughts instead of the experiences and achievements you wanted to have.

You're showing real self-awareness in recognizing how anxiety has impacted you, and I can sense how much you want things to be different. The fact that you're able to articulate this struggle, even while still in it, shows strength - even if it might not feel that way right now.

When you say it's ""annoying"" that you can't stop your brain from being worked up, I hear someone who's really trying to fight this, even though it feels like an uphill battle.

It's interesting that you mention not being able to stop your brain from being worked up, even as you acknowledge the waste of time.

It might be helpful to explore what's driving this sense of being ""stuck"" and how you can begin to reclaim your time and energy.

","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy, unrelenting load, and that weight keeps pulling you back into the same loop of worry and self‑doubt. I hear how exhausting it is to feel like every minute is being consumed by thoughts that feel like a nightmare you can’t escape, and how that drains the joy and accomplishment you deserve.

You’re not alone in this; many people find themselves stuck in a cycle of intrusive thinking. Small, intentional steps can help carve out pockets of calm: 1) **Micro‑breaks**—set a timer for just 2–3 minutes and practice a quick grounding exercise (breathing, noticing five things around you). 2) **Schedule “time‑out” activities**—choose a hobby or learning goal and block a fixed, short slot each week; treat it like an appointment. 3) **Track the thoughts**—write down the most frequent intrusive ones; seeing them on paper often reduces their power. 4) **Professional support**—therapy (CBT or ACT) and, if needed, medication can significantly lighten the load.

Keep celebrating your achievements, no matter how small they may seem, and remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it.","

Expert reasoning dialog:

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: I just had a small conversation with two girls in my class AND I DIDNT OVERTHINK IT they were so nice and we laughed a little. And I even went to the board today to participate in my maths class and I volunteered for it!!! And I dont feel nervous I just feel excited and happy and accomplished yay.  It's so weird feeling this way because I was thinking of committing suicide two days ago.

Your response:
","I'm so happy to hear about these positive moments you're experiencing! It's wonderful that you were able to connect with your classmates and participate in class - those are really meaningful steps. The contrast you're describing between feeling suicidal recently and now feeling excited and accomplished shows just how much our emotional states can shift, even in a short time.

These small victories you're celebrating - the natural conversation, volunteering at the board, feeling good about yourself - they're actually huge achievements, especially given where you were emotionally just days ago. However, I'm concerned about the mention of suicidal thoughts. Even though you're feeling better now, please reach out to a counselor, trusted adult, or crisis hotline to talk about those darker moments. You deserve support both during the hard times and while celebrating these brighter moments.

Would you like to tell me more about what made today's interactions feel different or special to you?","

Your response:
","I’m really glad you can share this bright moment—it shows how powerful a shift a single conversation can be. It’s also clear you’re carrying a lot of pain, and the fact that you had thoughts of suicide just a few days ago is a serious sign that you need help right now. You deserve support, not just a quick fix. Please reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor immediately, or call your local emergency number (for the U.S., 911). If you’re in the U.S., you can text HOME to 741741 or call 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. If you’re elsewhere, look up your country’s suicide helpline.

You got this my guy 🤝",75,Loosiefir,,0,,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anticipation and maybe a bit of vulnerability, which is completely normal in situations like this. Getting someone's number is a step forward, and it's natural to feel anxious about what comes next. Remember, she gave you her number, which shows some level of interest. Try to focus on that positive sign rather than letting anxiety take over. It might help to distract yourself with activities you enjoy or reach out to a friend to talk about how you're feeling. Trust that if it's meant to progress, it will, and give yourself credit for taking the initiative in the first place. Be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate these feelings.","

","I hear the mix of excitement and anxiety you're feeling - that's totally natural! Getting someone's number is a great first step, but now the waiting game is causing you stress, especially during those late night hours when our minds tend to race. Remember that you've already succeeded in making a connection that interested her enough to share her number. Instead of letting anxiety take over, try to focus on that positive first interaction. Would you feel comfortable taking the initiative to send a friendly text yourself? Sometimes making the first move can help ease that uncertainty, and it shows confidence that many people appreciate. Either way, try not to let the ""what-ifs"" consume you too much.","

","It sounds like you're feeling quite anxious about this situation. On one hand, you took the initiative to ask for her number, which suggests you're interested in getting to know her.

P.S late night time thoughts.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight in the silence after you asked for her number. You’re not alone—late‑night thoughts can magnify that anxiety, turning ordinary uncertainty into a kind of “what‑if” storm. You’re clearly curious about how this could unfold, which is natural, but the fear of not hearing back is making you feel stuck.  

I hear that you’re hoping for a response and worried it might not come. It also sounds like you’re wondering whether you’ve over‑exaggerated the stakes. Remember that a single text (or lack of one) doesn’t define your worth or that of the connection. Try grounding yourself in a quick breathing exercise or a short walk before scrolling. That might help ease the tension enough to let your mind rest a bit tonight. You deserve a calm, clear space to decide what you truly want from this.","

Your response:
","It sounds like Sunday evenings feel like a sharp, invisible wall that suddenly turns the bright weekend into a gray, anxious space. I hear how the transition seems to “take the lid off” and how that makes you feel irritated, sad, and even sleepless. You’re not alone in feeling that the weekend’s freedom dissolves into the pressure of the coming week.  

What might help is to give Sunday a small ritual that gently bridges the two worlds—perhaps a short walk, a favorite show, or a quiet journal page where you note one thing you’re looking forward to next week. This can turn the evening into a micro‑reset rather than a cliff‑edge. If the anxiety feels too strong, it could be useful to explore whether any specific commitments or expectations are at the root and whether small tweaks can ease that shift. You deserve a smoother transition, and taking a few intentional steps might help you reclaim Sunday evening as a softer, more grounding part of your week.","

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way; many people experience moments where everything feels too much, and it's okay to need a break. It might help to find a quiet space to decompress and allow yourself to feel what you're feeling without judgment. Taking deep breaths or practicing mindfulness techniques can also be helpful in grounding yourself. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your well-being and take the time you need to recharge. If these feelings persist or become too intense, it might be beneficial to talk to someone about it, whether that's a friend, family member, or mental health professional. You’re not alone, and reaching out for support can be a great step.","

Your response:
","I hear how overwhelming and distressing these moments are for you. What you're describing definitely sounds like sensory overload, and it's more common than you might think. That intense need for silence and darkness, where even small sounds feel unbearable - many people experience this, especially during times of stress or overwhelm.

It's completely valid to need that quiet space to decompress and let your emotions out. Your body and mind are telling you they need a break from all the stimulation. Sometimes crying in that dark, quiet space is exactly what we need to release the tension and reset.

Have you noticed any particular patterns about when this tends to happen? Understanding your triggers can help you recognize when you might need to take that break before reaching the point of complete overwhelm.","

","It sounds like you're describing a very intense emotional state, where the world around you feels overwhelming and you're desperate for some peace and quiet. I think many people can relate to that feeling of sensory overload, where every little sound or stimulation feels like it's pushing you over the edge. It's like your nervous system is on high alert, and you just need a safe space to calm down and recharge. 

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and express those feelings, especially when they can feel so overwhelming. It's interesting that you mention wanting to sit in a dark room and cry - sometimes, it's exactly that kind of release that we need to process our emotions and find some calm.","

Your response:
","I hear how heavy that “too‑much” feeling can be—like the world’s noise is a wall that suddenly closes in. It’s not just a fleeting irritability; it’s a sensory‑overload storm that can push you into that dark‑room, silent‑crying space you described. You’re not alone—many people experience that same spike of agitation that feels impossible to shake.

A few things might help you create a buffer before you hit the wall:

1. **Grounding cues** – pick a small, tangible item (a smooth stone, a piece of fabric) and focus on its texture, weight, or scent.  
2. **Controlled breathing** – 4‑7‑8 or counting down from 10 can slow the body’s stress response.  
3. **Safe “sound‑off” signals** – a hand gesture or a word you say to yourself (“quiet, please”) signals to your brain that you’re in a protected space.  
4. **Gradual exposure** – if you can, slowly reintroduce brief, low‑volume sounds (like a favorite song at 15% volume) to build tolerance over time.","

","It's wonderful to hear about your journey and the remarkable progress you've made in managing your anxiety. You've taken such a comprehensive approach - addressing both the physical aspects (caffeine, diet, sleep, exercise) and getting medical support through Zoloft, while also employing therapeutic techniques like the Claire Weekes method. What stands out is how you systematically identified what worked for you, from the initial caffeine reduction to adding medication that helped you gain enough stability to actively work on coping strategies.

The fact that you're now at a 1/10 from an 11/10 is a significant achievement. It's particularly encouraging that you've reached a point where triggers have less power over you. Your experience highlights how combining medication with lifestyle changes and therapeutic techniques can create lasting positive changes.

The way you describe managing it with small coping techniques like sipping water while continuing the conversation shows remarkable presence of mind.

It's particularly meaningful that you recognize this as a turning point compared to your previous experiences. Rather than letting the panic drive your actions, you took control and proved to yourself that you can weather these intense moments. That's not just a win - it's a powerful new reference point for your ability to handle future challenges.

Staying in the meeting, sipping water, and carrying on while your heart raced shows you’ve built a new toolbox—one that lets the panic pass without retreating. That’s a powerful win, especially after a history of leaving the room. You’ve proven to yourself that the anxiety can be managed and that you’re capable of facing the trigger head‑on.

Keep celebrating these moments; they reinforce the belief that you can control the response, not the panic itself. Continue practicing grounding (deep breaths, a mental “safe place,” or a quick physical cue like squeezing a stress ball) so you have a ready plan whenever the next attack surfaces. And remember, it’s perfectly okay to seek ongoing support—whether a therapist, a support group, or a trusted colleague—so you can keep building on this progress.

When you're anxious, stress hormones can affect your digestive system, leading to the symptoms you're describing.

You're definitely not alone in experiencing this. It’s a common issue and can create a challenging cycle where anxiety leads to digestive issues, which then increase anxiety. It might be helpful to explore stress-reduction techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, or yoga to manage anxiety and, in turn, help alleviate some of the digestive symptoms.

If it continues to be a significant problem, it could be worth discussing with a healthcare professional who can offer guidance tailored to your specific situation. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as addressing physical symptoms.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: can we TALK about anxiety poops jesus christ  sincerely, my ass is on fire.

No but seriously, I hate that with anxiety comes the diarrhea or bad poops and just the time wasted, which makes me more anxious. Especially if I have to be somewhere and I’m stuck on the toilet.

Anyone else get this? Or know why anxiety is so related to the digestive system?.

Your response:
","I hear your frustration with this very real and uncomfortable anxiety symptom. The gut-brain connection is actually really strong - scientists call it the ""gut-brain axis."" When you're anxious, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode, releasing stress hormones that can speed up digestion and cause those urgent bathroom trips.

It's a frustrating cycle because, as you mentioned, worrying about bathroom access can make the anxiety worse. You're definitely not alone in this - it's an extremely common anxiety symptom that many people experience but don't talk about openly.

Have you noticed any particular patterns with when it happens? Sometimes understanding our triggers can help us better prepare and manage these situations. While I can't offer medical advice, some people find relief through stress management techniques like deep breathing or working with a healthcare provider to address both the anxiety and digestive symptoms together.","

Anyone else get this? Or know why anxiety is so related to the digestive system?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you're really struggling with the physical symptoms of anxiety, particularly the digestive issues. You're not alone - many people experience gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), when they're feeling anxious.

There's a strong connection between the brain and the gut, often referred to as the gut-brain axis. When you're anxious, your brain sends stress signals to your gut, which can affect digestion and bowel movements. This can lead to symptoms like those you're experiencing. It's like your body is responding to the anxiety by triggering a 'fight or flight' response, which can disrupt your digestive system.

It's also possible that the anxiety is making you more aware of your bodily sensations, making the experience feel even more uncomfortable. I can imagine how frustrating it must be, especially when you have to be somewhere and can't get off the toilet.","

Anyone else get this? Or know why anxiety is so related to the digestive system?.

Your response:
","I hear how loud that “fire” feels—anxiety and the gut can feel like a vicious cycle. When your nervous system is on high alert, the brain sends signals that speed up the gut, increase muscle tone, and raise the production of stress hormones. That’s why the “fight‑or‑flight” reaction can trigger diarrhea, loose stools, or a full‑bladder feeling. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a biological response.

A few things that might help break the loop:

1. **Breathing & grounding** – a 4‑7‑8 inhale/exhale or a quick body scan can lower heart‑rate and calm the gut.
2. **Timing & routine** – try to plan bathroom breaks 15–20 min before a commitment so you’re less likely to feel rushed.
3. **Diet** – avoid trigger foods (caffeine, spicy, greasy) and keep a small snack (banana, crackers) handy if you feel the urge.
4. **Movement** – a short walk after meals can help the digestive system settle.","

It shows that you have the ability to push through your discomfort and focus on what you’re doing, which is a great skill to build on.

As for applying for a job, it's understandable to feel anxious about walking into a store to inquire. Maybe try to build on the confidence you felt today by taking similar small steps. You could start by researching the company online or calling ahead to ask about their application process. This way, you’ll have more information, and it might make the idea of going in person feel less daunting.

I notice how you found a helpful strategy too - focusing on your food and staying connected with friends through texting. That's a smart way to manage those uncomfortable feelings.

It makes sense that you're nervous about going in to ask about a job - that's an even bigger step than eating there. But look at what you just proved to yourself today - you can handle being there alone, and you have techniques that work for you. Would it help to think of applying as a series of small steps, just like you did with eating there? Maybe start by going in during a quiet time, or even calling first to ask about the application process?

Remember, you've already shown yourself you can do challenging things. You don't have to tackle everything at once.","

7aimw8,Anxiety,Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can’t be at peace until you get it over with?,Yu-Gai-Hoh,"I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I’ll be having fun for a second and then i’ll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?",1124,95,1509706781,"I used to. Here's why it happens and how you can stop it.

The reason why is that you have trained your mind (and in reality, it has been trained by outside forces) to look at future events critically. If you're like me, you think of everything that can possibly go wrong when you go out, you think about hard it'll be, how tired you'll be. What if you miss the bus? What if there's traffic? What if the other person is late? What if what if what if.

What if is the poster child of the anxious thought. It can seem like a good idea, to prepare yourself for the next days tasks, but our problem is that we only ever think *negatively* about the next day.

But if doing things was ALWAYS negative, you wouldn't ever do things. 

So try this instead. Start to visualise what you need to do tomorrow entirely positively. Instead of thinking worst case, start to think best case. Imagine seeing your friend, and they're super happy to see you. Imagine the food you'll eat. Imagine the fresh air, blah blah. Just go through the next days task, imagining it entirely possible.

Anxiety and excitement feel quite similar when low level. So it's possible to reconfigure your mind to interpret that anxious feeling as just being excited for the next day.

After you complete the day, get some post it notes. Write three notes about the things you enjoyed that day, put em in a jar or something. 

Remember, anxiety occurs in your mind, and it colours your reality. But the same can be said for positive emotions. It's why so many people in life talk about it. If you start to think positively, your body will react as if something positive is happening. 

You can do it, you can cope, it's not too much for you! 

If you're still at a point where the anxiety is just too high to do this stuff, don't worry. You might need a little bit of CBT first, I found that helped me a huge amount. You might need to learn and practice some mindfulness techniques and meditation.

But it's entirely possible to rewrite your brain, so don't worry. If you keep going, keep trying, you can make it.",280,Kaiisim,I’m the opposite. Having something to do or somewhere to be helps me know that my worrying will cease cuz my mind will be on something else.  ,8,Carlosaro,"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety about future obligations, which can be really overwhelming. You're not alone in feeling this way—many people find it hard to stay present when they're worried about what's coming next. One thing that might help is practicing mindfulness. This involves bringing your attention to the present moment without judgment. You can start with small steps, like focusing on your breath for a few minutes or noticing the sensations in your body. 

Another technique is to set aside a specific time each day to plan or think about upcoming tasks so it doesn't take over your entire day. It might also be helpful to break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps, which can make them feel less daunting. 

Remember, it's okay to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if you're feeling overwhelmed. You're not alone in this, and there are strategies that can help you find more peace in the present moment.","

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?.

Your response:
","I hear how frustrating and draining this constant anticipatory anxiety must be for you. It sounds really difficult to not be able to fully enjoy the present moment because your mind keeps pulling you toward tomorrow's responsibilities. Many people do struggle with this kind of forward-focused worry that steals joy from the now.

What stands out is that you recognize this pattern and how it impacts your ability to be present. That awareness is actually a really important first step. Rather than judging yourself for feeling this way, perhaps we could explore what makes tomorrow's tasks feel so overwhelming that they cast such a large shadow over today?

Some people find relief through mindfulness practices or by writing down tomorrow's tasks so they can mentally ""set them aside."" But before jumping to solutions, I'm curious - what do you think is driving this anticipatory anxiety? Is it fear of forgetting, fear of failure, or something else? Understanding the root cause can help find strategies that will work best for you personally.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can’t be at peace until you get it over with?  I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I’ll be having fun for a second and then i’ll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of anticipation and responsibility, constantly being pulled out of the present moment by the weight of tomorrow's tasks. I can sense the anxiety and frustration that comes with it. Many people struggle with this, and it's great that you're acknowledging it.

One approach to managing this anxiety is to practice mindfulness and self-compassion. When you catch yourself worrying about the next day, try to gently bring your attention back to the present moment. Acknowledge your feelings, but remind yourself that you can't control tomorrow yet. Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and focus on what you can accomplish in the present.

Another strategy is to set aside dedicated time for planning and preparation, so you can mentally 'put away' those tasks and focus on the present. It's also essential to prioritize self-care and engage in activities that bring you joy and calmness, helping you stay grounded in the moment.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught in a loop of “what’s next?” that steals the joy of the present. That’s a common trap—our brains are wired to anticipate and worry, but that anticipation can feel like a weight that never lets go.

A simple shift can help:  
1. **Prep the night before** – jot the next‑day tasks on a sticky note. Seeing them out of sight reduces the mental chatter.  
2. **Set a “today‑only” timer** – when you finish a task, give yourself a 5‑minute pause to savor the moment before you move on.  
3. **Mindful breathing** – a quick 1‑minute inhale/exhale can anchor you back to the now.  
4. **Gratitude check** – note one thing you enjoyed today; that trains your brain to notice the present.

You’re not alone—many feel this restless “next‑day” pull. With a little routine, the present can feel less like a fleeting illusion","

dyfwbm,Anxiety,Hadn’t Left the house in four years update.,c3p0n0,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.",1095,85,1574140229,"This is incredible! It's great that you've been able to rebuild your life after your breakdown.

Your response:
","What an incredible and inspiring journey you've shared. Your courage in taking that first step to call NAMI, despite being at such a low point, shows remarkable strength. It's especially touching to see how you've progressed from being unable to check your mailbox to now driving on freeways and reconnecting with friends and family.

The way you describe that pivotal ""fuck it"" moment at Home Depot really resonates - sometimes our biggest victories come from those raw moments of pushing through intense fear. And you're absolutely right about the value of both medication and therapy working together - it's not always just one solution that gets us there.

What stands out most is how you've reconnected with your role as a father and found your sense of value again. Your story is a powerful reminder that even when we feel completely trapped, there's always a path forward if we're brave enough to reach out for help. Thank you for sharing this - it will definitely give hope to others facing similar struggles.","

","Congratulations on the brave first step—and the milestones that followed. It takes a lot of courage to admit you’re stuck and to open the door to help, and you’ve turned that opening into a path of growth. Your story shows how medication and CBT can work hand‑in‑hand, but the real engine has always been your willingness to push through discomfort. Keep celebrating those “tiny victories” (the Home‑Depot trip, the freeway drive, the park walk). They’re evidence that you’ve earned the right to move forward, even on down days. Stay connected with your therapist, keep a routine that balances exposure with rest, and consider a support group—whether online or local—to share the highs and the lows. Your progress is proof that you do have value, and that value extends to your children and the world. Keep going—you’ve got this.","

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice. Some strategies that people find helpful include establishing a calming Sunday routine to help ease the transition into the workweek. This could be anything from taking a relaxing bath, practicing mindfulness or meditation, or even engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Planning ahead for the week can also help, like organizing your tasks or meals, so you feel more in control. Additionally, try to focus on self-care activities that help reduce stress, such as exercise or spending time with loved ones. If the anxiety feels overwhelming, consider talking to a professional who can provide support and guidance tailored to your situation. Remember, it's important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that these feelings are valid.","

It sounds really challenging to have what should be a rest day become filled with such dread about the week ahead.

While I want to acknowledge the severity of what you're experiencing, I'm curious - what do you think is driving these intense feelings about returning to work? Sometimes understanding the root cause can help guide us to better coping strategies.

- Create Sunday routines that bring joy and distraction
- Prepare for Monday on Friday to reduce Sunday pressure
- Practice gentle self-care activities like light exercise or meditation
- Connect with others who understand these feelings

Given how severe your symptoms are, it may also be worth speaking with a mental health professional who can help develop personalized strategies. Your experience sounds really challenging and you deserve support in managing this.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: How do you guys deal with the “Sunday Scaries”?  I get pretty intense anxiety every Sunday knowing that I will have to go back to being a functioning member of society on Monday. I usually can’t eat and on really bad days will be vomiting from anxiety. What are some things that you guys do to deal with pre-workweek anxiety?.

Your response:
","You're describing a very common phenomenon, often referred to as the ""Sunday Blues."" It's great that you're acknowledging and seeking help for your anxiety. It sounds like the pressure of returning to work and the expectations that come with it are overwhelming for you.

One thing that might help is to establish a relaxing Sunday routine that signals to your brain that it's still a day of rest. This could be as simple as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing gentle stretches. By creating a calming atmosphere, you may be able to slow down your racing thoughts and reduce your anxiety.

It might also be helpful to challenge some of the negative thoughts that come up for you on Sundays. Ask yourself, ""Is there any evidence that Monday will be as bad as I'm imagining?"" or ""What are some things I'm looking forward to doing on Monday?"" Reframing your thoughts in a more positive light can help alleviate some of the anxiety.

Lastly, consider seeking support from a mental health professional who can help you develop coping strategies and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your anxiety.","

Your response:
","I hear how heavy the Sunday night can feel—like a looming deadline that’s not a project but a return to the regular grind. It’s normal to feel that surge of anxiety when the weekend’s last day turns into a “pre‑work‑week” ritual. Here are a few ideas that might help ease that transition:

1. **Schedule a “Sunday Night Wind‑Down”** – Pick one relaxing activity (reading, a warm bath, gentle yoga) and block the same time each Sunday. The ritual signals the brain that the weekend is still in session.

2. **Set a realistic “Monday Prep” list** – Write down three concrete, achievable tasks to tackle on Monday. Knowing exactly what you’ll tackle can turn vague dread into focused action.

3. **Create a “transition playlist”** – Put together music or podcasts that shift your mood from weekend to work mode. Listening as you wrap up can cue mental readiness.

4. **Practice a brief grounding exercise** – Five deep breaths, noticing sensations, or a quick body scan can calm the nervous system before you even leave the house.

5. **Limit screen time before bed** – The blue light and constant alerts can keep the brain in","

9jnop7,Anxiety,Today I ate in a restaurant by myself,tanbeef,"I’ve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I’ve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years.

I’ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought “fuck it” I’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate.

Also pacing myself and not caring if I finish or not.

Facing your fears head-on takes immense courage, especially when dealing with anxiety and a phobia as challenging as yours.

By pushing through the discomfort and completing your meal, you've proven to yourself that you're capable of confronting and managing your fears. It's important to celebrate these victories, no matter how small they might seem to others, because they represent real progress in your journey.

Remember to be gentle with yourself and acknowledge each step you take, whether big or small. It's this kind of resilience and determination that will continue to empower you to live life on your own terms. Keep building on this momentum, and know that you're not alone in this journey.","

Your response:
","Wow, what an incredible breakthrough moment you've shared! I can hear the mixture of emotions in your words - from the initial fear and anxiety you've battled for years, to this powerful moment of saying ""fuck it"" and choosing to face that fear head-on. It's especially touching how you describe it as ""overwhelmingly liberating"" - that really captures the weight of what you've been carrying and the freedom you felt in that moment.

Taking that step to eat alone in a restaurant might seem simple to some, but when you've been dealing with a specific phobia around choking and anxiety for years, this was truly an act of courage. The fact that you not only went in but also finished your entire meal is remarkable. You have every right to feel proud of yourself.

This feels like more than just a meal - it sounds like a moment where you reclaimed some control from your anxiety. Would you like to share what it was about today that made you feel ready to take this step?","

","That’s a huge, honest win—congratulations! 🎉 It sounds like you’ve been navigating anxiety and a choking‑phobia for years, and stepping into that restaurant alone was a bold move.

What you did today—ordering, sitting, and finishing the meal—shows both courage and resilience. It’s okay to feel emotional about it; that reaction is a sign that you’re breaking a long‑standing barrier.

Celebrate each success, no matter how small, and remember that progress isn’t linear. You’re proving to yourself that the fear doesn’t dictate your life. Keep honoring that courage, and lean on support when needed. You’ve earned this pride, and it’s only the first of many victories.","

7vrzcw,Anxiety,Does anyone else here always feel like they’re in some sort of trouble or someone is upset with them?,goodbyemylittlefrien,"I think one of the worse symptoms of my anxiety is that I often feel in “trouble” or like someone is upset with me. 

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. 

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?",974,162,1517962487,"Oh my God, yes. Especially the dread phrase, ""We need to talk.""",178,41mHL,"Oh my God, yes. Especially the dread phrase, ""We need to talk.""",178,41mHL,"It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of self-doubt and anxiety, especially in social situations or after a long day. It’s not uncommon for people with anxiety to replay the day’s events and worry about how they were perceived by others. This can be exhausting and overwhelming, particularly when it affects your ability to relax and sleep.

One approach to managing these feelings is to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to be perfect. It might also help to challenge your thoughts by asking yourself if there is concrete evidence that someone is upset with you, or if it’s just your anxiety speaking.

Mindfulness or relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can also be beneficial before bed to calm your mind. Lastly, consider talking to a therapist, who can provide you with strategies tailored to your needs and help you work through these feelings in a supportive environment. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and reaching out for support is a strong and positive step forward.","

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?.

Your response:
","I hear how distressing these constant feelings of being ""in trouble"" are for you, especially when they follow you home and disrupt your sleep. It's a heavy burden to carry that persistent worry about others' judgments and constantly second-guessing your actions.

You're definitely not alone in experiencing this. What you're describing is a common manifestation of anxiety - that nagging feeling that you've done something wrong even when there's no evidence to support it. It's like your mind gets stuck in a loop of reviewing and questioning every interaction.

While I can't give specific medical advice, many people find relief through:
- Writing down their worries to get them out of their head
- Practicing mindfulness to stay grounded in the present moment
- Reminding themselves that these feelings are anxiety symptoms, not reality
- Talking to trusted friends who can offer perspective

Have you considered speaking with a mental health professional? They can help you develop personalized strategies to manage these intrusive thoughts and break the cycle of worry.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're carrying around a sense of unease and self-doubt, and it's really affecting your daily life and sleep. I think many people can relate to feeling like they're walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's like you're constantly scanning your environment for potential threats or criticisms.

One thing that might help is to recognize that these feelings are often driven by your anxiety, rather than actual circumstances. When you start to feel like you're in trouble, try to take a step back and assess the situation objectively. Ask yourself if there's any evidence to support these feelings, or if they're just a product of your anxiety.

Another strategy might be to practice self-compassion and challenge those negative self-thoughts. Instead of beating yourself up over perceived mistakes, try to reframe them as opportunities for growth and learning. And when those anxious thoughts start to creep in at night, try to focus on relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help calm your mind and body.","

Your response:
","It’s not uncommon to feel that shadow of “someone’s watching” after a long day, especially when anxiety is on the rise. That internal voice—“Did I do enough?”—often jumps in right before you try to rest. A good first step is to pause the loop: when you notice the thought, label it (“That’s my anxiety talking”) and gently redirect with a grounding cue—count breaths, notice a physical sensation, or jot the thought down in a quick list.  

Try a short “end‑of‑day check‑in”: ask yourself one or two neutral questions (“What went well? What can I let go of?”) and write a brief answer. This turns rumination into a brief, intentional reflection.  

If the worry lingers into sleep, practice a simple body scan or a 5‑minute guided meditation to shift focus away from self‑critique. Over time, the brain learns that the day is finished, and the feeling of being in trouble fades. You’re not alone in this—many find relief by turning the mind’s chatter into","

m31qy4,Anxiety,Anyone feels like they live more in their head than in real life?,SirNatcelot,"So, I was wondering, anyone feel like this? 
I think I spend more time in my one head than in the real life. I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows. 
I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
Don’t get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn’t. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but I’m almost 22 years old now… and I don’t know if this is still a good thing.

Edit: Hey! I'm so so happy for all the support in the comments. I just wanted to say thank you to you all! This has been quite emotional for me, being able to see myself in others and the similar things we all live trough. Thank you all for being so amazing!",2026,120,1615499522,I’m 28 and am still like this. When they say “be your own best friend” I think I took it too far LOL.,311,Toasty-Toez,You have any heavy pieces placements in your chart ?? Lol but nah I’m the same way. I’ve read thousands of books since childhood. I’m always fantasizing too and I need my mind to be stimulated and fully distracted so as to avoid extreme overthinking and anxiety so I get it.,4,20JC20,"It sounds like you're experiencing a deep connection with your inner world, which can be both enriching and challenging. Many people find comfort in books, TV shows, and their imagination, as these offer a form of escape and a way to process emotions. It's not uncommon to feel more at ease in these spaces, especially when real life feels overwhelming.

Being empathetic and imagining how characters feel can be a strength, as it shows your capacity for understanding and connection. However, it's important to find a balance so that these escapes don't prevent you from engaging with real-life experiences and relationships.

You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s great to hear that the support from others has been meaningful to you. Consider exploring activities that ground you in the present, like mindfulness or connecting with others who share your interests. Remember, it’s okay to seek help or guidance if you feel stuck. Your journey towards finding balance is unique and valid.","

Your response:
","I hear how much comfort and refuge you find in these imaginary worlds, and it's completely understandable. It sounds like you're aware of the balance between fantasy and reality, but you're questioning whether this coping mechanism is still serving you well at this stage in your life.

The fact that you're reflecting on this shows real self-awareness. Many people, regardless of age, use imagination and stories as a way to process emotions and escape from life's difficulties. Your empathy and ability to deeply connect with characters can actually be a beautiful strength.

However, I sense some concern in your words about whether this might be becoming too much of an escape. Perhaps we could explore what makes real life feel ""extremely unpleasant"" most of the time? Sometimes when we find ourselves retreating frequently into our inner world, it can be a sign that something in our outer world needs attention or support.

You're not alone in this experience - many people struggle with finding the right balance between their rich inner life and external reality.","

","It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from reality, and you're using fantasy and media as a way to cope with the difficulties of real life. It's completely understandable that you'd want to escape into more pleasant worlds, especially when you feel like life is unpleasant more often than not.

I think it's great that you're aware of the distinction between reality and fantasy, and that you're not losing yourself completely in these imaginary worlds. However, it's also important to address the underlying issues that might be causing you to feel this way. It's possible that there are things in your life that you can change or work on to make it more enjoyable and fulfilling.

","It sounds like you’re very much in tune with your inner world, and that’s a gift—especially your empathy for characters and people. Many of us spend a lot of time “inside our heads,” especially in our twenties when life feels uncertain and the external world can feel a bit ungrounded. It’s normal to use books, shows, or daydreams as a safe space, but if it’s starting to feel like you’re missing out on everyday life or that the real world feels unpleasant, it might help to find small ways to bridge the two.

Try setting a short “real‑life” ritual—like a walk, a workout, or a creative hobby—followed by a brief period of reading or a show. Jotting down what you feel in each space can also help you notice how they complement each other. If the feeling of disconnection grows, talking to a counselor could be a supportive next step. You’re not alone, and it’s okay","

Your response:
","I hear how deeply these confrontational moments affect you, and how they keep replaying in your mind long after they've happened. It sounds particularly challenging because even when you acknowledge a mistake on your part, like the laughing incident, the aggressive response still feels overwhelming and stays with you.

Given your history with social anxiety, it makes sense that these interactions would hit especially hard. It's like these moments trigger something deeper than just the immediate situation - they seem to tap into a more vulnerable place that makes it difficult to just ""shake it off"" like others might.

Would you say there's a part of you that's frustrated because you feel you should be able to handle these situations better by now, especially since you've overcome other aspects of your social anxiety? It sounds really isolating to carry these feelings around while trying to function normally in your daily life.","

Expert reasoning dialog:

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day  For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.
Thanks for reading !

","It sounds like you're carrying around a sense of guilt and responsibility for the other person's emotions, even when it's not your fault. You mentioned that you realized later that your laughter was disrespectful, and that realization seems to be weighing heavily on you. It's also clear that you're frustrated with how long it takes you to shake off these interactions. 

It might be helpful to explore the idea that you can't control how others react, but you can control how you respond to them. When someone is aggressive or mean, it's not uncommon for the person on the receiving end to feel anxious or stuck. However, it's also possible that you're putting too much stock in the other person's behavior, and not enough in your own reactions and boundaries. 

It's interesting that you mention having severe social anxiety in the past, but this issue persisted even after that resolved. It might be worth exploring whether there are any underlying patterns or fears that are contributing to your continued sensitivity to aggressive behavior.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy emotional load that’s spilling into every part of the day. When someone reacts aggressively—especially when you feel you’re not at fault—it can feel like a personal attack, and that lingering anxiety can hijack your thoughts.

Try a quick “ground‑ing” routine right after the incident: pause, take three slow breaths, and label the feeling (“I’m upset, I’m anxious”). Then ask yourself a gentle question: “What evidence do I have that I’m in danger or that I’m at fault?” Often the answer is “none.” Reframe the situation: “This person was angry, not me.” Repeating this can slowly dislodge the automatic “I’m bad” loop.
