z095pe,AITAH,AITA for wearing jeans to my daughter's wedding?,BallFinal2037," My (52F) daughter (24F) has always been a sloppy dresser. She has never dressed up well when we go to nice restaurants or family parties, and only wore dresses or nicer coats instead of her usual outfit consisting of hoodies and jeans when we asked her several times. I have always found her constant failure to dress nicely for us selfish, yet she refuses to see it as we do and does not see the issue with her behavior.

When she was 17, we had gone to a restaurant for my birthday and she had worn jeans, a T-shirt and a long jacket that she had only worn when she was asked to. The next day, she dressed up in a skirt and sweater and overall, a much nicer and more appropriate outfit to see her boyfriend without being asked to, and I was upset that she'd extend this courtesy to her boyfriend but not me. I had told her off for it before she left but she was confused and did not see how selfish she had been.

Last week, she married the same boy and I had decided to let her see what it felt like to be seen as less of a priority on an occasion that is important to her, so without telling her I arrived at her wedding in jeans and a blouse instead of my prepared outfit. However, at the wedding I was shocked to see that my daughter did not seem to take issue with this. She did not comment on my attire once throughout the day and has still been in the same level of contact with me yet has not mentioned or seemed to have cared. My husband, however, is angry at me, as he had tried to discourage me from swapping my outfit to a casual one and now is telling me that I had embarrassed him with my attire and that as mother of the bride I should have been more considerate of how it made him look to stand next to me. I, however, thought he had agreed with me that our daughter's behavior was selfish and that this is nothing compared to the years of her refusing to put in the effort to dress nicely for us.",2037,1217,1668963682,"Ma'am, you grown. This is a beyond petty thing you decided to do at your own daughters wedding. Thank goodness your daughter clearly does not care how you look or what you wear. Even if you are ugly on the inside. YTA.",655,cocoaiswithme,You are holding grudges for 7+ years because a kid did not dress up for your 45th birthday? You are patetic🤦🏻‍♀️,382,Few-Carpet9511,"It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and hurt by what you perceive as a lack of consideration from your daughter regarding her attire over the years. It’s understandable that these feelings might drive you to make a statement at her wedding. However, weddings are often seen as a time for celebration and unity, and your decision to dress casually may have inadvertently shifted attention away from that. 

Your husband’s reaction suggests that he sees the situation differently, perhaps viewing the day as an opportunity to support your daughter rather than address past grievances. It’s possible that your daughter didn’t comment on your attire because her focus was on the joy of her wedding day rather than on appearances.

This could be an opportunity to reflect on whether there may be other ways to address your feelings with your daughter. Open and honest communication about how her choices have made you feel might bring more understanding than actions intended to mirror perceived slights.","

Your response:
","Let me be direct but compassionate here: Your actions seem to stem from long-held resentment over your daughter's clothing choices, and you attempted to ""teach her a lesson"" on her wedding day. However, this appears to have backfired and only damaged your own dignity and your husband's experience of this special day.

The fact that your daughter didn't react suggests either she's matured beyond letting clothing choices affect her relationships, or she's learned to manage her expectations of you. Either way, wearing jeans to your daughter's wedding didn't achieve your intended goal of making her feel hurt or less prioritized - it only reflected poorly on you.

This situation might be worth reflecting on: Why do you feel so strongly about your daughter's past clothing choices that you'd risk compromising such an important family moment? Perhaps the issue isn't really about clothing at all, but about feeling respected and valued by your daughter. I'd encourage you to consider seeking family counseling to address these deeper feelings rather than expressing them through potentially harmful actions.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated and confused by your daughter's reaction to your outfit at her wedding. On one hand, you had expected her to be upset or at least acknowledge the fact that you wore jeans, but instead, she didn't seem to care. This might have left you feeling a bit disappointed or even unheard.

At the same time, you also mention that your husband is upset with you, feeling embarrassed by your outfit and thinking that you should have been more considerate of how it made him look. This might be adding to your feelings of uncertainty and frustration.

It seems like there's a deeper issue here, one that goes beyond just your outfit at the wedding. You've mentioned feeling hurt and frustrated by your daughter's past behavior, feeling like she prioritizes others over you when it comes to dressing up. This might be something that's worth exploring further, rather than just focusing on the wedding outfit.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of hurt from years of feeling overlooked, and you’re trying to make a point at a moment that matters most to your daughter. The wedding is her day, and while you’re right to want respect, the dress code for a mother of the bride is usually a cue from the couple’s wishes—formal, semi‑formal, or whatever they set. Your jeans and blouse probably didn’t match the theme, but the fact that your daughter didn’t comment suggests she was focused on her marriage and perhaps didn’t let the choice of a parent’s outfit derail her celebration. Your husband’s reaction is understandable; he’s worried about how you present yourselves together. Maybe next time discuss dress expectations with both the bride and your partner before the big day—so you feel respected and your husband feels reassured.","

It can be tough when you feel like your partner isn't respecting your wishes, especially when you've communicated them clearly. It might help to consider why your girlfriend continues to buy you gifts despite knowing your feelings. Sometimes, people express love and care in ways they are familiar with, and gift-giving could be her way of showing affection. It might be worth having a calm conversation with her about this. Explain how her actions make you feel and why it's important to you to celebrate the holiday differently. Try to understand her perspective as well; maybe there's a compromise or alternative way to celebrate together that honors both your preferences. Communication and understanding can go a long way in resolving these kinds of conflicts.","

Your response:
","I hear how intensely frustrated you are about this situation. It seems like you've been very clear about your boundaries regarding gifts, especially at Christmas, and feeling completely unheard after 4 years must be incredibly maddening. While your girlfriend likely has good intentions and may be expressing love through gift-giving, she's repeatedly disregarding your clearly stated wishes, which feels like a violation of your boundaries.

Rather than judging whether you're ""the asshole,"" it might be more helpful to explore why this triggers such a strong emotional response in you, and why it's so important to your girlfriend to give gifts despite your objections. This seems like it could be about more than just the presents - perhaps about feeling respected and understood in the relationship.

Have you had a chance to explain to her not just that you don't want gifts, but why it upsets you so deeply? Understanding each other's underlying motivations might help bridge this gap.","

","It sounds like you’re feeling both hurt and frustrated—valid emotions when someone repeatedly ignores a clear boundary. You’ve told her “I hate gifts” and “I don’t need them,” yet she’s still ordering items you dislike. That persistence can feel like a lack of respect for your wishes, especially after four years together. It’s not “shaking mad”; it’s understandable anger. You might try a calm, specific conversation: outline exactly what you’re comfortable with (e.g., no gifts, a small token, or a homemade card), and ask her to honor that. If she continues, it may be worth reflecting on whether her actions align with the mutual respect you’re striving for. Your feelings matter, and setting clear boundaries is healthy.","

zj9m45,AITAH,AITA: For giving my daughter a barbie dream house from “Santa”,r3DD1tr3adings,"So I, (33, F) and my husband (35, M) have a set of twins (7 M and F). 

We both have high paying jobs and really try to be the best parents we can be to our kids.

Well recently, my sister came over while my husband took the kids and my nieces and nephew to a fun house. 

My sister and her husband are both lower class. They are amazing parents but can’t afford to get their kids very extravagant toys all of the time.

The topic got into christmas and we started talking about what we got everyone. When it got to me to tell what i got for my kids, I showed her the gifts that were already wrapped.

I wanna put in that my kids do believe in Santa still, so I put some gifts with the label “Santa”.

My sister pointed out the big pink present with the Santa label and asked what it was. 

I told her it was a barbie dream house my daughter had been asking for.

She made a sour face and said I need to change the label of the gift because her kids and many others wouldn’t be getting gifts like that from Santa.

I didn’t really understand what she meant so I told her I wouldn’t be changing anything.

She got defensive and said I was wrong because kids that are less fortunate won’t be getting expensive gifts for Santa, and it will make them and the parents feel bad.

But still, I stuck with my decision because I didn’t see anything wrong with it.

She got mad and left my house. When my husband came back home he put the kids down for a nap and I explained the situation to him. 

He said he understood were she was coming from because kids that come from less fortunate family’s won’t be getting barbie dream houses from Santa.

He said I should change it but he won’t be mad or upset if I don’t. My sister went to family about it and people are telling me that I need to change the label so my nieces don’t get jealous.

But I don’t see an issue..so AITA?",234,249,1670793761,"NAH. I understand both views. I understand you want to let your kids have the magic of the season, but imagine your kid going to school saying Santa got her this massive gift while another student got socks. Imagine that kid going home to ask her mom why Santa doesn’t love her too? Maybe label the less expensive gifts from Santa and the big items from you.",266,Agoraphobe961,"I think you *should* change the labels now that that she’s expressed a frustration that she has to deal with, since you can easily be part of the solution. Not all parents can afford a Barbie dream house, and kids of parents who can’t give generous Santa gifts can feel like they weren’t as good or Santa is mad at them or something. Having the Barbie dream house be from you and having some smaller gifts be from Santa is more fair.

That said, it’s your house and your family. You can do whatever you want, but it’s not unreasonable for them to ask. 

Also… why are the Santa presents out this early? Shouldn’t they only come out on Christmas Eve if your kids believe in Santa?

ETA verdict: NAH",6,thetinymole,"Navigating the balance between creating a magical experience for your children and being sensitive to the feelings of others can be challenging. It sounds like you truly cherish the joy of giving and want to make Christmas special for your kids. At the same time, your sister’s perspective highlights a broader issue that many families face. The idea that Santa’s gifts reflect each family’s financial situation can indeed create disparities among children, potentially leading to confusion or feelings of inadequacy.

One approach could be to have a conversation with your daughter about the spirit of giving and perhaps attribute the more extravagant gifts to you and your husband. This doesn't diminish the magic of Santa but helps manage expectations and fosters an understanding of gratitude and generosity. Ultimately, your intention as a parent is to do what feels right for your family, while also being empathetic to your sister’s concerns. By considering these dynamics, you can find a balance that honors both your family traditions and the feelings of those around you.","

I wanna put in that my kids do believe in Santa still, so I put some gifts with the label “Santa”.

My sister pointed out the big pink present with the Santa label and asked what it was. 

I told her it was a barbie dream house my daughter had been asking for.

She made a sour face and said I need to change the label of the gift because her kids and many others wouldn’t be getting gifts like that from Santa.

I didn’t really understand what she meant so I told her I wouldn’t be changing anything.

She got defensive and said I was wrong because kids that are less fortunate won’t be getting expensive gifts for Santa, and it will make them and the parents feel bad.

But still, I stuck with my decision because I didn’t see anything wrong with it.

She got mad and left my house. When my husband came back home he put the kids down for a nap and I explained the situation to him. 

He said he understood were she was coming from because kids that come from less fortunate family’s won’t be getting barbie dream houses from Santa.

He said I should change it but he won’t be mad or upset if I don’t. My sister went to family about it and people are telling me that I need to change the label so my nieces don’t get jealous.

But I don’t see an issue..so AITA?.

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy while addressing the core issue:

I understand you want to create magical Christmas memories for your daughter, and there's nothing wrong with giving her wonderful gifts. However, your sister raises a valid point about the ""Santa"" label on expensive presents that many families can't afford. When children compare their Santa gifts at school or with cousins, it can create confusion and hurt - why would Santa give expensive gifts to some kids but not others?

Consider this: Your daughter will love the dream house just as much coming from you and your husband. You can still keep the magic of Santa alive with smaller gifts while taking credit for the bigger ones as parents. This approach shows sensitivity to other families while maintaining the joy of gift-giving.

This isn't about judging your generosity - it's about being mindful of how ""Santa gifts"" impact the wider community of children who still believe. Perhaps this is an opportunity to teach your children about gratitude and understanding different families' circumstances.

What do you think about keeping Santa's gifts more modest while giving the dream house as a special gift from Mom and Dad?","

Your response:
","You seem to be genuinely perplexed by the reaction of your sister and other family members. It sounds like you're coming from a place of wanting to make your daughter happy, which is understandable. However, it's also possible that your sister's concerns about the potential impact on less fortunate children might be worth considering.

It's not about you being 'wrong' or 'bad,' but rather about being sensitive to the feelings of others, especially children who may not have the same opportunities as your own. Your sister's point is that labeling an expensive gift as being from 'Santa' might inadvertently create unrealistic expectations or feelings of disappointment for children who don't receive similar gifts.

It's worth considering having an open conversation with your daughter about the value of gifts and the spirit of giving, rather than just focusing on the label. This might help you find a middle ground that works for everyone involved.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to keep your daughter’s magic alive and feeling put on the spot by your sister’s comment. You didn’t intend to hurt anyone—just wanted to give your daughter something she asked for. Your husband’s perspective helps: he sees the gesture as personal, not a commentary on other kids’ gifts. The concern from your sister and others is really about fairness and how the gift might affect the other children’s expectations. A quick compromise could ease the tension: keep the “Santa” label but maybe add a note like “From Santa, with love” and tell your niece that Santa brings many different gifts, some small, some big, just like your own family. That way you preserve the magic for your daughter and address the jealousy worry without changing the gift itself. It’s a gentle middle ground that respects everyone’s feelings.","

y1noss,AITAH,AITA for calling my 8 year old nephew a psychopath to his mothers face?,WeiPatriarch,"  I (17 F) babysit my nephew 5 days a week for 7 hours and don’t get payed for it. It is expected of me as his aunt and as the older person. However, these last few months my nephew (8 M) has begun to act very strange. He has started screaming at me, demanding things from me and hitting or kicking me when he doesn’t get his way. When I asked his mother about this, she admitted she told him that since I wasn’t an adult he doesn’t have to do what I tell him. I told her that doesn’t make sense considering I babysit him alone for multiple hours 5 days a week, and how am I supposed to take care of him if he doesn’t consider me an adult and doesn’t listen to me? 

Well last night was the last straw for me. It was 7 pm at night and my parents had to work late and his mother hadn’t come to pick him up yet. He came up to me demanding that I let him eat the slice of cake that I had bought for myself earlier that day. I told him no and said his mother would be here soon and they would eat dinner together. He threw an absolute FIT at that. Screaming, crying, hitting me. Then, when I told him no again, he ran up to my 3 months old Boston terrier puppy and kicked him as hard as he could. That was when everything went red for me. I grabbed him by his arm and dragged him out of the house and locked him out. His mother finally arrived two minutes later to find him sobbing outside locked out and called me screaming. She asked why I had locked a child out of the house. I told her what happened and she told me that he was “just a kid” and “didn’t know any better”. I told her I could put up with him hitting me, but if he ever touched my puppy again I would slap him. She said I was crazy and abusive for thinking like that and I told her that her son was a psycho and I will not be babysitting him anymore. Both my parents and his mother are furious at me but I don’t feel guilty in the least bit. So AITA?

Calling your nephew a ""psychopath"" might have been an emotional reaction in the moment, but it’s crucial to focus on the behavior rather than labeling him. It might be helpful to have a calm conversation with his mother about setting clear boundaries and expectations for both your roles. Also, discussing your concerns with your parents could help to establish a more supportive environment and ensure everyone understands the gravity of the situation. You’re not wrong for wanting to protect yourself and your puppy, but finding a collaborative way forward could be beneficial for all involved.","

Your response:
","I understand your frustration and anger, especially regarding the puppy's safety. However, calling an 8-year-old a psychopath isn't helpful and could be harmful. The real issue here seems to be a combination of his mother undermining your authority, lack of boundaries, and potential behavioral problems that need professional attention.

It's concerning that you're expected to provide unpaid childcare for 35 hours weekly while also working weekend shifts. This situation isn't fair to you or your nephew. His aggressive behavior and his mother's dismissal of it are red flags that need addressing.

I suggest:
1. Firmly declining to continue babysitting without proper authority and respect
2. Discussing with your parents about the unreasonable expectations
3. Encouraging your sister/sister-in-law to seek professional help for your nephew's behavioral issues

While your reaction was understandable, especially regarding protecting your puppy, locking a child outside wasn't safe. In the future, it would be better to immediately contact his mother or your parents when his behavior becomes unmanageable.

You're not the asshole for being upset, but the situation needs a more constructive solution.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling extremely frustrated and overwhelmed by your situation with your nephew. On one hand, you're expected to care for him for 7 hours a day without pay, and on the other hand, his mother is undermining your authority by telling him he doesn't have to listen to you. That must be very challenging for you.

I can understand why the incident with your puppy was the final straw for you. It's reasonable that you want to protect your pet from harm. However, using the term 'psychopath' to describe an 8-year-old child might not be the most constructive or accurate way to address the situation. Children at that age often struggle with impulse control and may behave in ways that are not acceptable.

It's also worth considering that your nephew's behavior might be a reflection of the lack of boundaries and discipline in his life, rather than a personal failing. I'm not saying that excuses his behavior, but it might be helpful to have a more nuanced conversation with his mother about how to address these issues together.

In terms of whether you're in the wrong, it's not entirely clear-cut. While your reaction might have been intense, it's understandable that you felt the need to protect your pet and set boundaries. However, it's also important to consider whether there are more constructive ways to address the situation and work with your nephew's mother to find a solution that works for everyone.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a real emotional bind—expecting to be the “adult” caretaker, while he’s behaving like he isn’t, and then hitting you and a puppy. That’s enough to make anyone feel angry and unsafe. Calling him a “psychopath” feels like you’re cutting him off emotionally; it’s a harsh label that probably doesn’t help the situation.  

You did set a boundary—no cake, no puppy contact—and you reacted when he broke it. Locking him out is a strong move; it’s understandable if you feared further harm","

ywefto,AITAH,AITA for being upset at my best friend because she didn’t make me maid of honor?,-heavily-distressed-,"*OP deleted the post, I am not the original poster*

I (26F) have three best friends: Jake (27M), Nancy (27F) and Kara (26F). We have been a friend group since 9th grade, but I met them in different moments of my life: I met Kara at ballet class at 3, Jake in middle school at 11, and Nancy through Kara. We all love each other like siblings, if not more. After graduation the four of us all took different directions. Nancy studied in another city, Jake and I moved to two different states, Kara stayed in our state. We all stayed in contact and remained best friends, but we couldn’t see each other often. 

Three months ago, Kara called us back home for an emergency. When we reunited  Kara announced that she was getting married to Steve (30M), her boyfriend of 5 years. Now, Kara has always been the deadly combination between a hopeless romantic and someone that programs things extremely early, and she’s been programming her wedding since she was 15, pretty much like Monica Geller, so to the group it was spectacular news.

Kara is getting married December 2023. We’re all back home for two weeks, and this is when I discovered who Kara chose as maid of honor: Nancy, and I would’ve been one of her bridesmaids. This was a smack in the face to me.

Kara and I couldn’t be more different: she loves physical touch, I can’t stand it; she always had her life planned, I don’t know what I’ll do in an hour; she always wanted to get married and have kids, I can’t stand the idea of both marriage and motherhood; she’s Catholic, I’m an atheist. The list gos on and on, but this never made us any less close. We’ve always been there for each other, Kara is a treasure and we love each other, but as much as we do, I knew I wasn’t going to be her first best friend anymore when she met Nancy.

Kara and Nancy met at church when we had just started 8th grade. They were both Harry Potter fans, had the same color and phone model, were born one day apart and one year apart, had the same interests and many other stuff. Nancy immediately became Kara’s 1st best friend.

During our high school years Kara had become clingy and logorrheic at school, and two of three times it happened that I blew up in her face and said hurtful things I didn’t mean. I immediately apologized after those episodes. Nancy never was like that with Kara, in fact I’m 95% sure they never argued in almost 15 years of friendship. I admit I wasn’t the best friend to have around, but I had my own stuff on my mind, and I never really thought about how I behaved with Kara. I loved Kara dearly, but sometimes I needed breaks from her. She wouldn’t shut up about her dream job, dream man, dream wedding, future kids, future house etc. I just sat there, zoned out, while Nancy listened to all her rants and inserted herself and her future children in Kara’s day dreams.

After graduation we all moved far except for Kara, and Nancy was close enough to still visit on weekends so they got closer. Jake and I couldn’t. During that time I felt nostalgic of the days I spent with Kara never stopping from talking. I felt lonely, and I became clingy towards her during phone calls. I really missed her, and the fact she chose Nancy upset me. I had never realized how much Kara mattered to me.

Last week we were reunited to help Kara and Steve with wedding stuff, which is when Kara told me she chose Nancy as her MoH. I asked her why she didn’t choose me, and she said that I never got confirmation and I’m atheist, so I can’t be a maid of honor in the Catholic rite. 

I got silent and cold after that. It wasn’t until the evening that Kara confronted me about what was bothering me. I tried to say deny something was wrong, but she kept pushing, so I just exploded in front of the others too. I admitted that I was upset for not being chosen as MoH, and that I couldn’t believe she chose someone she knew for 15 years over someone she’s known for 23, the person aside her relatives that saw her grow up. Kara immediately defended herself and said that she didn’t want to burden me with wedding stuff she knows I dislike, and that making me maid of honor was impossible due to the Catholic rite and she could never ask me to take a sacrament if I didn’t have faith in. I spat back that if she cared about me she would’ve found a way, and that she shouldn’t make up excuses since her perfect wedding was already planned back when she was an obnoxious and stupid girl who couldn’t shut up to save her life, and Nancy being the MoH was the plan all along. I said many other hurtful things I don’t remember. It was only when I was done that I realized I had exploded like when I was a teen, just three times worse. I looked at Kara and she looked like she was about to cry. She excused herself and left. Silence fell. Nancy ran after her. I tried to go too but Steve stopped me and asked me to leave for the rest of the night.

Jake came back to our hotel room two hours later. He told me Nancy had stayed with Kara to comfort her, and that Steve was furious. Jake told me that I should’ve handled things differently and immediately talk to him or Nancy over how she felt instead of keeping everything inside and then exploding. He told me that although he validates my feelings, it’s not a good excuse to blow up in Kara’s face like that when she’s doing the best she can to organize the wedding on her own. He told me that he had the same reaction at the beginning because of the church’s restrictions over atheists, but he had resigned himself and was cool with being a groomsman as long as Kara was happy.

This morning I got a call from Steve, telling me that Kara is really upset and that it’s better if I spend today away from the wedding preparations and see what happens tomorrow.

I love Kara with my whole heart and I never wanted to be the person who hurt her, especially playing over her insecurities. I feel awful for blowing up at her, but at the same time I feel like nobody cares about my point of view on the matter and everyone wants to act good for Kara. I need to know, who’s the asshole here? What can I do?


EDIT:
There are some things I should clarify:
- we’re not Americans
- the majority of my country’s population is Catholic, so it’s hard to have an atheist MoH or BM in the Catholic rite
- since we were teens, Kara talked about how she wanted me, Nancy and Jake as MoHs and BM, and if it wasn’t possible having 3 (it’s always 2) either me or Jake would’ve been the other MoH or BM. We couldn’t be both MoH and BM because she and Nancy already promised to be each other’s MoH. I thought it was just a promise between teens and that they wouldn’t have kept it, which is why I was surprised.
- I don’t find her dreams stupid, but they’re not what I would do for myself. I admit, I called her stupid because she was insecure at school, me having straight As and her having problems with some subjects that I helped her with. I’m already beating myself up for saying it dw",216,237,1668558340,"YTA, a HUGE AH!!!!

How dare you?!?! It’s KARA’S WEDDING!! Being the MoH is huge but you don’t check some of the required boxes in order to qualify but because you’re JEALOUS of Kara and Nancy’s relationship you think Kara should’ve tried to make you MoH. You should feel lucky Kara is still your friend. You didn’t really act like one in the past, and she and Nancy had/have more in common. Be happy you’re still a bridesmaid and invited to the wedding. If you have a grain of love for your friendship with your best friends, apologize to both Kara and Nancy.",162,LoudlyQuietScream,"This was obviously written by the bride to be from the perspective of the ""Friend"". Probably to show her that everyone agrees the brides friend an asshole. 
Is the only way this would be worded this way. It's the only way the backstory makes sense. And the only way to explain a friend this clueless and so clearly the asshole.",3,Sosuperbad,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and your feelings are valid. It's understandable to feel hurt and left out, especially when you have a long history with Kara. However, it's important to recognize that Kara's decision might not have been intended to hurt you but rather was a reflection of her circumstances and beliefs. 

From what you've shared, it seems like your reaction was fueled by long-standing emotions and perhaps feeling sidelined in the friendship. It's commendable that you recognize you may have overreacted, and it’s a good step that you're reflecting on your actions. 

Consider reaching out to Kara with a heartfelt apology, acknowledging your outburst and the pain it may have caused. Express your love and support for her, and let her know that you value your friendship deeply. It might also help to have an open conversation about your feelings with Jake and Nancy to better understand their perspectives.

Remember, friendships can be mended with honest communication and empathy. It's never too late to make amends and move forward together.","

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy while being direct: YTA (you're the asshole) in this situation, but it comes from a place of deep hurt and unresolved feelings. Your reaction reveals how much you care about Kara, but the way you expressed it was harmful.

Throughout your story, there's a pattern of dismissing Kara's interests and personality (""obnoxious,"" ""couldn't shut up,"" zoning out during her excitement about her future). Yet you expect to be chosen as MoH based on length of friendship alone, despite knowing her religious beliefs are important to her and that there are legitimate Catholic ceremony restrictions.

The healthier approach would have been to:
1. Express your hurt feelings privately and calmly
2. Acknowledge that her religious beliefs are valid
3. Focus on supporting her special day rather than making it about your feelings

I suggest apologizing sincerely to Kara, acknowledging the hurt you caused, and asking how you can make things right. Remember, being a good friend means supporting their happiness, even when their choices differ from what we'd prefer.","

Your response:
","You sound torn between feeling hurt and validated by your reaction, and also deeply regretful for blowing up at Kara. On one hand, you feel like your feelings aren't being considered, and everyone is prioritizing Kara's happiness. On the other hand, you acknowledge that your outburst was hurtful and not the best way to handle your emotions.

It's understandable that you're upset about not being chosen as maid of honor, especially given your long history with Kara. However, it's also important to acknowledge Kara's perspective and the fact that she chose Nancy for reasons that go beyond just their friendship. The Catholic rite and her desire not to burden you with something that might make you uncomfortable are valid reasons that shouldn't be dismissed.

Rather than focusing on who's the ""asshole"" here, it might be more helpful to explore ways to repair your relationship with Kara and have an open and honest conversation about your feelings. It's clear that you love and care about Kara deeply, and she feels the same way about you. Taking the time to reflect on your actions and having a calm and empathetic conversation with Kara might be the first step towards healing and moving forward.","

Jake came back to our hotel room two hours later. He told me Nancy had stayed with Kara to comfort her, and that Steve was furious. Jake told me that I should’ve handled things differently and immediately talk to him or Nancy over how she felt instead of keeping everything inside and then exploding. He told me that although he validates my feelings, it’s not a good excuse to blow up in Kara’s face like that when she’s doing the best she can to organize the wedding on her own. He told me that he had the same reaction at the beginning because of the church’s restrictions over atheists, but he had resigned himself and was cool with being a groomsman as long as Kara was happy.

This morning I got a call from Steve, telling me that Kara is really upset and that it’s better if I spend today away from the wedding preparations and see what happens tomorrow.

I love Kara with my whole heart and I never wanted to be the person who hurt her, especially playing over her insecurities. I feel awful for blowing up at her, but at the same time I feel like nobody cares about my point of view on the matter and everyone wants to act good for Kara. I need to know, who’s the asshole here? What can I do?


EDIT:
There are some things I should clarify:
- we’re not Americans
- the majority of my country’s population is Catholic, so it’s hard to have an atheist MoH or BM in the Catholic rite
- since we were teens, Kara talked about how she wanted me, Nancy and Jake as MoHs and BM, and if it wasn’t possible having 3 (it’s always 2) either me or Jake would’ve been the other MoH or BM. We couldn’t be both MoH and BM because she and Nancy already promised to be each other’s MoH. I thought it was just a promise between teens and that they wouldn’t have kept it, which is why I was surprised.
- I don’t find her dreams stupid, but they’re not what I would do for myself. I admit, I called her stupid because she was insecure at school, me having straight As and her having problems with some subjects that I helped her with. I’m already beating myself up for saying it dw.

Your response:
","I hear you’re hurting and feel blindsided—being left out of something that feels so personal can sting. You’re not wrong to feel disappointed, but the way the anger exploded probably pushed Kara further away. The Catholic rite is a real constraint—most churches won’t allow a non‑believer to serve as maid of honor, so Kara had to choose someone who could fulfill that role. That doesn’t erase the fact that you’ve been a long‑","

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for being upset at my best friend because she didn’t make me maid of honor?  *OP deleted the post, I am not the original poster*

I (26F) have three best friends: Jake (27M), Nancy (27F) and Kara (26F). We have been a friend group since 9th grade, but I met them in different moments of my life: I met Kara at ballet class at 3, Jake in middle school at 11, and Nancy through Kara. We all love each other like siblings, if not more. After graduation the four of us all took different directions. Nancy studied in another city, Jake and I moved to two different states, Kara stayed in our state. We all stayed in contact and remained best friends, but we couldn’t see each other often. 

Three months ago, Kara called us back home for an emergency. When we reunited  Kara announced that she was getting married to Steve (30M), her boyfriend of 5 years. Now, Kara has always been the deadly combination between a hopeless romantic and someone that programs things extremely early, and she’s been programming her wedding since she was 15, pretty much like Monica Geller, so to the group it was spectacular news.

Kara is getting married December 2023. We’re all back home for two weeks, and this is when I discovered who Kara chose as maid of honor: Nancy, and I would’ve been one of her bridesmaids. This was a smack in the face to me.

Kara and I couldn’t be more different: she loves physical touch, I can’t stand it; she always had her life planned, I don’t know what I’ll do in an hour; she always wanted to get married and have kids, I can’t stand the idea of both marriage and motherhood; she’s Catholic, I’m an atheist. The list gos on and on, but this never made us any less close. We’ve always been there for each other, Kara is a treasure and we love each other, but as much as we do, I knew I wasn’t going to be her first best friend anymore when she met Nancy.

Kara and Nancy met at church when we had just started 8th grade. They were both Harry Potter fans, had the same color and phone model, were born one day apart and one year apart, had the same interests and many other stuff. Nancy immediately became Kara’s 1st best friend.

During our high school years Kara had become clingy and logorrheic at school, and two of three times it happened that I blew up in her face and said hurtful things I didn’t mean. I immediately apologized after those episodes. Nancy never was like that with Kara, in fact I’m 95% sure they never argued in almost 15 years of friendship. I admit I wasn’t the best friend to have around, but I had my own stuff on my mind, and I never really thought about how I behaved with Kara. I loved Kara dearly, but sometimes I needed breaks from her. She wouldn’t shut up about her dream job, dream man, dream wedding, future kids, future house etc. I just sat there, zoned out, while Nancy listened to all her rants and inserted herself and her future children in Kara’s day dreams.

After graduation we all moved far except for Kara, and Nancy was close enough to still visit on weekends so they got closer. Jake and I couldn’t. During that time I felt nostalgic of the days I spent with Kara never stopping from talking. I felt lonely, and I became clingy towards her during phone calls. I really missed her, and the fact she chose Nancy upset me. I had never realized how much Kara mattered to me.

Last week we were reunited to help Kara and Steve with wedding stuff, which is when Kara told me she chose Nancy as her MoH. I asked her why she didn’t choose me, and she said that I never got confirmation and I’m atheist, so I can’t be a maid of honor in the Catholic rite. 

I got silent and cold after that. It wasn’t until the evening that Kara confronted me about what was bothering me. I tried to say deny something was wrong, but she kept pushing, so I just exploded in front of the others too. I admitted that I was upset for not being chosen as MoH, and that I couldn’t believe she chose someone she knew for 15 years over someone she’s known for 23, the person aside her relatives that saw her grow up. Kara immediately defended herself and said that she didn’t want to burden me with wedding stuff she knows I dislike, and that making me maid of honor was impossible due to the Catholic rite and she could never ask me to take a sacrament if I didn’t have faith in. I spat back that if she cared about me she would’ve found a way, and that she shouldn’t make up excuses since her perfect wedding was already planned back when she was an obnoxious and stupid girl who couldn’t shut up to save her life, and Nancy being the MoH was the plan all along. I said many other hurtful things I don’t remember. It was only when I was done that I realized I had exploded like when I was a teen, just three times worse. I looked at Kara and she looked like she was about to cry. She excused herself and left. Silence fell. Nancy ran after her. I tried to go too but Steve stopped me and asked me to leave for the rest of the night.

Jake came back to our hotel room two hours later. He told me Nancy had stayed with Kara to comfort her, and that Steve was furious. Jake told me that I should’ve handled things differently and immediately talk to him or Nancy over how she felt instead of keeping everything inside and then exploding.

I’ve been divorced and was with another like that - so can confirm this by experience. Also, anything that is annoying before marriage WILL be an actual issue in marriage unless it’s fully resolved beforehand.",3,dorabsnot,info: Did you ask him why he left? Does he have social anxiety or not like big crowds?,1,Valuable_Ad_742,"It sounds like you're feeling hurt and disappointed by your boyfriend's actions at the graduation ceremony. It's understandable to want your partner to be more involved and supportive during important events. You're expressing a need for your boyfriend to engage more with your social circle and be present in moments that are meaningful to you. When he didn't see anything wrong with his actions, it likely heightened your frustration and led you to ask for a break.

Taking a break can be a way to gain perspective and evaluate what you both need from the relationship. It's important to communicate openly about your feelings and expectations. If you both decide to continue the relationship, discussing how you can both meet each other's needs might help strengthen your connection. Remember, it's okay to express when you're feeling unsupported, and seeking clarity on your relationship is a step towards understanding and growth.","

Your response:
","I hear how hurt and disappointed you're feeling about this situation. It seems like this graduation event brought up deeper feelings about wanting your boyfriend to be more involved in your social life and to support you during important moments. The fact that he stayed outside and left early while others were there with their partners must have felt isolating and maybe even embarrassing.

Your request for a break sounds like it comes from a place of frustration, not just about this one event, but perhaps about a pattern of behavior where you feel your needs for connection and social integration aren't being met. While taking a break isn't inherently wrong, it seems like there might be an opportunity here to have a deeper conversation about your expectations in the relationship and understanding his perspective on social situations.

Have you had the chance to discuss with him why he feels uncomfortable in these social settings? Sometimes what looks like disinterest could be social anxiety or discomfort that hasn't been fully expressed.","

","It sounds like you're feeling hurt and frustrated by your boyfriend's actions, especially since you felt like he wasn't making an effort to connect with your friends or be present at the graduation ceremony. You expressed your feelings to him, but instead of understanding or apologizing, he didn't seem to see anything wrong with his behavior. That must have been really disappointing for you.

It's understandable that you asked for a break, given how you're feeling. However, it's also possible that you're not just asking for a break from the situation, but also from the feelings of frustration and hurt that have been building up. It might be helpful to take some time to reflect on what you need from your partner in terms of social interactions and communication, and to consider whether this is a deal-breaker for you or something that can be worked through.","

You’re honest about the impact—he left when you were hoping for shared moments—and you’re also honest about your reaction, calling for a break because the situation left you feeling unvalued.

Your response:
","I hear how deeply hurt and betrayed you're feeling after discovering these repeated deceptions. No, you're not the asshole for seeking legal counsel privately. Your husband has shown a clear pattern of dishonesty - from manipulating the threesome situation, to hiding communications, to changing passwords, to meeting women behind your back. You've given multiple chances for change, set clear boundaries, and he's repeatedly violated your trust.

The fact that you're questioning whether protecting yourself legally makes you an asshole suggests you may still be carrying undeserved guilt about this situation. Your husband's actions weren't just about the threesome - they reveal ongoing deception and disregard for your feelings and relationship agreements.

Taking steps to protect yourself and your interests, including consulting a lawyer privately, is a reasonable response to repeated betrayals of trust. You don't owe someone advance notice that you're finally enforcing consequences for their actions, especially when they've shown they'll use information to manipulate situations to their advantage.

Focus on taking care of yourself and your needs right now. Consider working with a counselor to help process these difficult changes.","

Skip ahead a couple months and I found out that he was talking to another girl at his work and met up with her at a work party and helped her move. Mind up he told he helped a guy at work move and that the party was boring. Again I gave him another chance. then I just found out that he is still talking to the threesome girl on snapchat and had her under a different name and also a few other girls that I didnt know about. I have given him way to many chances.  I cant believe he would throw 20 +yrs away for some young dumb girls. So I am secretly talking with a lawyer and getting ready to serve him with papers that he has no idea is coming. Now he can get shocked by something I do, AITA.

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling utterly betrayed and disrespected by your husband's actions. You had trusted him for over 20 years, and yet, this recent turn of events has left you questioning the entire foundation of your relationship. It's understandable that you feel like he's thrown away everything you've built together for these fleeting connections with younger women.

I sense a deep pain and hurt in your words, and I can see why you'd want to take drastic action. You feel like you've given him multiple chances, and yet he continues to prioritize these other relationships over yours. It's not about the threesome itself, but about the dishonesty and lack of respect that followed.

While I won't judge whether you're right or wrong, I do want to acknowledge the complexity of your emotions and the pain you're feeling. It takes a lot of courage to admit that your relationship has reached a breaking point, and it's clear that you're trying to take care of yourself in the midst of all this chaos.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: AITA for secretly going to a lawyer for a divorce for a threesome gone wrong?  I 38F husband 44M have been together for 20+ yrs. We have never had any problems with infidelity in our relationship until this year. If you would have asked me I would have swore to the moon nd back that he would never go behind my back and talk to other women. This year we decided to spice up our relationship and have a threesome, he automatically knew exactly who he wanted to join (which should of been my first red flag). It was a coworker of his who ""randomly"" texted him and they became ""friends"". He spoke with the girl and told me she was completely down with trying a threesome as well. Skip to the day of the threesome we decided to get a hotel and he told me he would meet me there so I did, when I got there she was already in the room and he told me he didn't fully tell her that I was going to be involved. Which instantly upset me, he said he told her I wanted to watch. During this I didn't just watch but joined in but he seemed to give her all of the attention which made me feel very insecure and upset because it seemed like I was the one invited instead of the other way around. After there was an argument because some of the rules we set he broke. I told him I didnt want to talk to her anymore and he told me that he did and found out that he continued talking to her. When he was caught he told me that it was because he wanted another one and didn't want to just stop talking to her. So then again  asked to look at his phone and seen that the text they had started way before i knew and went into eat more detail then I knew, I also seen that there were many pictures sent from her to him. I told him to delete her again this time i just had a gut feeling so i went to look at his phone (we have eachothers passwords) and his password was changed, he made an excuse saying he did that so the kids couldn't get into his phone. Finally i threatened to leave if he didnt deleted her for good.

Your response:
","I hear how betrayed and hurt you feel—20 + years of marriage and a sudden, repeated breach of trust can shake anyone to the core. It’s understandable that you’re looking for a way to protect yourself and to hold him accountable. Before you hand over papers, consider whether a direct, honest conversation might still give you clarity or at least a chance to set firm boundaries.

A legal route can feel like the only escape, but it also cuts off the possibility of repairing the relationship (if that’s still a goal). You might explore couples counseling or a mediator to talk through what “trust” means to each of you. That said, you deserve to feel safe and respected. If the pattern continues, protection is legitimate—but try to weigh whether silence or confrontation will ultimately serve you better.","

zcjnnv,AITAH,AITA for not sharing my husband’s remains,Conscious-Amount4435,"My (31F) husband (36M), learned he had stage 4 cancer and began treatments in January. Through the entire process, I was by his side at every appointment and at home. I was always there and caring for him through this devastating and terrifying ordeal. His biological family? Not so much. They didn’t really check in or anything. His mom called every once in awhile to harass him in some way. For example, she would go on a diatribe about how he needed to pray more for God to heal him. That he needed to quit his job. That he needed to get rid of our birds (she believed that the birds caused his stomach cancer). This list can go on and on for days. 
When he was in the hospital for neutropenia, she again harassed him about getting rid of the birds and he refused. One of them was his ESA. He adores her so much. He made a full recovery within 5 days and was back at home and cried when he saw his bird. He was so happy to be reunited with her. 
A month later, he was admitted again but this time because he was literally bleeding internally. His mother spread a rumor that he was hospitalized for histoplasmosis. She even had his sister make a hateful post towards me saying I was killing him with my refusal to get rid of the birds even though they didn’t cause his cancer, weren’t making him worse and they actually brought him joy. At that moment, everything changed. He became very irritated which was so rare and an order was put in place by the doctor that any visitor had to go be cleared by the nurse station. They said my husband told them that he only wanted to see his wife (me).  His mom called the hospital every 15 minutes, trying to get info but was denied that due to HIPPA. She was fuming. She then called my husband screaming at him, insisting that he had histoplasmosis, that he needed to get rid of the birds, that she had a right to know what was wrong with her (adult) child, that he needed to quit his job and that his siblings were “afraid” that their brother will die due to this. (Why wasn’t the fact it was stage 4 concerning to them?)
The last 3 days of his life, he was in the hospital as he went into sudden liver and kidney failure. The second day, I was in meetings with hospice, transport and doctors. This gave his family alone time with him which I was sure they appreciated. However, it came to my attention that while I was signing the papers to place him in hospice and transport him home, his mother attempted to undermine me and have him taken into in-patient where he already expressed he didn’t want to be. He already expressed his desire to be at home. I honestly thought that this was all about having more access to him but I later learned it was because she believed that he would live longer there (and suffer longer). Spoiler alert: the level of care is no different whether you are in the in-patient hospice or home hospice. 
She even tried to get a doctor to agree with her on him being transported to in-patient and insisted that his wife shouldn’t get to decide because “they haven’t been married long enough” in her eyes. When I left for home to ready the house for his arrival, his brother stole my husband’s clothing and shoes. I had the good sense to take his wallet with me but the cash that he always kept in his wallet was gone. 
My husband arrived home at 9pm that night and passed away 6 hours after his arrival. 
The funeral planning began instead of being buried in a plot purchased by his mother, he wanted to be cremated with the condition that part of him would be made into an artful ash sculpture. I was totally content in providing his family with a portion of his remains until I was on the receiving end of their relentless hatred. 
The day before his funeral, his mom took to facebook to make a bold claim that I was going to his place of employment, begging for money. He had a high security position that requires a badge to get in the doors. So even if I wanted to do that (which I wouldn’t ever) I couldn’t. 
I was also accused of killing him. 
His mom also said that I would’ve rather had the life insurance policy than my husband which is another huge lie. I’d give up everything I own to have him. I’d live homeless, under a bridge to have him. 
His brother stole a gift that my husband got for my dad and brother. It was at his place of employment. 
And the deciding factor of this decision was the fact that I learned that my late husband’s brother sought a lawyer to try to strip me of his possessions and his insurance policy.  The state law gives everything to the surviving spouse unless otherwise stipulated in a will. We had all the documents ready because of his condition. Everything was left to me just as everything was left to him in mine. 
They cared more about his stuff and his money than him because if they didn’t, they would’ve checked in on him. They would’ve showed up to support him. They would’ve been there for him in that last year of his life but instead, they threw a fit because they received nothing. 
They asked for 6 artful ash sculptures (they’re $185 per sculpture) and wanted me to foot that bill and I refused. After everything they’ve put he and I through, and trust me, there’s plenty that isn’t in here, I don’t feel they should have any bit of him. But I wonder… am I the asshole?",249,143,1670183600,Absolutely not. Forget about those people immediately.,167,AnaTheMuse,NTA. I am sorry for your loss. How have your DH’s birds handled his loss?,3,Avebury1,"I'm truly sorry for the loss you've experienced and the difficult situation you find yourself in. From what you've shared, it seems like you were a devoted partner, providing unwavering support to your husband during his illness. Your feelings of betrayal and hurt are understandable, given the actions of his family and their treatment of both you and him during such a vulnerable time.

The decision about your husband's remains is deeply personal and should reflect his wishes and your relationship with him. It seems like you are trying to honor his desires amidst a challenging environment. It's not uncommon for grief to bring out difficult emotions and conflicts within families, especially when there's a history of tension.

It's important to prioritize what feels right for you and what you believe your husband would have wanted. Seeking support from friends, a counselor, or a support group might help you navigate these emotions and decisions. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries to protect your own well-being during this time.","

Your response:
","Based on the situation described, you are not the asshole for keeping your husband's remains. Here's why:

1. You were his primary caregiver and devoted spouse through his illness, while his family was largely absent and unsupportive
2. His family actively caused him distress during his final months with harassment, false accusations, and attempts to override his medical wishes
3. They demonstrated extremely problematic behavior including:
- Theft of his belongings
- Attempting to contest his will
- Making false public accusations against you
- Trying to interfere with his end-of-life care decisions
- Spreading harmful rumors about his condition

Your husband chose you as his medical decision-maker and left his affairs to you in his will. Given their hostile actions and disrespect for both his wishes and you as his chosen partner, protecting his remains from further drama seems reasonable and aligned with protecting his dignity.

While sharing remains can be a kind gesture in normal circumstances, their behavior has demonstrated they may not handle this responsibility respectfully. Focus on honoring your husband's memory in the way he wanted.","

Your response:
","You don't sound like the asshole to me. What I hear is a wife who was deeply devoted to her husband, cared for him tirelessly through his illness, and is now trying to protect herself from the same people who emotionally tormented him in his final days. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to give them a portion of his remains after everything they've done, especially considering their motives seem more focused on his possessions and insurance policy than genuinely grieving his loss.

It's heartbreaking that you had to deal with his family's toxic behavior while trying to navigate the immense pain of losing your partner. Your decision to keep his remains to yourself might not be the most conventional, but given the circumstances, it's a response that makes sense to me. You deserve to prioritize your own healing and well-being during this difficult time.","

They said my husband told them that he only wanted to see his wife (me).  His mom called the hospital every 15 minutes, trying to get info but was denied that due to HIPPA. She was fuming. She then called my husband screaming at him, insisting that he had histoplasmosis, that he needed to get rid of the birds, that she had a right to know what was wrong with her (adult) child, that he needed to quit his job and that his siblings were “afraid” that their brother will die due to this. (Why wasn’t the fact it was stage 4 concerning to them?)
The last 3 days of his life, he was in the hospital as he went into sudden liver and kidney failure. The second day, I was in meetings with hospice, transport and doctors. This gave his family alone time with him which I was sure they appreciated. However, it came to my attention that while I was signing the papers to place him in hospice and transport him home, his mother attempted to undermine me and have him taken into in-patient where he already expressed he didn’t want to be. He already expressed his desire to be at home. I honestly thought that this was all about having more access to him but I later learned it was because she believed that he would live longer there (and suffer longer). Spoiler alert: the level of care is no different whether you are in the in-patient hospice or home hospice. 
She even tried to get a doctor to agree with her on him being transported to in-patient and insisted that his wife shouldn’t get to decide because “they haven’t been married long enough” in her eyes. When I left for home to ready the house for his arrival, his brother stole my husband’s clothing and shoes. I had the good sense to take his wallet with me but the cash that he always kept in his wallet was gone. 
My husband arrived home at 9pm that night and passed away 6 hours after his arrival. 
The funeral planning began instead of being buried in a plot purchased by his mother, he wanted to be cremated with the condition that part of him would be made into an artful ash sculpture. I was totally content in providing his family with a portion of his remains until I was on the receiving end of their relentless hatred. 
The day before his funeral, his mom took to facebook to make a bold claim that I was going to his place of employment, begging for money. He had a high security position that requires a badge to get in the doors. So even if I wanted to do that (which I wouldn’t ever) I couldn’t. 
I was also accused of killing him. 
His mom also said that I would’ve rather had the life insurance policy than my husband which is another huge lie. I’d give up everything I own to have him. I’d live homeless, under a bridge to have him. 
His brother stole a gift that my husband got for my dad and brother. It was at his place of employment. 
And the deciding factor of this decision was the fact that I learned that my late husband’s brother sought a lawyer to try to strip me of his possessions and his insurance policy.  The state law gives everything to the surviving spouse unless otherwise stipulated in a will. We had all the documents ready because of his condition. Everything was left to me just as everything was left to him in mine. 
They cared more about his stuff and his money than him because if they didn’t, they would’ve checked in on him. They would’ve showed up to support him. They would’ve been there for him in that last year of his life but instead, they threw a fit because they received nothing. 
They asked for 6 artful ash sculptures (they’re $185 per sculpture) and wanted me to foot that bill and I refused. After everything they’ve put he and I through, and trust me, there’s plenty that isn’t in here, I don’t feel they should have any bit of him. But I wonder… am I the asshole?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve been through an unimaginable, exhausting fight for your husband’s dignity and your own sanity. You carried him, stood up to a family that felt entitled to control every detail, and made every decision you believed honored his wishes. The fact that you didn’t give the rest of his remains to his family, or pay for their costly sculptures, isn’t a “sin” at all—it’s a boundary you set to protect yourself from a toxic dynamic that already did so much harm.  

In short, you’re not an asshole. You’re a grieving spouse who struggled against a family that seemed more interested in possession than compassion. Your actions were a reasonable, if painful, way to preserve your own dignity and keep the memory of","

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for not sharing my husband’s remains  My (31F) husband (36M), learned he had stage 4 cancer and began treatments in January. Through the entire process, I was by his side at every appointment and at home. I was always there and caring for him through this devastating and terrifying ordeal. His biological family? Not so much. They didn’t really check in or anything. His mom called every once in awhile to harass him in some way. For example, she would go on a diatribe about how he needed to pray more for God to heal him. That he needed to quit his job. That he needed to get rid of our birds (she believed that the birds caused his stomach cancer). This list can go on and on for days. 
When he was in the hospital for neutropenia, she again harassed him about getting rid of the birds and he refused. One of them was his ESA. He adores her so much. He made a full recovery within 5 days and was back at home and cried when he saw his bird. He was so happy to be reunited with her. 
A month later, he was admitted again but this time because he was literally bleeding internally. His mother spread a rumor that he was hospitalized for histoplasmosis. She even had his sister make a hateful post towards me saying I was killing him with my refusal to get rid of the birds even though they didn’t cause his cancer, weren’t making him worse and they actually brought him joy. At that moment, everything changed. He became very irritated which was so rare and an order was put in place by the doctor that any visitor had to go be cleared by the nurse station.

xrpjwp,AITAH,AITAH for wearing white to my cousin’s wedding?,Jazzlike_Ad714,"I know it sounds bad, but I’m gonna explain why. So for background, I (21F) got married six months ago. I reluctantly was forced (by my mother) to invite my cousin (26F). Let’s call her Jessica. I had no wish for her to be there, as we never got along. And she was always trying to piss me off. She loved the attention she got from it. Anyways, she showed up to my wedding in a trumpet style prom looking dress that was completely white. It could’ve fooled anyone to think she was the bride. I decided not to cause a scene, as I didn’t want that to ruin my night, even though I was highly offended. The next day she asked why I barely spoke to her, claiming that it was rude of me to not greet all of my guests. Which I did, but I made a point to ignore her, something I knew would piss her off. (She wouldn’t be getting the attention she wanted!!) I explained that I found it extremely rude of her to wear a dress like that to my wedding. Not to mention that it was white. She said that because I never specified that no one could wear white, it wasn’t her fault. But here’s what really got me. She told me it also wasn’t her fault she looked better that day. “We all have those moments” is what she said. I was furious, but I wanted to enjoy my new marriage, so I let it go. Well, about two months ago, I received a wedding invitation in the mail. From her. And in big bold letters it very clearly specified not to wear white. I found it amusing until I found out my mother’s invitation didn’t say anything about not wearing white. As much as I wanted to be impressed by her going out of her way to ensure I couldn’t pay her back, I couldn’t help but let my pettiness get the best of me. I bought a simple cocktail dress in white, and I wore it with pride. Unlike me, she yelled at me i’m front of everyone, asking why I would even think to be that disrespectful on her special day. I simply said that she knew why, and left soon after. Of course, her family and my grandma attacked me, saying I had no room to ruin her night like that. My family is on my side though, and my husband is too, so I don’t really care. My grandma is the only one that hurts because she knew what Jessica pulled at MY wedding.

As far as it not saying don't wear white on your wedding day invitation, that is a crock of shit.  She knows, just like everyone else that you don't wear white to a wedding.  You know the old saying, play with bull, and you'll get the horns.   She played with the bull at your wedding, and you gave her the horns at hers.  Bravo, and I bow down to you queen 🤣",147,justsomehvacguy,"ESH.  Okay, the cousin sucks more because she started it, but why engage with someone like that?  The OP wins this round vis-a-vis the attention-seeking cousin, but loses in the eyes of most wedding guests (and especially anyone who doesn't know the backstory).  


Didn't you feel better about things (and yourself) when you stayed above the fray at your own wedding?    


And why get married at 21 (or maybe 20)?  If you're right for each other, you'll be right for each other in a few more years.  People change a lot in their early 20s, sometimes in different ways.  Entangling your finances, families, and DNA (if you have kids quickly) are all really hard to reverse should things not work.",2,DavidHikinginAlaska,"It sounds like there's a lot of history and unresolved tension between you and Jessica, which has led to this situation. It seems you felt hurt and disrespected by her actions at your wedding, and her invitation might have felt like a deliberate provocation. Your decision to wear white to her wedding was a response to those feelings, and it's understandable to want to address past grievances. However, weddings are emotional and significant events, and wearing white might have escalated the tension rather than resolving it. You mentioned that your actions were driven by pettiness, which suggests some awareness of the potential impact on her special day. It might be helpful to reflect on whether this approach allowed you to express your feelings constructively or if there could be a more effective way to address the underlying issues between you two. Consider whether reaching out for a conversation or finding a way to move forward might ultimately bring more peace to both sides.","

Your response:
","While I understand the hurt and anger from your cousin wearing white to your wedding and her insensitive comments afterward, deliberately wearing white to her wedding as revenge wasn't the best choice. It perpetuated a cycle of negativity and drama that could have been ended by taking the high road.

Your cousin's behavior at your wedding was clearly inappropriate and disrespectful. However, retaliating in kind, especially knowing how hurtful it felt when it happened to you, suggests this was more about getting even than doing what's right. Your grandmother's disappointment is understandable - she likely hoped for better from both of you.

Sometimes the hardest but most mature response is to break the cycle of pettiness, even when we feel justified in our actions. While your feelings are valid, this situation could have been an opportunity to demonstrate grace and rise above the drama, rather than escalating it.

You're not a terrible person for what you did, but yes, this particular choice was an AH move, even if understandably motivated.","

","You seem to feel that your actions were justified, given the circumstances of your cousin's behavior at your wedding. It sounds like you felt disrespected and disregarded by her decision to wear a white dress, and her subsequent comments only added to your frustration. In a way, wearing white to her wedding could be seen as a way of standing up for yourself and asserting that you won't be disrespected without consequences.

However, it's also clear that your actions were driven by a desire to 'get back' at your cousin, which is understandable but perhaps not the most constructive approach. It's worth considering whether this action truly brought you closure or if it simply perpetuated a cycle of conflict. It might be helpful to reflect on whether there was another way you could have addressed the situation without resorting to what could be seen as a petty act of revenge.","

yvwt7s,AITAH,AITA for being heart broken that my best friend of 20 years does not want to be my bridesmaid?,missmouse03,"I (F32) have been best friends with Jenna (F32) since we were twelve and starting high school. We even lived together during our university days. I don’t know how to convey how close we were in such a short posting. But lately Jenna has been setting up very strong boundaries between us. I recently moved to the city she also lives in and expected a warm welcome. I have not heard from her at all. 

In September, completely by coincidence, we both got engaged to our long term partners. 

Yesterday I sent a very expensive box of treats and snacks and a bottle of wine with a note asking her to be my bridesmaid. Today I received a message from her saying she wants to concentrate on her own wedding and does not want to be involved in mine. I am heartbroken. I feel like I’ve lost a friend forever. I’m just not sure I can forgive her.

If you feel that strongly for it though and still have no idea why, then communicate or ask if everything’s alright with her, and you guys. 

Don’t necessarily make the talk about being a bridesmaid though, just on you two. And if she says you guys are good and there’s genuinely “nothing” wrong, then that’s all you can really get and you have to accept it gracefully; while still wishing her well and letting her know you’re always going to be there for her if she needs to talk, or just to hang out every once in a while. Even if that doesn’t change her stance on the bridemaid offer, she’ll know you really are still a good friend, and maybe some new information might come out in on the drift between you two or how exactly she might’ve been so busy with her own life.",87,Latter-Signature-456,"NTA, maybe.

Are your weddings close together? What did you expected of her as a bridesmaid, and did you tell her those expectations? For example, were you planning on having bridesmaids attend dress fittings, bridal brunches, &gt;3 day bachelorette party, bridal shower, expensive rehearsal dinner, etc?

All of those expectations are fine, but you also need to understand a lot of people NOT planning their own wedding don't have the budget or time for all the activities that some brides expect and that warrants a kind decline. However, if that is her reason for declining, she was wrong to assume your expectations. Many brides only expect minimal involvement from bridesmaids.

Based on the context you gave; I think you have some underlying friendship issues unrelated to her being a bridesmaid. She put up a boundary for a reason and you should respectfully speak to her about it.

You are not wrong for being sad/extremely hurt that someone you love does not want to/can't put forward the effort for you.

IMO, weddings are not nearly as stressful as people make them to be. Neither is being a bridesmaid for someone you love. I don't get why it turns into this whole ordeal lol",14,Small_Ostrich6445,"It’s understandable that you're feeling heartbroken and confused. It sounds like Jenna has been a significant part of your life for many years, and her recent behavior is difficult to process. It’s important to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself space to grieve the change in your friendship. However, it might also be helpful to consider Jenna’s perspective. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, and she may feel that she needs to focus on her own life at the moment. It doesn’t necessarily mean she doesn’t value your friendship.

Before responding, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation with Jenna. Express how you feel and ask if there’s more behind her decision. This could provide clarity and help both of you understand each other’s perspectives. Remember, friendships can evolve, and sometimes giving each other space can lead to a renewed connection down the line. You’re not an asshole for feeling heartbroken, but approaching the situation with empathy and understanding may lead to a more positive outcome.","

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for being heart broken that my best friend of 20 years does not want to be my bridesmaid?  I (F32) have been best friends with Jenna (F32) since we were twelve and starting high school. We even lived together during our university days. I don’t know how to convey how close we were in such a short posting. But lately Jenna has been setting up very strong boundaries between us. I recently moved to the city she also lives in and expected a warm welcome. I have not heard from her at all. 

In September, completely by coincidence, we both got engaged to our long term partners. 

Yesterday I sent a very expensive box of treats and snacks and a bottle of wine with a note asking her to be my bridesmaid. Today I received a message from her saying she wants to concentrate on her own wedding and does not want to be involved in mine. I am heartbroken. I feel like I’ve lost a friend forever. I’m just not sure I can forgive her. 

Before I respond I wanted to check if I am the Asshole?.

Your response:
","I hear how deeply hurt you are by this situation, and it's completely understandable to feel heartbroken. A 20-year friendship carries so much history and meaning, and Jenna's response must feel like a shocking rejection, especially given your shared history and coincidental engagements.

However, I don't think this is a situation where anyone is necessarily an ""asshole."" It sounds like Jenna has been gradually creating distance even before this moment, with the strong boundaries and lack of welcome when you moved to her city. Her response about her own wedding might be the clearest signal yet that she's chosen to move in a different direction with her life.

While you're not wrong to feel hurt, taking time to process these emotions before responding would be wise. Consider that there might be more to her perspective that you're not aware of. Instead of focusing on forgiveness right now, perhaps focus on understanding - both your feelings and potentially hers.

Have you considered having an honest, open conversation with her about the changes in your friendship, separate from the wedding discussion?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're really hurt by Jenna's response, and it's understandable given the long history of your friendship. It's not about being the 'asshole,' but more about how you're processing your feelings and expectations. You had a certain idea of how your friend would react, especially after moving to the same city and both getting engaged at the same time. 

It's possible that Jenna's boundaries and decision to focus on her own wedding might not be about you or your friendship, but rather about her own priorities and stressors. It might be helpful to consider having an open and honest conversation with Jenna about how you're feeling, rather than assuming you've lost her as a friend forever. This could help you both understand each other's perspectives and work through your emotions.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re hurting and feeling abandoned, and that’s entirely understandable. Your long‑standing bond makes Jenna’s decision feel like a betrayal, but the fact that she’s choosing to focus on her own wedding doesn’t automatically make you the asshole. People often set boundaries when they’re overwhelmed—engagements, moving, jobs, new relationships can all shift priorities. Jenna may be dealing with her own anxiety about the wedding and feels she can’t give you the time and energy you need right now.  

Try reaching out for a calm chat: ask how she’s feeling, what’s on her mind, and express how much her friendship means to you. If she still says no, remember that a single decision doesn’t erase a 20‑year friendship—though it can be painful. Be kind to yourself as you","

zz63c8,AITAH,AITA for disobeying my girlfriends orders?,Garbageboy5011,"EDIT: sorry to anyone that thinks the title is rude, I didn’t mean for it to come across that way and I completely understand. If I was given the option to change it I would, because that’s not what I meant at all.

YES, IM THE ASSHOLE. I’ve realised it, and I’m tired so I’m kind of done with this. Have fun calling me the asshole if you want to, but like… I already know so what’s the point

I’m staying at my girlfriends apartment for new years and I’ve brought my dogs (both Malamutes, and rather large for their breed) with me. She’s fine with this, but she’s very strict about not letting the dogs on the couch. I get it, they’re big dogs, and they moult a lot even in the winter, so there’s a chance they could get hair all over her couch or even break it, so I’ve obeyed the rule as much as I can and have even sat on the floor for long periods of time so that my dogs, if they needed me, wouldn’t try to get up on her couch.. However, they’re both really old for their breed, and both suffer from some joint issues.

Because of this, my eldest dog has issues with standing up and she can often cause a bit of a mess when trying to do so as it puts too much pressure on her bladder. It’s gotten bad the past couple of days, and so my girlfriend took her to the vet whilst I had to stay at the apartment with the younger dog, as he’s much larger and can act up when my other dog is not there, so he needed someone to stay with him and be able to comfort him in her absence.

However, he’s a very old dog, and can get very nervous, so whilst I was sat on the couch, he climbed up next to me (with much struggle, and I tried to discourage it) and laid down. I tried to get him off, but it’s hard enough for him to get up on the couch with his joints, and getting down is only harder for him and he’s too heavy to pick up without injuring him or myself, so I let him lay on the couch with me for a while until my other dog returned. He seemed to really calm down whilst he was laid with me, so I thought that it would have been worth it regardless.

The couch is fine, and I had a blanket down on the couch so no hair got on the couch itself, and the blanket would just need a little lint rolling, but my girlfriend is telling me I shouldn’t have done it. I understand that it is her apartment, and that I’m only a visitor, that breaking the rules of her apartment was disrespectful and stuff, but I’m not going to apologise for anything beyond hurting her feelings because… my dog needed comfort, and he’s old as shit, I wasn’t going to risk hurting him or myself just because he wanted to cuddle.

Unless you paid for the place and couches you follow her rules,164,littlemissmoxie,"YTA-  this is coming from a dog person.  I’ve had dogs all my life, but people come first IMO.  If you agreed to those terms living with your gf then then you should follow them.  I think the whole section of the dog was too big to move or dissuade is BS you have to control your animal lay on the floor with it.  For context my dog sleeps on my bed with me but only because my wife and I agreed that it is OK and it isn’t always the case some times he has to stay on the floor",60,ForesterySC,"It sounds like you’re in a tough spot, trying to balance respecting your girlfriend’s rules with the needs of your elderly dogs. It’s clear you care deeply for your dogs, especially given their age and health issues. Letting your dog on the couch seems like it was a compassionate choice in the moment, even if it went against your girlfriend’s wishes. It’s important to acknowledge her feelings too, as it’s her space and her boundaries.

Perhaps a conversation focused on understanding each other’s perspectives could help. Explain why you felt it was necessary for your dog’s comfort and see if there’s a way to accommodate both your girlfriend’s rules and your dogs’ needs in the future. For instance, maybe there’s a way to create a comfortable space for your dogs that doesn’t involve the couch. Communication and empathy on both sides might help resolve the tension and ensure everyone feels respected.","

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy while addressing the core issue:

I can see you're really caught between wanting to respect your girlfriend's rules and caring for your elderly dog's needs. Your concern for your dog's physical and emotional comfort comes from a place of love and responsibility. However, the way you're framing this as ""disobeying orders"" versus doing what you felt was right suggests there might be some underlying communication issues with your girlfriend.

Instead of viewing this as a right/wrong situation, perhaps you could have a calm discussion with your girlfriend about finding compromise solutions - like designated dog-friendly areas with protective covers, or alternative comfortable spots for the dogs that work for everyone. The fact that you took precautions with the blanket shows you were trying to be considerate.

This isn't really about being an ""asshole"" - it's about finding ways to balance respect for your girlfriend's home with the legitimate needs of your aging pets. Consider having an honest conversation about both of your concerns and work together to find solutions that make everyone comfortable.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between two good intentions: respecting your girlfriend’s house rules and caring for an elderly dog who truly needs comfort. Your girlfriend set a rule because she cares about the couch and her own comfort, and that rule was clear and reasonable. When your dog’s physical limitations made the rule difficult to follow, you made a judgment call that prioritized his well‑being over the rule. That’s a compassionate choice, but it also breached a boundary that was important to her.

A constructive path might be to apologize for the rule breach, explain the dog’s situation, and suggest ways to prevent future conflicts—perhaps a designated “dog zone” or a temporary mat on the couch. By acknowledging her feelings and proposing a compromise, you’ll show respect for her space while still caring for your pet. You’re not an asshole; you’re navigating a gray area that could use a little communication.","

It’s gotten bad the past couple of days, and so my girlfriend took her to the vet whilst I had to stay at the apartment with the younger dog, as he’s much larger and can act up when my other dog is not there, so he needed someone to stay with him and be able to comfort him in her absence.

However, he’s a very old dog, and can get very nervous, so whilst I was sat on the couch, he climbed up next to me (with much struggle, and I tried to discourage it) and laid down. I tried to get him off, but it’s hard enough for him to get up on the couch with his joints, and getting down is only harder for him and he’s too heavy to pick up without injuring him or myself, so I let him lay on the couch with me for a while until my other dog returned. He seemed to really calm down whilst he was laid with me, so I thought that it would have been worth it regardless.

The couch is fine, and I had a blanket down on the couch so no hair got on the couch itself, and the blanket would just need a little lint rolling, but my girlfriend is telling me I shouldn’t have done it. I understand that it is her apartment, and that I’m only a visitor, that breaking the rules of her apartment was disrespectful and stuff, but I’m not going to apologise for anything beyond hurting her feelings because… my dog needed comfort, and he’s old as shit, I wasn’t going to risk hurting him or myself just because he wanted to cuddle.

So am I the asshole?.

If he doesn't like it, he can find his own. You make what the kids love and fits in your budget and that's all you have to do.

Was he injured at work?,2,Short_Road1993,"It sounds like you're in a really challenging situation, trying to balance the needs and tastes of your family while also managing a tighter budget. It's understandable that repeated complaints about meals you put effort into can feel disheartening, especially when you're trying to make the most of what you have. Your feelings of frustration are completely valid.

It seems like your husband’s criticism is adding stress to an already difficult situation, and it’s understandable to feel like you need to set boundaries. Maybe a conversation with him could help, where you express how his comments make you feel and the challenges you face when planning meals. You could also suggest a night or two where he takes charge of dinner, which might help him appreciate the effort involved and foster more understanding.

Ultimately, taking care of yourself and ensuring you don’t feel taken for granted is important. You’re doing your best, and it’s okay to ask for support or make changes that help reduce stress for you.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and hurt you are by your husband's constant criticism of your cooking, especially when you're doing your best to feed the family on a tighter budget. It sounds like you're putting a lot of thought and care into making meals that the kids enjoy while trying to stretch the dollars, and his complaints feel like a rejection of those efforts.

I sense there might be more going on here - perhaps your husband is struggling with the changes in your financial situation and taking out his feelings through these complaints about food. This doesn't excuse his behavior, but it might help explain it.

Instead of completely stopping cooking for him, which could escalate tensions, maybe you could have an honest conversation with him about how his comments make you feel and work together to find meals that fit both your budget and his preferences. If he continues being unreasonable despite attempts to communicate, then setting boundaries around meal preparation might be necessary.

Remember, wanting appreciation for your efforts doesn't make you the problem here.","

","It sounds like you're feeling undervalued and frustrated by your husband's constant complaints about the meals you prepare. You're not just cooking for him, but for your entire family, and it seems like everyone else is appreciative of your efforts except for him. Given your current financial struggles, it's even more understandable that you're feeling stretched thin and resentful of his lack of gratitude.

I sense that you're not just tired of cooking, but also tired of being criticized and unappreciated. You're considering a boundary by not cooking for him anymore, which might be a way for you to reclaim some sense of control and self-worth in this situation. Before making any decisions, I'd like to ask: have you considered having an open and honest conversation with your husband about how his comments are affecting you?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re juggling a lot—new financial limits, a recovering husband, and the pressure of feeding a family—while also dealing with constant criticism. That’s exhausting. A lot of the frustration likely comes from a place of feeling insecure about the change in your household income and the stress of the accident, not from a genuine dislike of your cooking.

Instead of withdrawing entirely, try a small compromise: set aside one “family‑meal” day each week where you cook together or let him choose a simple budget‑friendly dish (like a stir‑fry, a simple soup, or a sheet‑pan meal). Invite him to the grocery list and ask for a few affordable ideas he’d enjoy. This gives him ownership and reduces his sense of helplessness. If he still complains, gently explain how the budget limits options and that you’re doing your best. If the conflict continues, consider a short family","

Being screamed at and having someone invade your personal space can be extremely distressing and might trigger a defensive reaction. It’s understandable that you felt the need to protect yourself, especially if you felt threatened or disrespected. However, resorting to physical actions, like headbutting, can escalate conflicts and potentially cause harm, both physically and emotionally. While your feelings of frustration and anger are valid, it might be helpful to reflect on other ways to handle such situations in the future, perhaps through setting boundaries or seeking a safe space away from the confrontation. It’s important for both of you to communicate in a way that is respectful and non-threatening. Consider discussing these issues, possibly with the help of a counselor or mediator, to ensure both your safety and emotional well-being.","

Your response:
","While I understand you felt threatened and disrespected, responding with physical violence isn't the answer, regardless of gender. Your husband's sexist comments and aggressive behavior by screaming in your face were completely inappropriate, but headbutting him escalated the situation to physical assault, which is never okay and could have legal consequences.

It seems like there are deeper issues here beyond this single incident, given you mentioned he's your ""soon to be x husband."" When someone gets that physically close and aggressive during an argument, the safest response is to remove yourself from the situation if possible. If you feel physically threatened, contact authorities or seek help from domestic violence resources.

I encourage you to speak with a counselor or therapist who can help you process these emotions and develop safer strategies for handling conflict, especially during what sounds like a difficult divorce process. Your safety and wellbeing should be the priority.","

","You sound incredibly angry and hurt by your husband's comments, and feeling disrespected by his behavior.

I can understand why you might see headbutting him as a way to stand up for yourself and prove a point. However, I also sense that there's a deeper issue at play here - the fact that you're in a relationship with someone who holds such sexist views and is willing to express them in such an aggressive manner. It might be helpful to explore why you're still in this relationship and what you hope to achieve by staying in it. As for whether you're the asshole, I think it's more complex than that. You were clearly provoked, but it's also possible that there were other ways to handle the situation that wouldn't have resulted in physical violence.","

zg3d5w,AITAH,WIBTA if i leave/breakup with my boyfriend?,trashthow_away," 

heads up this may be a long one....

WIBTA to just leave or breakup with my boyfriend?(throw away acct)

i 22 F have been dating 27 M for up to 4 yrs now, he has a child who i am the step mother to. recently, i have had thoughts of leaving my boyfriend, for context, i am just tired of doing everything, i feel like i am a mother 2 kids.

i pay the bills, HIS car insurance i pay for, i even pay for his damn wax for him to smoke... im always doing the cleaning, cooking, letting out the dogs, making sure my boyfriend kid is up and takes a shower and dressed for school. Then i work a 830-5 job i remotely work, but i am always late to due to having to wait for my step-kids mom to pick her up for school (we live about 20 mins away from the school my step-daughter mom wanted her to go to so she picks her up she is usually picking her up by 845 and step-daughter has to be at school by 9am) i also have to let the dogs out and feed them in the morning so i dont even get to work until maybe 9am or later, i have already told work about whats going on and im so very close to losing the job due to my boyfriend just sleeping in and refusing to get his kid ready for school so i can get ready for work. he'll get very mad at me and throw a fit basically if i tell him he needs to get up as he hates getting up in the morning.

Recently i have had the thought of just leaving when my step-daughter is at her moms so she doesnt witness what would end up going down. i love my boyfriend a lot and i love his kid as well, but it is becoming overwhelming and i feel like i have no space to breath, my boyfriend constantly tells me how he wants someone in his life to help relieve his stress and make him happy not put stress on him, so because of that obviously as stated before, i take care of his kid basically while he sleeps in, his daughter gets home around 4-430 pm and so i leave work early (Again my job is not okay with this but his daughter will not leave me alone to work my shift and will constantly ask me to get her stuff even when i am on phone with a customer when i am not suppose to have background noise or other people in the room as i work per my work remote home contract i had signed) to tend to her while my boyfriend stays asleep till maybe 5-530 or later depending how tired he is.

i let out the dogs and feed them because if he does it he complains how he did not want them and wants to get rid of them and how he always has to do it even though hes let them out maybe 5-6 times in our 4 yrs of being together and one of our dogs is a germen shepherd that he WANTED and i had bought for him 3 yrs ago.

i do all the cooking even if my boyfriend is up in the AM, i make his daughters food make myself food then my boyfriend food BUT i dont even eat my food until im done with the dishes and done wiping down the stove and counters. After im done eating and picking up after everyone, i sweep and mop, then i cooking dinner do the same thing i give everyone one else their meals while my plate sits and gets cold as i clean up dinner and clean sweep and mop. why? because if i dont i wont hear the end of it.

i sit here and think about leaving because my boyfriend doesn't do anything refuses to look for a job because he hates doing the application but expects me to do it, as if i enjoy doing the application and apply for him. he refuses to help me a good 97% of the time and when he does help he gets very OCD and tells me how to sweep and mop and then goes off saying how im a terrible cleaner and how he will just do the cleaning then ask if im going to sweep or mop. everyday i wake up stressed out with a headache because im afraid ill be yelled at early AM. im starting to hate living with him and rather live by myself, the funny part is my boyfriend acts all nice and loving towards me and doesn't yell as much when he daughter is not here, but as soon as its his week with his kid, everyday is an argument, i can tell him how much i dont want to argue in front of his kid as i can see how its effecting her, he will ignore it and continue and then tell me how much he hates me and doesn't know why he continues to deal with me and how i never do shit and hes doing everything, i can list to him everything i do and his response will always be ""The women in my opinion should be the one to take care of the kid and do the cooking and cleaning"" he didn't like my response back of ""Then i guess instead of me being the bread winner because you are the man, you should get a job and become the bread winner"" he obviously went off on me for that comment...

As i type this, my mental health has hit rock bottom and continues to spiral down to where? i dont even know at this point, i feel stressed constantly...i want to tell him i want to break up, but i can already tell you guys, this will be his reaction

""There is no breaking up, i am not starting over with someone else, we have been together for 4 years, i thought you loved me and my daughter, you're so selfish always just thinking about your self never thinking about me or my kid, if you leave im just telling my daughters mom she can keep her and her boyfriend can be my kids daddy and ill just drive off somewhere....""

there is more to that as he will try to gas light me then pull me in for a hug to tell me how he loves me and doesnt want to lose me...i stay for the sole reason i have no where to go, due to me paying for everything, i have no money left over to spend on myself or to leave, i have no family to go to and my 1 and only friend, has no room for me until her one tenant moves out and that wont be till end of tax season and if im being honest i dont think im going to last till then....id rather sleep under bridge at this point

even though there is more to this i will stop it here unless asked for my details on anything that is unclear as if i continue id be at my computer for hours typing a story about my life and how crappy is basically is..",108,123,1670515978,"Dude… just leave.

Make the kids dinner and your own funny how he can be up and expect yours to get cold.. when he does go at you about the housework stand your ground and say well there’s the mop, there’s the broom, go for it. And leave it. Make sure you sit down at dinner time and eat your meal with them at the table I feel he is making you the live in cleaner and expects all this stuff done and doesn’t care about you.. as for the way he is treating you when it’s his week I will say this he is probably thinking if he does this and treats you bad the child will go back to her mum and tell.. honestly I would leave just pack up and go but some revenge would be fun.. there will be a point when you finally go YUP I’ve had enough, trust your gut and leave",5,taintedvixen,"It sounds like you're in an incredibly challenging situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. From what you've shared, it seems like your relationship has become one-sided, with you taking on the majority of responsibilities without the support you deserve. It's crucial to recognize that your well-being and mental health are important and that you deserve to be in a partnership where both parties contribute and support each other.

Your boyfriend's reaction to the idea of breaking up, as you've described, seems manipulative and dismissive of your feelings and needs. It's concerning that he uses guilt and emotional manipulation to keep you in the relationship. You have every right to prioritize your own happiness and to seek a living situation that doesn't drain you emotionally and physically.

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: WIBTA if i leave/breakup with my boyfriend?   

heads up this may be a long one....

WIBTA to just leave or breakup with my boyfriend?(throw away acct)

i 22 F have been dating 27 M for up to 4 yrs now, he has a child who i am the step mother to. recently, i have had thoughts of leaving my boyfriend, for context, i am just tired of doing everything, i feel like i am a mother 2 kids.

i pay the bills, HIS car insurance i pay for, i even pay for his damn wax for him to smoke... im always doing the cleaning, cooking, letting out the dogs, making sure my boyfriend kid is up and takes a shower and dressed for school. Then i work a 830-5 job i remotely work, but i am always late to due to having to wait for my step-kids mom to pick her up for school (we live about 20 mins away from the school my step-daughter mom wanted her to go to so she picks her up she is usually picking her up by 845 and step-daughter has to be at school by 9am) i also have to let the dogs out and feed them in the morning so i dont even get to work until maybe 9am or later, i have already told work about whats going on and im so very close to losing the job due to my boyfriend just sleeping in and refusing to get his kid ready for school so i can get ready for work. he'll get very mad at me and throw a fit basically if i tell him he needs to get up as he hates getting up in the morning.

Recently i have had the thought of just leaving when my step-daughter is at her moms so she doesnt witness what would end up going down. i love my boyfriend a lot and i love his kid as well, but it is becoming overwhelming and i feel like i have no space to breath, my boyfriend constantly tells me how he wants someone in his life to help relieve his stress and make him happy not put stress on him, so because of that obviously as stated before, i take care of his kid basically while he sleeps in, his daughter gets home around 4-430 pm and so i leave work early (Again my job is not okay with this but his daughter will not leave me alone to work my shift and will constantly ask me to get her stuff even when i am on phone with a customer when i am not suppose to have background noise or other people in the room as i work per my work remote home contract i had signed) to tend to her while my boyfriend stays asleep till maybe 5-530 or later depending how tired he is.

i let out the dogs and feed them because if he does it he complains how he did not want them and wants to get rid of them and how he always has to do it even though hes let them out maybe 5-6 times in our 4 yrs of being together and one of our dogs is a germen shepherd that he WANTED and i had bought for him 3 yrs ago.

i do all the cooking even if my boyfriend is up in the AM, i make his daughters food make myself food then my boyfriend food BUT i dont even eat my food until im done with the dishes and done wiping down the stove and counters. After im done eating and picking up after everyone, i sweep and mop, then i cooking dinner do the same thing i give everyone one else their meals while my plate sits and gets cold as i clean up dinner and clean sweep and mop. why? because if i dont i wont hear the end of it.

i sit here and think about leaving because my boyfriend doesn't do anything refuses to look for a job because he hates doing the application but expects me to do it, as if i enjoy doing the application and apply for him. he refuses to help me a good 97% of the time and when he does help he gets very OCD and tells me how to sweep and mop and then goes off saying how im a terrible cleaner and how he will just do the cleaning then ask if im going to sweep or mop. everyday i wake up stressed out with a headache because im afraid ill be yelled at early AM. im starting to hate living with him and rather live by myself, the funny part is my boyfriend acts all nice and loving towards me and doesn't yell as much when he daughter is not here, but as soon as its his week with his kid, everyday is an argument, i can tell him how much i dont want to argue in front of his kid as i can see how its effecting her, he will ignore it and continue and then tell me how much he hates me and doesn't know why he continues to deal with me and how i never do shit and hes doing everything, i can list to him everything i do and his response will always be ""The women in my opinion should be the one to take care of the kid and do the cooking and cleaning"" he didn't like my response back of ""Then i guess instead of me being the bread winner because you are the man, you should get a job and become the bread winner"" he obviously went off on me for that comment...

As i type this, my mental health has hit rock bottom and continues to spiral down to where? i dont even know at this point, i feel stressed constantly...i want to tell him i want to break up, but i can already tell you guys, this will be his reaction

""There is no breaking up, i am not starting over with someone else, we have been together for 4 years, i thought you loved me and my daughter, you're so selfish always just thinking about your self never thinking about me or my kid, if you leave im just telling my daughters mom she can keep her and her boyfriend can be my kids daddy and ill just drive off somewhere....""

there is more to that as he will try to gas light me then pull me in for a hug to tell me how he loves me and doesnt want to lose me...i stay for the sole reason i have no where to go, due to me paying for everything, i have no money left over to spend on myself or to leave, i have no family to go to and my 1 and only friend, has no room for me until her one tenant moves out and that wont be till end of tax season and if im being honest i dont think im going to last till then....id rather sleep under bridge at this point

even though there is more to this i will stop it here unless asked for my details on anything that is unclear as if i continue id be at my computer for hours typing a story about my life and how crappy is basically is...

Your response:
","Based on the situation you've described, you would absolutely not be the asshole for leaving this relationship. It's clear you're in an emotionally and financially abusive situation where you're being exploited and manipulated. Your boyfriend is using classic controlling tactics - making you financially responsible for everything while refusing to work, threatening self-harm or abandonment of his child if you leave, and gaslighting you when you try to stand up for yourself.

Your mental health is suffering, your job is at risk, and you're being made responsible for everything while being criticized and belittled. This is not a healthy relationship.

Please know that there are domestic violence resources and organizations that can help you plan a safe exit, even if you don't have family support. They can help you find temporary housing and connect you with resources. You don't have to wait until you have the perfect escape plan - your wellbeing matters and you deserve better than this situation.

Consider reaching out to a domestic violence hotline or local women's shelter for guidance on safely leaving this relationship. They're experienced in helping people in similar situations.","

Your response:
","I can sense the overwhelming exhaustion and desperation in your words. It's clear that you feel trapped in a situation where you're shouldering the bulk of the responsibilities, and your partner is not only not contributing but also emotionally draining you.

It's heartbreaking to hear that you're struggling to make ends meet, working remotely, and taking care of your partner's child, all while feeling unappreciated and unheard. The fact that your partner expects you to take care of everything and then has the audacity to criticize you for not doing it to his standards is unacceptable.

It's also alarming to hear that you're experiencing gaslighting and emotional manipulation. His reaction to your potential breakup is a classic example of this, where he tries to guilt trip you into staying and then pulls you in for a hug, making you feel like you're the one who's crazy.

I want you to know that you deserve so much better than this. You deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and appreciation. It's not selfish to prioritize your own needs and well-being; it's essential.

While it's understandable that you feel stuck due to financial constraints, I want to encourage you to explore options for seeking help. Have you considered reaching out to local support groups or counseling services? They may be able to provide you with emotional support and guidance on how to navigate this situation.

Remember, you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

zzq1dq,AITAH,AITA for keeping my exes rules in place despite my girlfriend not liking them?,Potential-Lemon-5817,"I, 22f, had a kid in highschool with my ex, 23m, and due to personal reasons, my ex isn’t able to be in my sons life as much as he wants to be. One of such reasons is his parents. They weren’t great at raising him, to put it into kind terms, and so it became a general rule that they’d have nothing to do with our kid, and if we ever needed support, that we’d go to my parents to get it. 

I’m currently dating someone else, 22f, and it’s been a long enough lasting relationship that she’s met my son and everything but she always gets weird at the mention of my exes parents. I’d understand it if it were because she doesn’t like me talking about her ex, but that’s not it. She’s friends with him (albeit not very closely) and, from what I can gather, is completely fine whenever he comes up in conversation. It’s the grandparents that get to her.

I asked her about it, and she told me that, honestly, she just doesn’t understand how I’m able to, not only deprive people of their grandchild, but also deprive my child of his grandparents. She said that he needs the extra support from them, no matter how they acted when my ex was growing up, and mostly just things like that. I guess I understand that point, from an outside perspective, but I’m never going to get rid of that rule, it’s not my rule to get rid of. If my ex eventually feels willing to let his parents meet his son, then sure, the rule is gone, but I’m not breaking that trust simply because it makes my girlfriend upset to think that my child is being ‘deprived’",149,73,1672477982,"NTA, this seems like good honest parenting. And that you and your ex both have the child's interest at heart. Well done.  Your new partner has literally no voice in this discussion and their opinion is irrelevant. It's moo.",191,CarpeCyprinidae,Your ex is a piece of s . You should cut him off completly . I dont think your kid is deprived of anything without them .,1,Icy-Layer-4738,"It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, trying to balance the needs and safety of your child with the concerns of your girlfriend. It's clear that protecting your child is your top priority, and maintaining the established boundaries with your ex's parents is part of that. It's understandable that your girlfriend might find this difficult to understand, especially if she values family connections. However, the decision to limit contact with your child's grandparents is based on experiences and considerations that are deeply personal and protective in nature.

It's important to communicate to your girlfriend that this decision isn't about depriving your child of grandparents, but rather about ensuring a safe and supportive environment. Encourage open dialogue where you can both express your feelings and concerns. You might also suggest exploring other ways to provide your child with a strong support network, emphasizing that your actions are guided by love and a desire to provide the best for your child. Ultimately, fostering understanding and empathy in your relationship can help navigate this delicate issue.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for keeping my exes rules in place despite my girlfriend not liking them?  I, 22f, had a kid in highschool with my ex, 23m, and due to personal reasons, my ex isn’t able to be in my sons life as much as he wants to be. One of such reasons is his parents. They weren’t great at raising him, to put it into kind terms, and so it became a general rule that they’d have nothing to do with our kid, and if we ever needed support, that we’d go to my parents to get it. 

I’m currently dating someone else, 22f, and it’s been a long enough lasting relationship that she’s met my son and everything but she always gets weird at the mention of my exes parents. I’d understand it if it were because she doesn’t like me talking about her ex, but that’s not it. She’s friends with him (albeit not very closely) and, from what I can gather, is completely fine whenever he comes up in conversation. It’s the grandparents that get to her.

I asked her about it, and she told me that, honestly, she just doesn’t understand how I’m able to, not only deprive people of their grandchild, but also deprive my child of his grandparents. She said that he needs the extra support from them, no matter how they acted when my ex was growing up, and mostly just things like that. I guess I understand that point, from an outside perspective, but I’m never going to get rid of that rule, it’s not my rule to get rid of. If my ex eventually feels willing to let his parents meet his son, then sure, the rule is gone, but I’m not breaking that trust simply because it makes my girlfriend upset to think that my child is being ‘deprived’.

Your response:
","I hear your commitment to protecting your child and respecting your ex's wishes regarding his parents. It's clear you take your co-parenting responsibilities seriously and understand the deeper context behind these boundaries.

Your girlfriend may be coming from a place of caring, wanting your child to have more family connections. However, she wasn't there to witness what your ex experienced with his parents, and this isn't simply about ""depriving"" anyone - it's about maintaining healthy boundaries that both you and your ex have thoughtfully established for your child's wellbeing.

You're right that this isn't just your decision to make unilaterally. Co-parenting requires trust and respect for agreements made between parents. If your ex isn't comfortable having his parents involved given their history, that's a valid position that deserves to be honored.

Perhaps helping your girlfriend understand that this boundary comes from a place of protection rather than deprivation could help shift her perspective. But ultimately, you're making responsible choices as a parent by maintaining these boundaries.","

Your response:
","It seems like you're feeling stuck between respecting the boundaries you and your ex established for your son's well-being, and your girlfriend's concerns about depriving your child of his grandparents. You're prioritizing the trust and agreements you have with your ex, which is understandable, especially given the reasons behind those rules. However, I also sense that you're trying to be considerate of your girlfriend's feelings and perspective. 

It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your girlfriend about why this rule is non-negotiable for you, and see if she can understand the context and reasoning behind it. At the same time, you may want to acknowledge her concerns and reassure her that you're not depriving your child of support, but rather, making decisions that prioritize his well-being based on the circumstances.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between two loyalties—one to the family boundaries you set for your son’s well‑being, and another to your girlfriend’s feelings about his grandparents. Both sides have valid concerns. Your ex’s parents may have disappointed you, so you’ve created a protective rule; your girlfriend sees your son’s right to family connection and feels the rule is unfair.  

Try framing the conversation as a shared goal: “I want my son to have a healthy relationship with his family, and I want you to feel comfortable and respected.” Ask what specific aspects of the grandparents’ involvement bother her (e.g., past behavior, boundaries, or just the idea of them). Then discuss realistic limits: perhaps a supervised first visit, or setting clear expectations about how they’ll interact. If that feels too much, propose a compromise like a family‑friendly activity with the grandparents, with your son’s consent.  

If you’re still uncomfortable, keep the rule but make it clear it’s about your son’s safety, not an attempt to control or shame anyone. Transparency and a willingness to revisit the policy when circumstances change can help both of you feel heard and respected.","

z32kuo,AITAH,AITAH for breaking up with my boyfriend before friday so i can go to the bar,catbelly4,"

Recently, i have been so annoyed at my(21f) bf (21m). He never wants to do ANYTHING. He barely wants to hang out in general. We see each other once a week and its usually just us sitting in his room and me watching him sleep. I work and do school from home so i rarely get to leave the house, so on the weekends im dying to do an activity or at least get some sunlight! 

I ask him to go cross country skiing. He says no he doesnt like that. I ask him to go skating. He says he doesnt have skates and doesnt want to buy them for $10 from goodwill. I ask him if he wants to go for happy hour. He doesnt want to spend money. I ask if he wants to predrink at my place and go out with my roommates. He doesnt want to go to the bar. The only thing he'll say yes to is going on a walk, but when it actually comes down to it he wont get up and do it. 

This weekend my roommates are going out but my bf doesnt want me to go (doesnt like me going out without him there, but doesnt want to come with) he said we can go for happy hour instead if i pay. I dont want to spend $100 on a bill (also keep in mind i pay rent, utilities, insurance, gas, groceries while he lives at home and has no bills + rich parents) just for him to want to go home and watch a movie right after, fall asleep and not wake up until 12pm and go home as soon as he wakes up. We never even have sex anymore. 

I feel like im the only one trying to keep the relationship alive and at this point im so turned off i dont even know if i have feelings for him anymore. I know he doesnt want to break up, as anytime i bring up any kind of serious topic he gets anxious and says ""promise you wont leave me"", yet stopped putting effort in. 

Anyways. Ive been working super hard all week and i wanna go out, preferably with him, but he doesnt want to go. Should i just end it?",138,83,1669242492,It's already dead. You just need to give it a decent burial.,241,Mehitabel9,"The question here is why haven't you ended it already.  He doesn't want you to go out with your friends without him but he doesn't want to go out.  Kind of a catch 22 there.  He says he'll go to happy hour if you pay?  Wow, he's so romantic 🤣  Then on top of it, he makes you promise you won't leave him.  He puts zero effort into this relationship or making you happy, so it's time to end it.  Ask him if he thinks it's fair to you to just sit at home and do nothing?  If he says he can't afford it, tell him to get a fucking job.  He's 21, has no job, and lives at home.  Why doesn't he have a job?",11,justsomehvacguy,"It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and stuck in a relationship that isn't meeting your needs right now. It's understandable to want to spend your free time doing activities and enjoying life, especially after working hard all week. Your desire to go out and have fun is valid, and it's important to feel supported and have your needs met in a relationship.

It seems like you've tried to communicate and suggest various activities, but your boyfriend isn't willing to engage or compromise, which can be really disappointing. It's also concerning that he doesn't want you to go out without him yet doesn't actively participate in shared activities. This dynamic can feel restrictive and stifling.

Before making a decision, consider having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling and what you need from the relationship. If he's unwilling to make changes or meet you halfway, it may be worth reconsidering if this relationship is right for you. Ultimately, you deserve a partner who shares your enthusiasm for life and supports your happiness.","

Your response:
","Based on your description, you're not wrong for wanting to end this relationship. The issues go far deeper than just wanting to go to the bar on Friday - there's a clear pattern of incompatibility in lifestyle, effort, and communication. Your boyfriend shows signs of being controlling (not wanting you to go out without him) while simultaneously being unwilling to participate in activities with you.

You're young and seem to have a healthy desire for social interaction, activities, and experiences. Meanwhile, your boyfriend appears to be showing signs of possible depression (excessive sleeping, lack of interest in activities, anxiety about abandonment) while also not taking steps to address these issues.

The financial imbalance and one-sided effort you describe are additional red flags. You shouldn't feel guilty about ending a relationship that isn't meeting your needs. Being single would likely be better than feeling trapped in a relationship where you're the only one making an effort.

Consider having an honest conversation about your concerns first, but if nothing changes, breaking up seems like a reasonable choice - regardless of whether it's before Friday or not.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling incredibly frustrated and unfulfilled in your relationship. You're describing a pattern where you initiate activities and try to plan things, but your boyfriend consistently declines or shows no enthusiasm. It's understandable that you'd feel like you're carrying the weight of the relationship on your own and that your efforts are going unappreciated.

It's also striking that you mention not feeling attracted to him anymore and wondering if you even have feelings for him. That's a significant concern, and it's worth exploring whether this relationship is still serving you.

Breaking up with him before Friday might be a way for you to assert your needs and desires, especially if you've been feeling suffocated by the lack of effort and excitement in the relationship. However, it's also worth considering whether you've communicated your concerns and feelings clearly to him. Have you had an open and honest conversation about your needs and desires, or is this a pattern you've been tolerating for too long?","

","It sounds like you’re carrying most of the emotional and practical load in this relationship. You’re exhausted, you’re paying all the bills, and you’re the one who’s trying to keep things moving. That’s a lot of imbalance, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling drained and questioning your feelings.

If you’re thinking about ending things, it might be worth having one honest conversation first—share how you’re feeling, ask what he’s willing (or able) to do to change the dynamic. If he’s still unwilling to meet you halfway, breaking up isn’t an act of selfishness; it’s a step toward protecting your own well‑being.

Going to the bar for a bit of relief is fine—you deserve a break. Just be sure the breakup conversation is respectful, and give yourself time to process afterward.","

zbuv2s,AITAH,AITA For not being happy when my boyfriend told me he's thinking of becoming trans?,1m2eeeeee,"So before i start getting bunch of hate, let me explain.   


I (18F) have been in a 2 year relationship with my boyfriend (18M) and he and I understood what we were going into as I grew in a pretty religious Christian household while he lived in a religious Buddhist home. He and I understood what our political views were and moral views were and we were both fine with them. Even before this he came out as Bisexual and I didn't care as i still love him no matter what. Now, i'll make it short and say a few nights ago he told me, he was thinking of transitioning.   


Without a second i felt my stomach twist but not in disgust but... pain? Hurt? Betrayal? I myself don't even know what I felt since i never had to deal with this before.

I also been growing up with two religious parents who drilled all these religious things in my head that it is honestly difficult to forget or take out. So when he asked me if i'd date him if he was a woman, i said not. I said i can't and explained to him why. He soon said then he won't change since he wants to be with me forever.  


I then told him i don't want to do that since i don't want to stop him from being who he truly is meant to be. I don't want to stop him from being the person he's meant to be. He said he needs time as he is still figuring out what he really wants and he'll tell me what he wants to do and that he'll forever love me.

It sounds like you're grappling with a lot—your beliefs, your feelings about change, and your love for your boyfriend. It's important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel uncertain and emotional about this situation.

Your boyfriend's journey is deeply personal, and it's commendable that you're supportive of him exploring his identity, even if it means facing the possibility of a future without him as your romantic partner. It's also important to be honest with yourself about your own boundaries and what you want in a relationship.

Remember, it's okay to seek support for yourself during this time. Talking to someone you trust or a counselor might help you process your feelings. Ultimately, being open, honest, and compassionate with both yourself and your boyfriend will help navigate this challenging time. You're not alone, and it's okay to take the time you need to understand your feelings and what this means for both of you moving forward.","

Q: AITA For not being happy when my boyfriend told me he's thinking of becoming trans?  So before i start getting bunch of hate, let me explain.   


I (18F) have been in a 2 year relationship with my boyfriend (18M) and he and I understood what we were going into as I grew in a pretty religious Christian household while he lived in a religious Buddhist home. He and I understood what our political views were and moral views were and we were both fine with them. Even before this he came out as Bisexual and I didn't care as i still love him no matter what. Now, i'll make it short and say a few nights ago he told me, he was thinking of transitioning.   


Without a second i felt my stomach twist but not in disgust but... pain? Hurt? Betrayal? I myself don't even know what I felt since i never had to deal with this before. I soon slowly started crying as he told me he thinks that is what he wants and explained to me how he's been thinking about this for months.

Your response:
","Your reaction seems completely normal and compassionate. You're showing maturity by:
1. Supporting their exploration of identity while being honest about your own needs
2. Acknowledging that crying and feeling hurt is a natural response to potentially losing a romantic relationship
3. Not trying to control their decision or make them stay as they are for your sake
4. Being clear that while you can't continue romantically if they transition, you'll remain supportive

It's okay to be straight and only interested in men romantically. That's your sexual orientation, just as valid as any other. You're not being transphobic - you're being honest about your orientation while still showing care and support for your partner's journey.

The pain you're feeling is natural - you're potentially losing the romantic relationship you've built together. But you're handling it with grace and maturity by encouraging them to be true to themselves while being honest about your own boundaries.

Remember, there are no villains here - just two people trying to navigate a complex situation with honesty and respect.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're grappling with a mix of emotions, from the initial shock and pain to a deep sense of care for your boyfriend's well-being. Your honesty about your feelings and limitations is admirable. It's natural to struggle with the idea of change, especially when it involves someone you love and care about deeply.

You've also acknowledged the influence of your upbringing and personal beliefs, which can be a challenging aspect to navigate. It's clear that you're trying to separate your feelings from your values and be true to yourself.

In this situation, it doesn't seem like you're the 'asshole.' You've expressed your feelings and concerns in a way that's respectful to your boyfriend's identity and choices. By supporting him while also being honest about your own limitations, you're showing that you care about his happiness and well-being, even if it means that your relationship may change or evolve in the future.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve just been hit with a lot of new information all at once, and that’s completely understandable. Your reaction—pain, confusion, tears—was a natural way to process a sudden shift in the person you’ve been building a life with. It’s also normal to feel conflicted when your personal values and identity intersect with a partner’s evolving sense of self. You’re not automatically the “asshole”; you’re dealing with a big question: can your relationship survive a change that feels like it’s touching the core of who you are? Give yourself permission to explore that without rushing. Talking with a trusted friend, counselor, or a community that respects both your faith and your boyfriend’s journey might help you clarify what you can accept and what feels truly impossible for you. Above all, try to keep the conversation open and honest, while also honoring your own boundaries.","

"
zn6dwk,AITAH,WIBTAH if I ended my marriage because my husband won’t get a vasectomy,Cautious-Summer-5564,"First time posting, but I’m lost in this situation and think I need to just get out of my own head. I’m sorry for the long post and let me just say that I love my husband. My husband (27 M) and I (27 F) have been together for 8 years, married for almost 3. Our entire relationship the burden of birth control has been on me, with him very rarely using a condom. We both wanted kids after marriage and we waited to get married until I was out of college. I was hoping to wait some time after marriage, but he really wanted to start trying right away. We talked it over and decided to just “stop not trying” after marriage. Well we got married January 2020 and pregnant March 2020. I wanted a boy and my husband has always wanted a girl, this is important later. Well I love our beautiful 2 year old son, but if I’m being truthful I had a difficult pregnancy and first year with him. It wasn’t a great time to be pregnant. Pandemic, my preexisting conditions makes any pregnancy high risk, my husband had a shoulder surgery and was out of work so I was the only income working extra hours, and my husband was not adjusting to married life or becoming a dad. At the time he was more interested in his friends, other girls, and his “hobbies” (fixing an old boat, video games, etc). I was basically left to myself to care for my own heath, the babies health, all the cleaning, cooking, and pets to myself. He did get a job and began working while finishing up his own college degree. He wanted me to stay home with the baby since he didn’t actually want to do any of the care for the baby. I agreed because I felt it was time too move onto a better job anyway and I just outgrew my job. We both thought I would go back to work down the road. After our son was born, he didn’t get better it actually got worse. I developed PPD and PPA. It was honestly the most difficult time of my life, and I was alone. I had no help and no support from either family and my husband was basically just a man child I lived with. After hitting an extreme low himself, he got some help. He landed his dream job, and I gave up everything to support him. I gave up my apartment, all my savings, even sold most of my items to finically support his transition into his dream job and his desire to own a home. It was a disaster. We couldn’t afford anything. We lost so much money and he didn’t like this job. I was constantly being harassed by the neighbor, which just made my PPA and PPD worse I think. He found a new job but it was 4 hours away from the only city either of us lived in, and I agreed. We needed a fresh start, so I gave up more. I worked whatever odd end jobs I could with a baby. I sold even more of my things. I supported his career ambitions. This was a year ago. Things have gotten much much better for us since we moved. I wasn’t really on board with another baby since I wanted to go start my career, but my husband really wanted to try for a girl. I was skeptical at first, but finally agreed that our son could use a sibling. Well I got pregnant (currently 25 weeks along) and I’m even more sick with this pregnancy. When we found out we were having another boy, my heart sank. I have a rocking relationship with my mother so it’s not that I feel like I need a daughter because I honestly not sure I would make a good girl mom. I knew my husband would just want to continue until he got a girl. Now my husband has improved with some things, but he still doesn’t help much around the house and only began to make a real effort with our son’s care after we got pregnant again. I know my husband loves our son, he really has started to play and interact with him sooo much more these past few months. I don’t know how else to say it other than I’m done. I love my son, and I’m excited to bring another baby into our family. I wanted these babies. But I’m so sick during pregnancy. I feel like I can’t be as good of a mother or caretaker to my kid while I’m pregnant and I don’t want to do this again. I have thought about this a lot, and after this pregnancy I really want to get my health under control. This is where I might be the AH. I’m overweight, and have been my whole life. But since I have been on birth control, it has been hard to loose any weight except that brief time around when I got married and I wasn’t on birth control. I don’t want to be on birth control anymore. I have two kids and preexisting health concerns. I don’t really care about looks, I want to be healthier. I want to live as long as possible to be here for my babies and stay active with my boys. I don’t want to affect my breastfeeding, and I don’t enjoy any of the side effects from other forms of birth control. I asked my husband if he would think about a vasectomy. He said he would take a week to think about it and talk to friends, and his conclusion is he won’t until he has his daughter. So I’m stuck. I don’t want anymore kids, but my husbands plan is basically to wear me down until I have another kid and hope it’s a girl. I feel this is disrespectful, he is ignoring what I am communicating I need for my body and instead just deciding that his wants are more important. I can get my tubes tied after this one is born. But it is surgery and my husband still can’t regularly take care care of our one kid. How am I suppose to get a surgery done while breastfeeding a baby and caring for a toddler by myself! I’m hurt also. My husband is making me feel like me and our sons won’t ever be enough until he has a daughter. I have given up and sacrificed so much for him and his dreams and his desires. I’m on my second pregnancy, I can’t mentally or emotionally handle another let alone the physical changes pregnancy and birth does. Truth be told I’m still traumatized how he treated me and our son during and after my first pregnancy. Maybe if I had a better experience into motherhood and was more supported I would want more kids. But that’s not how it is. I have told him if having a girl is so important, leave me for someone else who would want to have more babies. I would gladly split custody of our kids 50/50, that would give me some child free time that I could go back to work finally. He insist he doesn’t want that and he loves me. I know condoms are not going to be realistic since he never really used them before so I just don’t know what to do. As we get closer to our due date, every time I mention this issue he gets a bad attitude. He has been oddly more affectionate lately, so I’m not sure if there already is another women or if he just starting to butter me up so I will change my mind about another child. I know this isn’t going to change for me, I simple have given all I can give. If he wants a girl that badly, I think my marriage is over. I love him, I love our family, and I recognize all the effort he is making on being a better father and husband. But I’m heartbroken. WIBTAH to end our marriage?",84,133,1671166261,"YWNBTAH Why are you even questioning this? I have no idea how or why you even married this man in this first place. He doesn’t give to flying figs about you. Someone who loved you would have your health as their first priority no matter what!! Someone who loved you wouldn’t abandon you while you struggled with PPD AND PPA, like wtf… How you didn’t leave him then???

Divorce him and never look back.",14,I_Dream_in_Blue,,0,,"You’re in a very challenging situation, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with everything you’re managing. It seems like you’ve been carrying a heavy load for a long time, both physically and emotionally. Your concerns about not wanting more children and prioritizing your health are valid and important. It's crucial for both partners to be on the same page regarding family planning, and it sounds like this has been a point of tension. Your husband’s reluctance to consider a vasectomy and his desire for a daughter seem to overlook your needs and well-being. It’s not unreasonable to feel hurt and frustrated. Communication and mutual respect are key in any relationship, and it appears you’ve been trying to express your needs clearly. Ending a marriage is a significant decision, and it might be beneficial to seek counseling together to explore these issues further. This could provide clarity and help you both understand each other’s perspectives better. You deserve to feel supported and respected in your relationship, and it’s important to take steps that align with your values and well-being.","

I’m sorry for the long post and let me just say that I love my husband. My husband (27 M) and I (27 F) have been together for 8 years, married for almost 3. Our entire relationship the burden of birth control has been on me, with him very rarely using a condom. We both wanted kids after marriage and we waited to get married until I was out of college. I was hoping to wait some time after marriage, but he really wanted to start trying right away. We talked it over and decided to just “stop not trying” after marriage. Well we got married January 2020 and pregnant March 2020. I wanted a boy and my husband has always wanted a girl, this is important later. Well I love our beautiful 2 year old son, but if I’m being truthful I had a difficult pregnancy and first year with him. It wasn’t a great time to be pregnant. Pandemic, my preexisting conditions makes any pregnancy high risk, my husband had a shoulder surgery and was out of work so I was the only income working extra hours, and my husband was not adjusting to married life or becoming a dad. At the time he was more interested in his friends, other girls, and his “hobbies” (fixing an old boat, video games, etc). I was basically left to myself to care for my own heath, the babies health, all the cleaning, cooking, and pets to myself. He did get a job and began working while finishing up his own college degree. He wanted me to stay home with the baby since he didn’t actually want to do any of the care for the baby. I agreed because I felt it was time too move onto a better job anyway and I just outgrew my job. We both thought I would go back to work down the road. After our son was born, he didn’t get better it actually got worse. I developed PPD and PPA. It was honestly the most difficult time of my life, and I was alone. I had no help and no support from either family and my husband was basically just a man child I lived with. After hitting an extreme low himself, he got some help. He landed his dream job, and I gave up everything to support him. I gave up my apartment, all my savings, even sold most of my items to finically support his transition into his dream job and his desire to own a home. It was a disaster. We couldn’t afford anything. We lost so much money and he didn’t like this job. I was constantly being harassed by the neighbor, which just made my PPA and PPD worse I think. He found a new job but it was 4 hours away from the only city either of us lived in, and I agreed. We needed a fresh start, so I gave up more. I worked whatever odd end jobs I could with a baby. I sold even more of my things. I supported his career ambitions. This was a year ago. Things have gotten much much better for us since we moved. I wasn’t really on board with another baby since I wanted to go start my career, but my husband really wanted to try for a girl. I was skeptical at first, but finally agreed that our son could use a sibling. Well I got pregnant (currently 25 weeks along) and I’m even more sick with this pregnancy. When we found out we were having another boy, my heart sank. I have a rocking relationship with my mother so it’s not that I feel like I need a daughter because I honestly not sure I would make a good girl mom. I knew my husband would just want to continue until he got a girl. Now my husband has improved with some things, but he still doesn’t help much around the house and only began to make a real effort with our son’s care after we got pregnant again. I know my husband loves our son, he really has started to play and interact with him sooo much more these past few months. I don’t know how else to say it other than I’m done. I love my son, and I’m excited to bring another baby into our family. I wanted these babies. But I’m so sick during pregnancy. I feel like I can’t be as good of a mother or caretaker to my kid while I’m pregnant and I don’t want to do this again. I have thought about this a lot, and after this pregnancy I really want to get my health under control. This is where I might be the AH. I’m overweight, and have been my whole life. But since I have been on birth control, it has been hard to loose any weight except that brief time around when I got married and I wasn’t on birth control. I don’t want to be on birth control anymore. I have two kids and preexisting health concerns. I don’t really care about looks, I want to be healthier. I want to live as long as possible to be here for my babies and stay active with my boys. I don’t want to affect my breastfeeding, and I don’t enjoy any of the side effects from other forms of birth control. I asked my husband if he would think about a vasectomy. He said he would take a week to think about it and talk to friends, and his conclusion is he won’t until he has his daughter. So I’m stuck. I don’t want anymore kids, but my husbands plan is basically to wear me down until I have another kid and hope it’s a girl. I feel this is disrespectful, he is ignoring what I am communicating I need for my body and instead just deciding that his wants are more important. I can get my tubes tied after this one is born. But it is surgery and my husband still can’t regularly take care care of our one kid. How am I suppose to get a surgery done while breastfeeding a baby and caring for a toddler by myself! I’m hurt also. My husband is making me feel like me and our sons won’t ever be enough until he has a daughter. I have given up and sacrificed so much for him and his dreams and his desires. I’m on my second pregnancy, I can’t mentally or emotionally handle another let alone the physical changes pregnancy and birth does. Truth be told I’m still traumatized how he treated me and our son during and after my first pregnancy. Maybe if I had a better experience into motherhood and was more supported I would want more kids. But that’s not how it is. I have told him if having a girl is so important, leave me for someone else who would want to have more babies. I would gladly split custody of our kids 50/50, that would give me some child free time that I could go back to work finally. He insist he doesn’t want that and he loves me. I know condoms are not going to be realistic since he never really used them before so I just don’t know what to do. As we get closer to our due date, every time I mention this issue he gets a bad attitude. He has been oddly more affectionate lately, so I’m not sure if there already is another women or if he just starting to butter me up so I will change my mind about another child. I know this isn’t going to change for me, I simple have given all I can give. If he wants a girl that badly, I think my marriage is over. I love him, I love our family, and I recognize all the effort he is making on being a better father and husband. But I’m heartbroken. WIBTAH to end our marriage?.

Your response:
","Based on the dialog example, I'll respond with empathy while addressing the core concerns:

""I can hear how much pain and conflict you're experiencing. You've sacrificed tremendously for your family - your health, career, and personal wellbeing - while feeling unsupported through difficult pregnancies and early parenthood. It's clear you love your husband and children deeply, but you're also at a breaking point regarding your own needs and boundaries.

The issue isn't really just about the vasectomy - it seems to be about feeling unheard and undervalued. Your husband's insistence on having a daughter despite your clear communication about not wanting more pregnancies shows a concerning pattern of prioritizing his desires over your wellbeing.

You're not wrong for wanting to protect your physical and mental health, or for expecting your partner to respect your reproductive choices. This isn't about being an 'asshole' - it's about advocating for yourself after years of putting others first. Have you considered couples counseling to help navigate this conversation before making a final decision about the marriage?""","

Your response:
","I understand that you're feeling torn and hurt in this situation. It seems like you've been shouldering a significant burden in your marriage, from managing birth control to caring for your children and supporting your husband's career ambitions. The fact that your husband is unwilling to consider a vasectomy, despite your health concerns and desires, feels dismissive and disrespectful to you.

It's clear that you've been struggling with the physical and emotional toll of pregnancy, as well as the trauma from your first experience with motherhood. You've also been expressing your needs and boundaries to your husband, but it seems like he's not taking them seriously.

In this context, it's not unreasonable to consider ending your marriage. You deserve to be heard and respected, and it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and health. It's not about being the ""asshole"" or being selfish; it's about recognizing that you've reached a point where you can't continue in this dynamic.

It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns, but it's also important to prioritize your own emotional safety and well-being. If you feel like you've been trying to communicate your needs and haven't been heard, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship and consider what's best for you and your children.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve carried a huge load—physically, emotionally, and financially—while trying to balance your own health and your family’s hopes. That feels exhausting and unfair, and it’s understandable that you’re questioning whether staying in this marriage is sustainable for you.

First, remember that you have a right to decide how many children you want and when you want them. A vasectomy is a permanent, mutually agreed decision; it isn’t something you should feel pressured into. If he’s unwilling to commit to it now, it may be worth exploring whether he truly values your autonomy or if he’s only chasing a specific outcome.

Consider a couples’ or family‑therapy session focused on reproductive goals and division of responsibilities. If that doesn’t shift the dynamic, you might need to evaluate whether the relationship continues to support your health and well‑being. You deserve a partnership that respects your choices and shares the load, not one that leaves you shouldering everything.","

I have told him if having a girl is so important, leave me for someone else who would want to have more babies. I would gladly split custody of our kids 50/50, that would give me some child free time that I could go back to work finally. He insist he doesn’t want that and he loves me. I know condoms are not going to be realistic since he never really used them before so I just don’t know what to do. As we get closer to our due date, every time I mention this issue he gets a bad attitude. He has been oddly more affectionate lately, so I’m not sure if there already is another women or if he just starting to butter me up so I will change my mind about another child. I know this isn’t going to change for me, I simple have given all I can give. If he wants a girl that badly, I think my marriage is over. I love him, I love our family, and I recognize all the effort he is making on being a better father and husband. But I’m heartbroken. WIBTAH to end our marriage?.

wj4le6,AITAH,My (23M) girlfriend (21F) is mad at me because i told her that i don’t organize my plans depending on her,AcanthisittaSharp967,"So I’ve (23M) been with my (21F) gf for almost 2 years. She’s kind of a clingy / needy girl but i love her a lot. We’re serious and we want to eventhually get married in 5 or 6 years. 
During the holidays, she had to go back to her parent’s house in another country for 2 months and a half. She gave me her keys so i could stay in her studio (because i don’t have a place of my own, i’m in the military so there’s either in the dorms or at my mom’s place). She was kind enough to give me her keys, she didn’t ask for any money to pay the bills (i didn’t offer also ) and she also gave me her mom’s laptop so that i could start my small business. 

However everything has gone down hill and i don’t know who is at fault…
She came home from her parent’s house friday. But before that on wednesday I told her that i was supposed to go sleep over at a friend’s house, and that i was supposed to stay there until friday, but I decided i would be home on thursday night, the day before she was supposed to come back.
She answered « well yeah especialy cuz i’ll be here friday morning 😂 ! » which i already knew. I told her that it was not for her that I shortened my stay at my friend’s house, i quote : « Don’t imagine that I organize my plans around you ». She answered that it’s not what she meant, but because we hadn’t seen each other in 2 months and a half it was rude to say that and that it is normal for her to expect me to be there when she arrives. And even if i cancelled my stay on friday because of another reason than her i shouldn’t have told her that she doesn’t matter in my process of making plans…
So thé conversation got heated and i callee her too dramatic, easily offended and a psychorigid. 
She told me she was disappointed by my reaction and by the things i told her. She tried to talk to me to get me to understand but i told her i would never apologize cuz i had no bad intention, and because it didn’t mean that i am not looking forward to see her.
So she was cold from thursday to friday and when she came from the airport on friday she was visibly colder than usual. 
She told me that we should talk about it and i just got mad and told her that it was really inappropriate for her to be mad the day that we see eachother after 2,5 months. She told me that she was mad because i didn’t even offer to pick her up from the airport and she had to pay an uber for herself, and because there wasn’t any food in the house. I told her that i was supposed to go out after she arrived to buy her flowers and buy food but she ruined everything by coming in mad and wanting to talk about something so insignificant. Anyways it really got heated and i said some rude things but she was kind of getting my heated for nothing.
I simply don’t get why she’s mad since i had no bad intentions and already told her i won’t apologize.
Sorry for my crooked english lol
TL;DR: my girlfriend in mad at me because i told her that i do not plan my life around her",0,212,1659951411,YTA how can you be so rude and selfish. How can you stay at her house for free (didnt even suggested to pay atleast half of it) and don't even offer to pick her up from the airport.,115,Feisty-Ad-6822,YTA she let you stay at her house free of bills.  You couldn't even puck her up at the airport.,8,Professional_Grab513,"It sounds like there's a lot going on here, and it's understandable that emotions are running high given the situation. From what you've shared, it seems like your girlfriend values feeling important in your life and was hurt by your comment about not organizing your plans around her. While you didn't have bad intentions, it might have come across as dismissive of her feelings, especially after being apart for so long.

Communication is key in relationships, and it might help to have an open conversation where you both listen to each other's perspectives. Acknowledging her feelings and explaining your side without placing blame could be a good start. It’s not just about the intention behind your words, but also how they were received. 

Consider how you might feel if roles were reversed. Taking the time to understand her point of view and expressing your own could help bridge the gap. Apologizing doesn't necessarily mean admitting fault; it can also mean recognizing the impact your words had and showing that you care about her feelings.","

Your response:
","Based on the example dialog, I'll respond with empathy while addressing the core issue:

I hear that you're frustrated because you feel your girlfriend is overreacting to what you meant as a simple statement. However, let's look at the situation from her perspective - she's been away for 2.5 months, let you stay in her place, shared her resources (laptop, utilities), and was likely really looking forward to seeing you.

When you said ""Don't imagine that I organize my plans around you,"" it probably felt dismissive of her importance in your life, especially after she's shown such trust and generosity. While you didn't intend to hurt her, sometimes impact matters more than intention. In a serious relationship, it's normal to consider your partner when making plans, not as a restriction but as part of caring for them.

Instead of defending your intention, perhaps try understanding why she felt hurt. The airport pickup and empty fridge situation suggests she was hoping for some gesture showing you missed her too. Would you be open to having a calm conversation about both of your expectations in the relationship?","

Your response:
","It sounds like a complicated situation with many factors at play. On one hand, you feel like you were being honest with your girlfriend, and you don't see why she's so upset. On the other hand, it seems like your words may have come across as insensitive, especially considering you hadn't seen each other in a long time.

It's possible that your girlfriend felt like you were dismissing her importance in your life, and that's what hurt her. Even if you didn't mean it that way, it's clear that your words had a significant impact on her. I think it's worth considering that her feelings might not be about the literal meaning of your words, but about how they made her feel.

It might be helpful to try to see things from her perspective and understand why she's feeling this way. Instead of getting defensive and refusing to apologize, maybe try to have a calm and honest conversation with her about what happened. It's possible that you both just need to clear the air and work through your feelings together.","

Your response:
","It sounds like the two of you are both feeling hurt and misunderstood. She’s been away for months and probably expected to feel welcome and supported when she returned—especially after giving you space to stay at her studio, laptop, and all that. When you said you “don’t organize my plans around her,” it likely sounded like you’re saying she isn’t a priority, even if that wasn’t your intention.  

Instead of shutting down the conversation, try to listen first: ask her what specifically made her feel unvalued and let her finish without interjecting. Acknowledge that her feelings are valid, then explain your own constraints (military duty, limited time, etc.) and that you didn’t mean to dismiss her. A simple apology (“I’m sorry if my words hurt you”) can reset","

y4876k,AITAH,AITAH? I am not innocent but I am also at a loss and need some advice,Illustrious_Mine_800,"AITAH? I am not innocent but I am also at a loss and need some outsider insight. I have been with my husband for 17 years married for 3. We have two girls together ages 13 and 6. I have never gotten along with his parents. I don’t like them as people. I find them to be passive aggressive, manipulative and pot stirrers who love on drama. My most recent interaction with them that has thrown me over the edge happened in April. My family is catholic. I grew up in the Catholic Church and my kids are catholic. My oldest has been going to religion classes since first grade. Has had her first holly communion in second grade and is preparing for her confirmation. My youngest was in kindergarten at the time of the event and is now attending religion classes too. My youngest had slept over my in laws one night. My MIL had taken her to her Lutheran church that morning. Fine nothing wrong with that. When we went to pick her up my MIL told her to tell us what she did at church this morning with the smug look on her face. My daughter proceeded to tell us that she accepted communion. I immediately saw red. I said you did what?  My daughter said accepted the body of Christ. I looked over at my MIL and she was looking at me like f””k you what are you going to do about it. She then went off on this tangent about how it only matters if you are catholic. In the Lutheran church you can receive at any time. I as politely as possible said she is catholic and it does matter. We then promptly left. Outside my husband said he would talk to his mom and take care of it. Well the next day he first talked to hi dad and his aunt about what happened. They both were in agreement that she didn’t do it on purpose and it was an accident. I told him that if he had been paying attention the day before he would have seen her face and attitude and there is no way it was an accident. I told him I wanted an apology and our children will never go to church with her again. He waited all day to talk to her and as the day went on I was getting more upset because I knew he wasn’t going to talk to her because he has never put her in her place when she has overstepped boundaries in the past. He finally got her on the phone around 5 and she had the audacity to start yelling at him about how dare he call her out. She doesn’t see anything wrong with what she did and claimed she didn’t realize the girls were catholic which is a load of crap because she was there when the both of them were baptized in a Catholic Church and my oldest first holy communion. She said she felt she was doing the right thing because as she saw it the girls didn’t have god in their lives. She proceeded to tell him that I could go f””k myself and she will never apologize. Three days later she texted me telling me she was conflicted about reaching out. She then went on to explain what happened. Which I responded to I know what happened and I am still waiting for an apology. She never apologized though and has been acting like nothing is wrong for the past months.   I can’t stand being around her. I don’t want to talk to her interact with her or let my kids be alone with her. My husband says she is never going to apologize and to just get over it but I can’t. This was the straw that broke the camels back. My husband and I have been trying for a third baby and it has not been going well. The other day we had seen his parents and I again ignored them. The next night I told my husband I was ovulating and we should or have some intimate time. He turned around and said I have something you want now you can do something I want and be nice to my parents. I said to him that we had agreed never to use that as a weapon agains each other and I can’t believe what he just said. He said well then I don’t want to have another kid with you. I am beyond broken and now can’t stand the look of my husband and have been sleeping in the guest bedroom. I fell all alone.",85,116,1665789101,For heavens sake do not have another child with this man.

You're caught in a difficult situation where you're feeling disrespected by your in-laws and unsupported by your husband. It's understandable to feel hurt and betrayed, especially when it seems like your boundaries and values are not being respected. The conflict with your mother-in-law over religious practices and the subsequent reactions have understandably added a lot of tension to your relationship with your husband. 

It's crucial to have open and honest communication with your husband about how you're feeling. Consider expressing your feelings without assigning blame, focusing on how these events have impacted you emotionally. Couples therapy could also be a helpful step to navigate these issues together and to find a way to rebuild trust and understanding. Remember, it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being and to seek support from friends, family, or a professional if you need it. You deserve to feel respected and supported in your relationship.","

I immediately saw red. I said you did what?  My daughter said accepted the body of Christ. I looked over at my MIL and she was looking at me like f””k you what are you going to do about it. She then went off on this tangent about how it only matters if you are catholic. In the Lutheran church you can receive at any time. I as politely as possible said she is catholic and it does matter. We then promptly left. Outside my husband said he would talk to his mom and take care of it. Well the next day he first talked to hi dad and his aunt about what happened. They both were in agreement that she didn’t do it on purpose and it was an accident. I told him that if he had been paying attention the day before he would have seen her face and attitude and there is no way it was an accident. I told him I wanted an apology and our children will never go to church with her again. He waited all day to talk to her and as the day went on I was getting more upset because I knew he wasn’t going to talk to her because he has never put her in her place when she has overstepped boundaries in the past. He finally got her on the phone around 5 and she had the audacity to start yelling at him about how dare he call her out. She doesn’t see anything wrong with what she did and claimed she didn’t realize the girls were catholic which is a load of crap because she was there when the both of them were baptized in a Catholic Church and my oldest first holy communion. She said she felt she was doing the right thing because as she saw it the girls didn’t have god in their lives. She proceeded to tell him that I could go f””k myself and she will never apologize. Three days later she texted me telling me she was conflicted about reaching out. She then went on to explain what happened. Which I responded to I know what happened and I am still waiting for an apology. She never apologized though and has been acting like nothing is wrong for the past months.   I can’t stand being around her. I don’t want to talk to her interact with her or let my kids be alone with her. My husband says she is never going to apologize and to just get over it but I can’t. This was the straw that broke the camels back. My husband and I have been trying for a third baby and it has not been going well. The other day we had seen his parents and I again ignored them. The next night I told my husband I was ovulating and we should or have some intimate time. He turned around and said I have something you want now you can do something I want and be nice to my parents. I said to him that we had agreed never to use that as a weapon agains each other and I can’t believe what he just said. He said well then I don’t want to have another kid with you. I am beyond broken and now can’t stand the look of my husband and have been sleeping in the guest bedroom. I fell all alone..

Your response:
","I hear how deeply hurt and isolated you're feeling right now. This situation has clearly become much bigger than just the communion incident - it's about respect, boundaries, and feeling supported by your husband. What's particularly concerning is how your husband is now using intimacy and family planning as leverage, which is crossing a serious line in your marriage.

The religious boundary violation by your MIL was significant, and your feelings about it are valid. However, it seems like the bigger issue here is the pattern of disrespect and your husband's inability or unwillingness to stand with you in maintaining healthy boundaries with his parents.

While I can't tell you if you're ""the AH,"" I can suggest that this situation might benefit from professional help - either marriage counseling or family therapy. This could provide a safe space to address both the immediate conflict and the deeper issues of family dynamics, boundaries, and communication.

You're not alone in struggling with in-law relationships, but using intimacy as a weapon and dismissing your valid concerns isn't okay. Your feelings matter, and you deserve to have them acknowledged and respected.","

Your response:
","You're feeling deeply hurt and betrayed by your husband's reaction to the situation with his mother, and now it's affecting your relationship. It sounds like you're not just upset about the incident itself, but also about the fact that your husband isn't standing up for you or his own family's values. You're feeling like he's prioritizing his mother's feelings over yours and your children's.

It's understandable that you can't just ""get over it"" when you feel like your boundaries and values are being disrespected. It's also concerning that your husband is using intimacy as a bargaining chip, which can be damaging to your relationship. It's like he's trying to control your behavior by withholding affection, rather than having an open and honest conversation about your feelings.

I think it's essential to have a calm and honest conversation with your husband about how his behavior is affecting you. You need to express your feelings and concerns, and work together to find a resolution that respects both of your needs. It might also be helpful to consider couples therapy to work through these issues and strengthen your relationship.","

Your response:
","It’s clear you’re hurting and feel blindsided by your mother‑in‑law’s comments and your husband’s reaction. The hurt you felt when your daughter’s faith was dismissed is legitimate, and the lack of an apology or support from your husband compounds that pain. You’re not “the asshole” for protecting your family’s beliefs or for being upset about someone who doesn’t respect them. That said, your husband’s use of your intimate time as a bargaining chip and his dismissal of your feelings is disrespectful and a form of emotional manipulation. You deserve boundaries—both with your in‑laws and with your husband. Consider couples counseling to address his reaction, set clear limits with the in‑laws (or arrange alternate childcare), and if he continues to undermine you, you may need to reevaluate the relationship. You deserve respect and support.","

z9aua4,AITAH,Am I expecting too much?,Impossible_Fox_1640,"I don’t know where to start…. I am currently on maternity leave (6 months), and sick. My husband will not help me out whatsoever. Asking him to do anything is like pulling teeth or he scoffs and gets passive aggressive if he does something. 

The past few days I have been barely been able to get out of bed, I feel so weak I can barely walk. My husband’s excuse for not being able to help is “he is working” (he works from home). Am I expecting too much for him to take a sick day and help out? 

I mentioned to him that I should probably go to the doctor since it’s been more than a few daysand I am not getting better (our baby is showing no symptoms of being sick) 
He scoffed and said “Why? You are fine”. 

Before I got sick he wouldn’t help out with the baby at all either saying “your on leave, I’m working”. And when he would be done with work all he does is play video games or leaves the house to go play rec games 2x a week. I told him I can’t take care of the baby and be the only one to do everything around the house. I haven’t been taking care of myself, he notices that. He gets mad at me and yells at me saying I need to take care of myself so I can take care of the baby. I can’t make myself food though because the baby has to be held. If I put the baby down and try and make something for myself he comes in the room, scoops up the baby all passive aggressive. Or if I ask him to make me dinner his excuse is always related to video games and how he is playing “1 more game” and next thing you know it’s 2 hours later and I am in bed. 

AITA for “expecting too much”? He makes me feel like I cannot ask for help from him.

It’s one thing to take care of a pregnant wife and quite another when baby arrives, since now he isn’t getting attention and praise for being a good husband (though I bet if you look back he wasn’t that amazing then either). The fact that he’s showing contempt for you is the most worrisome part and if he’s not willing to change that I would consider leaving.",114,EightEyedCryptid,"It sounds like you’re going through an incredibly challenging time, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed and frustrated. Expecting your husband to help out, especially when you’re sick and caring for a newborn, is not too much to ask. Parenting is a partnership, and both parents need to support each other, especially during difficult times.

It seems like there has been a significant change in your husband's behavior since your baby was born, and it’s important to address this. Have you had a direct conversation with him about how you’re feeling and what you need from him? Sometimes, people don’t realize the full extent of the situation until it’s explicitly communicated.

Consider seeking support from friends, family, or even a counselor who can provide guidance on how to navigate this situation. Your health and well-being are essential, not only for you but also for your baby. It's crucial to prioritize seeing a doctor if you're unwell. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve support, and it's okay to insist on it.","

Your response:
","No, you're absolutely not expecting too much, and I hear how isolated and unsupported you're feeling right now. The dramatic shift in your husband's behavior from pregnancy to now must feel particularly jarring and hurtful.

What you're describing - being sick while caring for an infant alone, unable to even prepare food for yourself, while your husband dismisses your health concerns and prioritizes video games - is deeply concerning. Your needs for basic care and support, especially while ill, are completely reasonable. A partnership, particularly with a new baby, requires both parents to participate in caregiving.

Your husband's dismissive responses to your illness and needs, along with his passive-aggressive behavior, suggest there might be deeper issues that need addressing. His comment about you needing to ""take care of yourself"" while actively preventing you from doing so shows a concerning disconnect.

Have you considered speaking with your healthcare provider not just about your physical symptoms, but also about the lack of support at home? They can often provide resources and support for new mothers in difficult situations.","

","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and unsupported right now, and that's completely understandable. It's not unreasonable to expect help from your partner, especially when you're recovering from illness and caring for a newborn. It's concerning that he's making you feel like you can't ask for help, and that he's not taking your needs seriously.

It's interesting that you mention things were different during your pregnancy. It's possible that your husband had a different expectation of what his role would be during that time, and now that the baby is here, he's struggling to adjust.

Rather than wondering if you're expecting too much, I would ask you to consider what you need right now to feel supported and cared for. What specific help would make a big difference to you, and how can you communicate those needs to your husband in a way that feels clear and non-judgmental?","

And when he would be done with work all he does is play video games or leaves the house to go play rec games 2x a week. I told him I can’t take care of the baby and be the only one to do everything around the house. I haven’t been taking care of myself, he notices that. He gets mad at me and yells at me saying I need to take care of myself so I can take care of the baby. I can’t make myself food though because the baby has to be held. If I put the baby down and try and make something for myself he comes in the room, scoops up the baby all passive aggressive. Or if I ask him to make me dinner his excuse is always related to video games and how he is playing “1 more game” and next thing you know it’s 2 hours later and I am in bed. 

AITA for “expecting too much”? He makes me feel like I cannot ask for help from him.

I just feel like I am a single parent, and everything was the complete opposite during my pregnancy. He was amazing..

Your response:
","I hear how exhausted and alone you’re feeling—sleep, food, and the baby all piling up while you’re already ill. It’s not “too much” to ask your husband to step up, especially when he’s literally your only adult support. Your expectations are grounded in self‑care and the well‑being of your little one.

Try a calm, concrete conversation: say, “I’m sick, I can’t be active, and I need someone to hold the baby so I can get food and rest. If you can take a 30‑minute shift right now, I’ll be able to recover faster.” Give him a clear, limited ask rather than a vague “help me.” If he resists, remind him that you’re both parents, not just a “baby‑care” partner. If he continues to withdraw, consider reaching out to family, a doula, or a community support group for postpartum care. Also, schedule a doctor’s visit—your health matters, and a professional can rule out anything serious.

You’re not over‑expecting; you’re simply asking for the basic","

New personal Query: 

Q: Am I expecting too much?  I don’t know where to start…. I am currently on maternity leave (6 months), and sick. My husband will not help me out whatsoever. Asking him to do anything is like pulling teeth or he scoffs and gets passive aggressive if he does something. 

The past few days I have been barely been able to get out of bed, I feel so weak I can barely walk. My husband’s excuse for not being able to help is “he is working” (he works from home). Am I expecting too much for him to take a sick day and help out? 

I mentioned to him that I should probably go to the doctor since it’s been more than a few daysand I am not getting better (our baby is showing no symptoms of being sick) 
He scoffed and said “Why? You are fine”.

It's important to recognize that friendships, regardless of the sexual orientation of those involved, can provide essential support and connection. Your husband's laughter and joy seem to stem from this friendship, which might be a positive influence on him. 

It might be helpful to have an open, honest conversation with your husband about your feelings without judgment. Express your concerns and listen to his perspective as well. Understanding each other's viewpoints can help find a balance that respects your marriage and your husband's friendships. Perhaps exploring common activities that include both of you and his friend, or even getting to know his friend better, could ease some of your concerns and help integrate this aspect of his life into yours more comfortably.","

Your response:
","I hear that you're feeling threatened by your husband's close friendship, and you're trying to reconcile this with your religious values. However, I sense there might be deeper concerns here beyond just his friend's orientation. It sounds like you're perhaps feeling excluded or worried about the amount of emotional intimacy your husband shares with someone else, even if they're just friends.

It's worth reflecting on why this particular friendship makes you uncomfortable. Your husband clearly values this decades-long relationship that predates your marriage, and his friend seems to be an important part of his support system. Asking him to end or limit a meaningful friendship could damage your relationship with your husband and cause him significant pain.

Rather than focusing on his friend's sexuality or trying to change their friendship, perhaps explore ways to feel more included and secure in your relationship with your husband. Have you shared with him your feelings of being left out when they're sharing jokes and conversations?","

","It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of feelings about your husband's close friendship with his gay best friend. On one hand, you mention that you don't have anything against gay people, but on the other, you're uncomfortable with the casual conversations about his friend's relationships. It seems like your conservative Christian values are influencing your perspective on this situation. 

I sense that you're not just concerned about the friendship itself, but also about how it might reflect on your marriage and your shared values. It's possible that you're feeling a bit insecure or worried that your husband's close bond with his friend might be a point of tension or difference in your relationship. 

It might be helpful to explore these feelings with your husband in a more open and non-judgmental way. Instead of asking him to focus on other friendships, you could try having a conversation about why this friendship makes you uncomfortable and what it is about it that's causing tension for you. By doing so, you might be able to gain a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives and find a way to navigate this situation together.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re juggling a mix of affection for your husband and a lingering unease about his friendship. You’re not alone—many couples feel that way when a partner’s close friendship seems “outside the box.” Your husband’s own words (“brother,” “normal”) suggest he sees this bond as a platonic, supportive relationship, not a threat to your marriage. That said, your feelings are valid; it’s normal to want reassurance about where his emotional focus lies.

A gentle next step is to invite a calm conversation: share specific moments that made you uneasy, not accusations, and ask how he envisions balancing the friendship with family time. You might also suggest setting gentle boundaries—e.g., limiting late‑night texts or scheduling regular family activities—to give everyone a sense of structure. Remember, trust grows when both partners openly discuss limits and respect each other’s comfort zones. If the tension persists, a couples‑therapy session could help you both understand and honor each other’s needs.","

","I hear how disturbing and painful this experience was for you. It's concerning that your girlfriend deliberately caused you physical pain after you expressed trust in her, and then dismissed your feelings by calling you names. This isn't about being ""sensitive"" - intentionally hurting someone, especially a partner who trusts you, is never okay. Your reaction to end the relationship shows you recognize this crossed an important boundary.

The fact that she showed no remorse and instead mocked you for being hurt makes this even more troubling. You're not being overly sensitive - your body autonomy was violated and your trust was betrayed. Anyone would feel hurt and upset in this situation.

You had every right to end a relationship where your partner deliberately caused you pain and showed no respect for your boundaries or wellbeing. This isn't about gender or strength - it's about basic respect and trust between partners.","

It's understandable that you would feel upset and want to end the relationship after being hurt in that way. However, it's also possible that your girlfriend didn't realize the severity of what she had done, and her comment about you being a ""pussy"" indicates a lack of empathy.

yjz6oa,AITAH,"AITA for not accepting being a ""nanny""?",Complete27anonym,"I (F26) am dating a man (M30), and have been doing it for the last 3 months.

Taking on the responsibility of caring for someone else's family member, especially when you barely know them and have only been dating for three months, is a significant commitment that could indeed compromise your independence. It’s important to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs and aspirations, especially since you moved to a new country to be independent. Your decision to not take on the role of a ""nanny"" doesn’t make you unreasonable—it shows that you are aware of your own limits and are prioritizing your well-being. It's commendable that you had a clear and honest conversation about your boundaries and, when that wasn’t respected, chose to walk away. It’s crucial to be in a relationship where both partners' needs and boundaries are respected. You’ve made a choice that aligns with your values, and that’s important for your personal growth and happiness.","

Your response:
","I hear how conflicted this situation has made you feel. It's clear you value your independence, which you worked hard to achieve by moving to a new country. Your boyfriend's request puts you in a difficult position - asking you to take on a huge responsibility for someone you've never met, who you can't even communicate with, after only 3 months of dating.

Your hesitation and refusal don't make you an asshole at all. In fact, it shows good judgment to recognize that this arrangement would be inappropriate and potentially harmful for everyone involved. It's concerning that your boyfriend would pressure you into such a serious commitment so early in the relationship, essentially asking you to be an unpaid caregiver for his sister.

I'm glad to see from your edit that you stood firm in your boundaries and ended the relationship when he wouldn't respect your decision. That took courage and self-respect. Trust your instincts - they're serving you well in protecting your independence and wellbeing.","

Your response:
","It seems like you're feeling overwhelmed and disrespected by your partner's request. On one hand, he's presenting this idea as a favor to his sister and an opportunity for you to live together, but on the other hand, it's clear that this would be a massive responsibility for you. You've expressed your desire for independence, and it sounds like this arrangement would undermine that. I think it's reasonable that you would feel hesitant and even resistant to taking on a role that you didn't sign up for, especially given the language barrier and lack of space in his current home. Your feelings and concerns seem valid, and it's not surprising that you ended things when he couldn't understand or respect your boundaries.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve been honest about your boundaries from the start, which is exactly what a healthy relationship needs. You’re not “bad” for saying you don’t want to take on a caregiving role that could make you feel dependent again. Your partner’s insistence—especially after you’ve explained your concerns—crosses into pressure, and his anger when you refuse shows a lack of respect for your autonomy.

In a partnership, each person should feel free to decline responsibilities that don’t fit their life. If he can’t accept that, it’s reasonable to step away. You’ve done the right thing by ending things after he kept insisting. Going forward, keep setting clear limits and communicate them early; it protects both your independence and the relationship’s integrity.","

ynept5,AITAH,aitah for fat shaming my cousin?,opheliaophelia_,"Edit: Since I'm getting tired of replying to the same comments over and over. I'll be rewriting the story - the original will still be there, scroll down. 

I 15F decided around December 2021, I'll be living a healthier lifestyle and start going to the gym. To which a few months later, I was fitter than I was before. I have a cousin, 17F, who is obese. She was already born with fat on her, but over the years it gradually built up. She knew I go to the gym but didn't comment on anything until a few months later. Whenever I was around her, usually at family events. She'd say something like, ""try a burger,"" or shit like that. Shaming for having a skinny body, and my lifestyle decisions. 

The whole event happened at my aunt's birthday party, which happened to be her mom. I was sitting down in the living room, eating carrots. When my cousins (Her and her little sister, 15F) and their friends came up to me. My cousin made a comment along the lines of, ""Carrots? Any more you'll be looking like that girl from Squidgame."" (They're talking about Hoyeon Jung, who is a skinny person, to what I've seen online, also gets body shamed.) They started giggling, some smiling. It honestly annoyed me and was seriously my breaking point. Any chances they have, they'll make a stupid remark. So I replied with something along the lines of, "" At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest, will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually I’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking you guys are causing."" I was happy so I smiled, almost laughed because suddenly the motherfuckers were quiet. However, her mother heard me, who happens to be also obese. She walked over to us, to yell at me for insulting her daughters and friends in front of her, and in her own house. As if they weren't just insulting me, and she didn't do shit. Which pissed me off even more, so I make a remark. ""Chill, quit stomping, you'll break the floors you pig."" Some of the guests were looking at us, and some are doing their own things. At this point, she and her daughters started yelling at me but honestly, I didn't listen. I'm guessing one of the other guests told my parents and they quickly went inside. My aunt started berating my mother for raising such a disrespectful daughter, the irony. I couldn't stop myself, so I created another comment, something like, ""OMG, it's getting so crowded the fuck, quit taking all the space will yah?"" We got kicked out after. My parents were mad at first, not because I insulted my cousins, but because I caused a scene in front of people. Besides, my dad doesn't like them either, we're only keeping in contact because she's my mom's cousin. Also, my mom does not like conflict, and that's why most of the time I ignored it. Nor do I like confronting people. You see, in their eyes, there is no such thing as body shaming skinny people because they are society's standard. Therefore it's okay, in their minds to shame them. Also, my aunt does not like to discipline them in any way, she enables their actions to the point at their grown-ass age, they whine and make a scene like kids when they don't get things their way. 

Anyways, this might be the final update. I have a life to get to. LOL. I don't regret my actions, I'm going to treat you the same you treat me. And to the people wondering, I only posted this to get people's opinions if body shaming can go both ways. Also, it's honestly sad, at their grown age, they're shaming a 15-year-old. LOL.


OG: 
I know it sounds pretty bad, but please listen. People I know will probably see this but whatever, this is my side of the story. 

I 15F am a skinny person, not that skinny to the point where you can see my bone through my skin. I still have fat, just skinny because I go to the gym. I have a cousin 17F who is obese because she likes to eat. 

I’ll head straight to the point. This hoe likes to make comments on my body. Ex, “Try a burger.”, “You guys hear a skeleton?” (minecraft reference). “You’re withering like Bella.” (twilight reference)., etc… The event happened at my aunts birthday party, her mom. I was sitting down, eating some carrots. When the bitch came up to me, with some of her friends and sister. 

She said something like, “Gee carrots? Anymore, you’ll be looking like that girl from Squid game. There’s meat on the menu.” (not the exact wording, just what I can remember) And for anyone who do not know of the reference, the girl from Squid game, Hoyeon Jung, is a skinny person - look her up. The people that were with her started giggling, they are also big. So I replied with, “At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually i’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking thats happening.” (not exact wording) I smiled, almost giggled at their faces that looked dumbfounded and angry. They were very quiet, and also her mom, heard me say it. Also obese. She got mad me, saying things like how dare I insult her daughters in her own house. I made remark, “YO CHILL! Quit stomping on the floors, you’ll break them you pig.” Not my best moments, I was just pissed off. Everybody was also looking at us. My parents were in the backyard but came to us quickly after someone told them what happened. Everyone came inside also. VERY CROWDED. People were asking us what was going on, while the obese people were yelling at me. I made another remark, “OMG PLEASE ITS SO CROWDED IN HERE, QUIT TAKING ALL THE SPACE WILL YAH?” My family and I got kicked out LOL. At first my parents were mad, until I told them the story, found out my dad didn’t like them ether. Mom told me to be nicer because my aunt is her cousin. LOL. FOUND OUT THAT THE OBESE PEOPLE LEFT OUT THE FACT THEY WERE ALSO BODYSHAMING ME AND ONLY INCLUDED MY REMARKS. SOME WHO KNOW OF THE STORY ARE SAYING YOU CANT BODYSHAME A PERSON THAT IS SOCIETY’S STANDARD. Like WHAT?!? 

Anyways, I honestly don’t care what they think. If you going to body shame me, I’ll do the same. LOL.

Edit: Since i’ve been getting the same comments a lot. I’ll clarify some things.

1. This has been happening for months, a while after I started going to the gym. So maybe around April? I started working out December 2021. 

2. Family watched while they shamed and bullied me, but has done nothing.

3. Their mom, my aunt, does absolutely nothing to discipline them. She knows what they do to me, but take no action.

4. My aunt spoils her daughters, she’ll buy them anything and will not discipline them in anyway. They will complain if they don’t get something they don’t like.",22,161,1667703136,"If you're looking for validation, you were right, you're not getting it here.  ESH. Just because others are assholes doesn't mean you should be.  All you did was prove that no matter how low someone will act. You'll go lower.",57,Pure_Twist3747,if you don’t care why are you here?,18,tinyteefs,"It sounds like you're in a tough situation where ongoing comments about your body have been hurtful and frustrating. It's understandable to feel upset when you're repeatedly targeted, especially by family members who should be supportive. While it's important to stand up for yourself, responding with more hurtful comments can escalate the conflict and cause further division.

Body shaming, whether directed at someone who is skinny or obese, is harmful. It's crucial to address these issues with empathy and understanding rather than retaliating with similar behavior. It might be helpful to have a calm conversation with your cousin and express how her comments make you feel. You could also involve a trusted adult who can mediate the situation and help establish mutual respect.

Remember, everyone has insecurities, and sometimes people project their own onto others. Encouraging open dialogue and setting boundaries can lead to healthier family interactions.","

Your response:
","I understand you were hurt by your cousin's repeated body-shaming comments, and it's natural to feel frustrated when others dismiss skinny-shaming as not being ""real"" body-shaming. However, responding with equally hurtful insults, especially in such a public way, likely didn't help the situation or make you feel better in the long run.

Instead of escalating with fat-shaming comments, consider either:
1. Directly addressing the behavior: ""Those comments about my body are hurtful. Please stop.""
2. Setting boundaries: ""I'm not going to stay around people who make fun of my appearance.""
3. Speaking with other family members or your parents about addressing this pattern of behavior

At 15, you're learning how to handle difficult social situations. While your cousin's behavior was wrong, matching meanness with meanness usually makes things worse. Consider taking the high road next time - not because they deserve it, but because it's better for your own wellbeing and character.

Would you be open to having a calm conversation with your cousin about how her comments affect you?","

The whole event happened at my aunt's birthday party, which happened to be her mom. I was sitting down in the living room, eating carrots. When my cousins (Her and her little sister, 15F) and their friends came up to me. My cousin made a comment along the lines of, ""Carrots? Any more you'll be looking like that girl from Squidgame."" (They're talking about Hoyeon Jung, who is a skinny person, to what I've seen online, also gets body shamed.) They started giggling, some smiling. It honestly annoyed me and was seriously my breaking point. Any chances they have, they'll make a stupid remark. So I replied with something along the lines of, "" At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest, will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually I’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking you guys are causing."" I was happy so I smiled, almost laughed because suddenly the motherfuckers were quiet. However, her mother heard me, who happens to be also obese. She walked over to us, to yell at me for insulting her daughters and friends in front of her, and in her own house. As if they weren't just insulting me, and she didn't do shit. Which pissed me off even more, so I make a remark. ""Chill, quit stomping, you'll break the floors you pig."" Some of the guests were looking at us, and some are doing their own things. At this point, she and her daughters started yelling at me but honestly, I didn't listen. I'm guessing one of the other guests told my parents and they quickly went inside. My aunt started berating my mother for raising such a disrespectful daughter, the irony. I couldn't stop myself, so I created another comment, something like, ""OMG, it's getting so crowded the fuck, quit taking all the space will yah?"" We got kicked out after. My parents were mad at first, not because I insulted my cousins, but because I caused a scene in front of people. Besides, my dad doesn't like them either, we're only keeping in contact because she's my mom's cousin. Also, my mom does not like conflict, and that's why most of the time I ignored it. Nor do I like confronting people. You see, in their eyes, there is no such thing as body shaming skinny people because they are society's standard. Therefore it's okay, in their minds to shame them. Also, my aunt does not like to discipline them in any way, she enables their actions to the point at their grown-ass age, they whine and make a scene like kids when they don't get things their way. 

Anyways, this might be the final update. I have a life to get to. LOL. I don't regret my actions, I'm going to treat you the same you treat me. And to the people wondering, I only posted this to get people's opinions if body shaming can go both ways. Also, it's honestly sad, at their grown age, they're shaming a 15-year-old. LOL.


OG: 
I know it sounds pretty bad, but please listen. People I know will probably see this but whatever, this is my side of the story. 

I 15F am a skinny person, not that skinny to the point where you can see my bone through my skin. I still have fat, just skinny because I go to the gym. I have a cousin 17F who is obese because she likes to eat. 

I’ll head straight to the point. This hoe likes to make comments on my body. Ex, “Try a burger.”, “You guys hear a skeleton?” (minecraft reference). “You’re withering like Bella.” (twilight reference)., etc… The event happened at my aunts birthday party, her mom. I was sitting down, eating some carrots. When the bitch came up to me, with some of her friends and sister. 

She said something like, “Gee carrots? Anymore, you’ll be looking like that girl from Squid game. There’s meat on the menu.” (not the exact wording, just what I can remember) And for anyone who do not know of the reference, the girl from Squid game, Hoyeon Jung, is a skinny person - look her up. The people that were with her started giggling, they are also big. So I replied with, “At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually i’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking thats happening.” (not exact wording) I smiled, almost giggled at their faces that looked dumbfounded and angry. They were very quiet, and also her mom, heard me say it. Also obese. She got mad me, saying things like how dare I insult her daughters in her own house. I made remark, “YO CHILL! Quit stomping on the floors, you’ll break them you pig.” Not my best moments, I was just pissed off. Everybody was also looking at us. My parents were in the backyard but came to us quickly after someone told them what happened. Everyone came inside also. VERY CROWDED. People were asking us what was going on, while the obese people were yelling at me. I made another remark, “OMG PLEASE ITS SO CROWDED IN HERE, QUIT TAKING ALL THE SPACE WILL YAH?” My family and I got kicked out LOL. At first my parents were mad, until I told them the story, found out my dad didn’t like them ether. Mom told me to be nicer because my aunt is her cousin. LOL. FOUND OUT THAT THE OBESE PEOPLE LEFT OUT THE FACT THEY WERE ALSO BODYSHAMING ME AND ONLY INCLUDED MY REMARKS. SOME WHO KNOW OF THE STORY ARE SAYING YOU CANT BODYSHAME A PERSON THAT IS SOCIETY’S STANDARD. Like WHAT?!? 

Anyways, I honestly don’t care what they think. If you going to body shame me, I’ll do the same. LOL.

Edit: Since i’ve been getting the same comments a lot. I’ll clarify some things.

1. This has been happening for months, a while after I started going to the gym. So maybe around April? I started working out December 2021. 

2. Family watched while they shamed and bullied me, but has done nothing.

3. Their mom, my aunt, does absolutely nothing to discipline them. She knows what they do to me, but take no action.

4. My aunt spoils her daughters, she’ll buy them anything and will not discipline them in anyway. They will complain if they don’t get something they don’t like..

Your response:
","I can sense your frustration and anger in your story. It sounds like you felt constantly belittled by your cousin's comments, and that her mother didn't do anything to stop it, which must have been really hurtful. When your cousin made that comment about you eating carrots, it seems like it was the final straw for you, and you felt like you needed to stand up for yourself. 

Your response was certainly sharp, and it's understandable that you wanted to defend yourself. However, I can also see how your words might have been hurtful to your cousin and her mother. It's possible that they didn't realize the impact their words were having on you, and that they felt like you were attacking them.

It's interesting that you mention people saying that you can't body shame someone who is society's standard, as if that somehow justifies what your cousin was doing to you. That doesn't seem fair, and it's good that you're speaking out against it.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and hurt you feel—being teased about your body, especially in front of family, can feel like a personal attack. It’s understandable you responded in the heat of the moment, but shouting back only escalated things. Body‑shaming, whether you’re skinny or heavy, is harmful and unfair. The real issue is that some family members never set boundaries or speak up when it happens, and that can leave you feeling powerless. 

Consider talking privately with a trusted adult—your mom, a school counselor, or another relative—about setting clear limits. If you can share how the comments make you feel, they might see the problem more clearly. In the meantime, try to keep your responses calm; it gives you more control and reduces the chance of a bigger fight. You deserve respect, no matter your shape","

"
x32s91,AITAH,AITA for not allowing my mom to remarry,dazzle_artz23,"READ TILL THE END PLEASE. I EDITED THIS AFTER A FEW COMMENTS MADE ME REALISE THAT I WAS WRONG. READ TILL THE END.

I (18F) and my brother (20M) grew up without a father. Our biological dad left us with our mom when I was about 6 months old. Our grandma helped our mom raise us, so we've never felt like we didn't receive enough love from our family. 

When I was 6, my mom remarried a man from another state. Their marriage didn't go too well and they soon got divorced about 2 years later. I barely remember him, but I remembered what he said before he left us. He said that he would be going for a meeting in another state and would be back in a year, but he never did. That traumatised me. I became afraid to get attached to people, only for them to leave me one day. 

Now, almost 10 years after she got divorced, my mom had found an old friend from university. They became friends again and were thinking about marriage. As far as I know, she kept in contact with him but would only talk to him from time to time. Starting about 3 months ago, they became closer. 

My mom is 51 years old. My brother and I are now in university (I just entered uni while my brother is already in his 2nd year). My brother still lives with our mom since his uni is only 30 mins from our home. I went to a uni in another state which is like 4-5 hours from home.

This man - let's call him Adam - lives about an hour from my uni. I've been living here for only a month and my mom is now visiting me. She will be here for another 4 days. 

My mom told me that she wants to marry Adam, but she wants to get her family's blessing first. Her mom (my grandma) disagreed while my brother agreed, but he was also afraid that history would repeat and our mom would get divorced again. He was willing to try to accept Adam as our mom's husband though. 

I, on the other hand, really disagreed with this idea. I don't want to have a new step dad because I was afraid that he would leave us just like my bio dad and previous step dad did. I also don't want my mom to go through the same pain again. 

My mom and I had a talk. She accepted the fact that her family didn't really want her to remarry. She told me that she was lonely and was jealous of her friends who have loving husbands and perfect families. My mom wanted to have a partner too just like everyone else, but of course she would put her family's feelings first before everything else. Even her own feelings. 

I understand that my mom wants to have a perfect family, but does she really need it? Our life is already perfect with just me, my mom, brother and grandma. But sooner or later, we would leave our home and mom would be alone. 

My mom accepted our decision, but I feel awful for being the reason why my mom can't get married with the man she loves. 

Am I being selfish for not wanting my mom to remarry just because I'm afraid that we would be left again?

EDIT: So far most people have been saying that I'm selfish. Right now, I am back at my hostel and my mom would come pick me up again tomorrow evening. I would be spending the weekend with her before she goes back home. There's plenty of time for us to talk. 

When we talked yesterday, my mom knew how mad I was and said not to think about this again. But I just can't stop thinking that I was an asshole to my mom. I said things that I shouldn't have said to her. I was an idiot, I know that. 

I've thought about what all of you said and I agree, I should think about my mom's feelings. Just because she said it's ok that I don't want her to get married, that doesn't mean she's really ok. 

She gave me everything that I wanted. Now, it's my turn to do the same thing for her. I just want the best for her. If this marriage becomes the same as the previous ones, I promise I'll be there for my mom. 

Thank you, kind strangers. I will update my story after I talk to her.",78,103,1662023446,"&gt;Am I being selfish for not wanting my mom to remarry just because I'm afraid that we would be left again?

Yes you are. This isn't about you, it's about your mother. You are an adult now, you have your own life and this man doesn't have to be a father figure if you don't want that. But your mother deserves a chance at love and happiness. You are denying her that just because it might turn out badly? That's a risk in ALL relationships, it doesn't mean people shouldn't try.

Your protectiveness over your mom is evident, and it shows how much you care for her. It's natural to worry about her getting hurt again, but it's also important to recognize her need for companionship and happiness. 

Your mom has been there for you and your brother, and now that you're both growing up and becoming more independent, it's understandable for her to want to focus on her own happiness as well. By acknowledging your fears and expressing them to your mom, you've already taken a step towards understanding and supporting her desires. 

It seems like you're open to reconsidering your stance, and that's a positive sign. Having an open and honest conversation with your mom about her feelings and your concerns could be beneficial for both of you. Remember, relationships are complex, and sometimes taking a leap of faith can lead to wonderful outcomes. Whatever happens, being there for your mom and supporting her will mean the world to her.","

Now, almost 10 years after she got divorced, my mom had found an old friend from university. They became friends again and were thinking about marriage. As far as I know, she kept in contact with him but would only talk to him from time to time. Starting about 3 months ago, they became closer. 

My mom is 51 years old. My brother and I are now in university (I just entered uni while my brother is already in his 2nd year). My brother still lives with our mom since his uni is only 30 mins from our home. I went to a uni in another state which is like 4-5 hours from home.

This man - let's call him Adam - lives about an hour from my uni. I've been living here for only a month and my mom is now visiting me. She will be here for another 4 days. 

My mom told me that she wants to marry Adam, but she wants to get her family's blessing first. Her mom (my grandma) disagreed while my brother agreed, but he was also afraid that history would repeat and our mom would get divorced again. He was willing to try to accept Adam as our mom's husband though. 

I, on the other hand, really disagreed with this idea. I don't want to have a new step dad because I was afraid that he would leave us just like my bio dad and previous step dad did. I also don't want my mom to go through the same pain again. 

My mom and I had a talk. She accepted the fact that her family didn't really want her to remarry. She told me that she was lonely and was jealous of her friends who have loving husbands and perfect families. My mom wanted to have a partner too just like everyone else, but of course she would put her family's feelings first before everything else. Even her own feelings. 

I understand that my mom wants to have a perfect family, but does she really need it? Our life is already perfect with just me, my mom, brother and grandma. But sooner or later, we would leave our home and mom would be alone. 

My mom accepted our decision, but I feel awful for being the reason why my mom can't get married with the man she loves. 

Am I being selfish for not wanting my mom to remarry just because I'm afraid that we would be left again?

EDIT: So far most people have been saying that I'm selfish. Right now, I am back at my hostel and my mom would come pick me up again tomorrow evening. I would be spending the weekend with her before she goes back home. There's plenty of time for us to talk. 

When we talked yesterday, my mom knew how mad I was and said not to think about this again. But I just can't stop thinking that I was an asshole to my mom. I said things that I shouldn't have said to her. I was an idiot, I know that. 

I've thought about what all of you said and I agree, I should think about my mom's feelings. Just because she said it's ok that I don't want her to get married, that doesn't mean she's really ok. 

She gave me everything that I wanted. Now, it's my turn to do the same thing for her. I just want the best for her. If this marriage becomes the same as the previous ones, I promise I'll be there for my mom. 

Thank you, kind strangers. I will update my story after I talk to her..

","Let me reflect what I'm hearing in your story. You're coming from a place of deep love and protection for your mom, but you're also wrestling with the realization that your fear of abandonment might be holding her back from happiness. It's beautiful that you've had this moment of self-reflection and understanding that your mom deserves a chance at love, just as she's given you chances to pursue your own path in life.

The fact that you're willing to reconsider your position and support your mom shows tremendous emotional growth. It's not easy to acknowledge when our fears are driving us to make decisions that might hurt those we love. Your commitment to be there for your mom, regardless of the outcome, is exactly what she needs to hear.

Remember, protecting someone doesn't always mean preventing them from taking risks - sometimes it means supporting them while they pursue what makes them happy, even if we're scared for them.","

Q: AITA for not allowing my mom to remarry  READ TILL THE END PLEASE. I EDITED THIS AFTER A FEW COMMENTS MADE ME REALISE THAT I WAS WRONG. READ TILL THE END.

I (18F) and my brother (20M) grew up without a father. Our biological dad left us with our mom when I was about 6 months old. Our grandma helped our mom raise us, so we've never felt like we didn't receive enough love from our family. 

When I was 6, my mom remarried a man from another state. Their marriage didn't go too well and they soon got divorced about 2 years later. I barely remember him, but I remembered what he said before he left us. He said that he would be going for a meeting in another state and would be back in a year, but he never did.

","I can sense the inner conflict you're experiencing. On one hand, you're driven by a desire to protect your mom from potential pain, drawing from past experiences with your biological dad and previous stepdad. On the other hand, you're realizing that your actions and words may have hurt your mom and stifled her desire for companionship.

It's admirable that you're taking the time to reflect on your actions and consider your mom's feelings. Recognizing that your mom's acceptance of your decision may not necessarily mean she's truly okay with it shows empathy and understanding. It's clear that you care deeply for your mom and want the best for her.

It's also heartening to see that you're open to reevaluating your stance and having an honest conversation with your mom. By doing so, you're taking the first step towards healing and growth, both for yourself and your relationship with your mom.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy fear that your mom will repeat a painful pattern, and that fear is shaping how you feel about her future. That’s a legitimate worry, not a trivial “selfishness.” Your mom also has a right to love and companionship, but she can’t give you a divorce‑free future if she’s not ready to cope with a new relationship.  

What might help is a calm, honest conversation: share the specific ways you’d feel unsafe (e.g., lack of communication, sudden absences) and ask her how she plans to address those. Offer to help her find support—counseling or a couples‑pre‑marriage workshop—so both of you can set clear expectations. Remember that mutual respect means listening to each other’s fears and needs, even when they clash. By turning the conversation into a partnership rather than a veto, you’ll show that you love her enough to want the best for both of you.","

It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when your personal space and trust are being challenged, especially when it affects your work and daily routine.

It’s concerning that your husband’s actions led to such distress and that communication between you is turning into arguments rather than constructive discussions. It might be helpful to have a calm conversation about boundaries and mutual respect when emotions have settled.

Your response:
","I hear how distressing and frustrating this situation was for you. Your husband's behavior - claiming to have taken your keys to ""teach you a lesson,"" then denying it, only to have them mysteriously appear - sounds manipulative and concerning. It's understandable that you reached a breaking point and called the police, especially when this affected your work schedule and you spent hours searching.

The fact that this is part of a pattern where things ""turn into screaming lecture or a fight"" suggests there are deeper issues in your relationship. Your husband's actions seem less about key placement and more about control and emotional manipulation. Even his apology turned into another lecture, which shows he's not really acknowledging how his behavior affected you.

Your instinct to leave the situation is worth listening to. This kind of emotional manipulation can be extremely draining and harmful. Have you considered talking to a counselor or domestic violence hotline? They can help you sort through these experiences and provide support for whatever steps you decide to take next.

No, you're not the asshole - your reaction was a reasonable response to an unreasonable situation.","

","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of anger and hurt from a situation that felt very unfair—especially when the police heard the story and didn’t see your side. You’re not a “nutcase”; you’re reacting to a partner who made you feel attacked and then tried to shift blame onto you. That’s a painful pattern, and it’s understandable that you’re exhausted and scared of ending up alone.

First, give yourself permission to step back and breathe. You don’t have to resolve everything in the moment. A short break can help you regain clarity. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend or counselor to talk through the emotional fallout and to work on setting firm boundaries with your husband. If conflict escalates again, keep safety in mind—have a plan for a safe space or a support system to call. You deserve respect and calm, so prioritize your well‑being while you navigate this.","

The cops thought it was weird he pretended to have them and said he moves them because he doesn't like them on my nightstand but he didn't take them this time. They said he could get charged with theft and they miraculously appeared.
The police must think I am a nutcase. I went and got a red bull and it helped.

. They suggested I sleep with my keys. I don't want to stay there any more. Everything turns into screaming lecture or a fight. He apologized but then started lecturing me on the importance of putting my keys in a good place. I told him to fuck off and left..

zitwft,AITAH,My Girlfriend [28F] of 5 years is Very MAD at me [28M] for my decision to travel with my mother [60F],Galatig303,"Context: 
My mother has wanted to travel to The UK for decades but has never had the oppertunity to really do it. Approaching her retirement and wanting to start crossing things of her bucket list she decided this is the year she sees London, England. However, my Father [63M] is Deathly afraid of flying and is stubborn as an Ox. My fathers answer to my mother was a firm ""NO"", this absolutley shattered my mothers dreams. After hearing my mother upset i told her that ""If she cant find someone else to go with her, i will"". Elated at this, she proceeded to book the tickets. 
My mother also adores my Girlfriend, Constantly thinks of her and tries to include her in everything posssible.

Realization:
I Realize i did not discuss this decision with my girlfriend, had i known the timeline between having the conversation with my mother and booking flight tickets was going to be less than a week i would have. I also could have been a little less blunt in telling her that i would be doing this ( The feeling this situation was going to go nuclear gave me anxiety so i kind of just tried to ""rip off the bandaid"")

Arguement:
It went Nuclear.... I said i was sorry for the whole situation and i explained everything to her . Her stance is basically she wanted to go to london for a long time too and despite us planning to book a trip this year ( all inclusive i was looking at booking is a week in Jamaica on a 5 Star Resort that she would not have to pay a dime for as i collect air miles and becauseni want to). shes still upset that she wont get to experience a international flight for the first time with me and emphasiszing that im going to Europe without her even tho she has expressed she wants to go aswell. (Im spending a week in london with my mother doing all the Tourist things) My mother is literally paying for eveything on this trip the only reason we have not booked a trip to the UK or europe is my gf is not exactly in the best finicial position and i can not book a trip to europe for 2 for how i would like to experience it at this time. Let me add that her father is notoriously ""Old School"" i have tried my best to respect him and its only the last Year the he has allowed my gf to spend an overnight weekend with me. 
Basically we are at the point where she needs time away to think and focus on herself. Aswell as experiencing things for herself. We are not broken up but i cant help get the feeling she will resent me for this. This a a Person i have told i want to spend the rest of my life with multiple times, i even bought a ring and was planning to propose this year. 

Ps. I wouldnt really consider myself a ""Mommas boy"" i havent been very nice to my mother in the past and the reality is if i didnt hear her cry or know just how much this trip means to her i would have never offered. All im saying is i could be a better son.

Your mom is paying all of your expenses for Europe.

So you should be able to afford to bring your GF along on this Europe trip?",3,z-eldapin,"It sounds like you’re in a tough spot, trying to balance your mother’s dream with your girlfriend’s feelings. It’s clear you care about both of them deeply, and it’s understandable that you wanted to support your mom, especially given her situation with your father. At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge your girlfriend’s feelings. It seems like she feels left out of a significant experience you’re sharing with someone else, especially since she’s also dreamed of going to London.

Communication might be key here. It could help to reassure your girlfriend that your decision wasn’t meant to exclude her, and perhaps discuss future travel plans together that she can look forward to. Also, consider discussing how you can involve her in this current trip, even if it’s from afar, by sharing your experiences with her or bringing back something special.

Ultimately, showing understanding and empathy towards her feelings while expressing your own intentions might help bridge the gap. It’s important to remember that relationships require compromise and understanding from both sides.","

Your response:
","Let me acknowledge the difficult position you're in. You made a compassionate choice to help fulfill your mother's dream, but the way it unfolded has hurt your girlfriend's feelings.

While your intention to support your mother is admirable, the quick decision-making without consulting your girlfriend has understandably made her feel excluded and overlooked. This is especially sensitive since she's also dreamed of traveling to London.

However, this situation seems to reveal deeper issues about communication, shared dreams, and perhaps some insecurities in your relationship. Your girlfriend's reaction might be less about this specific trip and more about feeling that her wishes and involvement in major decisions aren't being prioritized.

Consider having an open conversation with your girlfriend about:
1. How you can better include her in future decisions
2. Making concrete plans for your own special trip together
3. Finding ways to make her feel secure in your relationship while you're away

You're not necessarily wrong for going with your mother, but the situation could have been handled with more sensitivity and communication upfront.","

Your response:
","You sound genuinely torn and concerned about the situation. It seems like you're caught between being a good son and being a considerate partner. I sense that you care deeply about both your mother and your girlfriend, and you're struggling to navigate this difficult situation.

It's understandable that your girlfriend feels upset, given her own desire to travel to London and experience international flights. However, it's also clear that your decision to accompany your mother was motivated by a desire to support her and make her happy, especially since your father is unable to accompany her.

The fact that you didn't discuss this decision with your girlfriend beforehand and didn't consider her feelings may have contributed to the hurt and resentment she's feeling. However, it's also important to acknowledge that you're trying to be a good son and make amends for past behavior.

It's not necessarily about being a ""momma's boy,"" but rather about being a compassionate and supportive son. It's great that you're taking responsibility for your actions and acknowledging the hurt you may have caused your girlfriend. The fact that you're willing to give her space and time to think and focus on herself is a good starting point for healing and rebuilding your relationship.","

","It sounds like you’re caught between two people who genuinely want something important—your mom’s lifelong dream and your girlfriend’s wish to share a new adventure with you. The core issue isn’t the trip itself; it’s the timing and the lack of conversation. You surprised her by booking without talking, and she’s right to feel left out, especially since she’s been planning a trip together. At the same time, your mother’s emotional break‑up was a shock you wanted to help, and you stepped in to save her dream.

You’re not a monster, but the situation could have been handled with a quick chat: “I’m going with my mom in a week; can we plan another trip soon?” Let her know you value her and that you’ll make it up to her. Apologize for the surprise, listen to her frustration, and set a concrete date for a joint adventure. That shows you care and respects both sides","

It's important to remember that setting boundaries is not only okay but necessary for your well-being. You're not obligated to play with your cousin if you're not comfortable or if you have other priorities. It's unfortunate that your aunt didn't support your boundaries and that the situation escalated.

In terms of responding physically, it's generally best to avoid retaliating, as it can exacerbate the situation and lead to further conflict. It's understandable that you reacted in the heat of the moment, but it's crucial to find ways to address these conflicts without resorting to physical actions. In the future, trying to communicate your boundaries calmly and seeking support from other family members might help prevent similar incidents.

Overall, it's clear you're trying to navigate a difficult family dynamic, and it's important to prioritize your own comfort and boundaries while also striving for peaceful resolutions when possible.","

Your response:
","Let me address this carefully, keeping in mind both your perspective and the complex family dynamics at play.

You're not wrong for setting boundaries about when you want to play with your cousin. At 19, you have the right to engage in adult conversations and shouldn't be forced to drop everything for a 6-year-old's demands. Your aunt's reaction was completely inappropriate - slapping you was assault, and her expectation that you're responsible for entertaining her child is unreasonable.

However, responding with physical violence (slapping back) likely escalated the situation unnecessarily, even though it was reactive. While understandable given the circumstances, it wasn't the best choice.

Moving forward, I'd suggest:
1. Maintaining firm but polite boundaries with your cousin
2. Documenting any future incidents of physical aggression from your aunt
3. Having a calm discussion with your parents about the situation
4. Keeping distance as needed for your wellbeing

You're not the asshole for saying no to playing, but the physical response could have been handled better. Your aunt's behavior is the primary issue here.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're caught in a very difficult and intense situation, especially given the dynamics within your family. On one hand, it seems like your aunt has created a culture of entitlement around her daughter, making it challenging for others to set boundaries. On the other hand, it's also understandable that you feel frustrated and tired of being expected to handle your cousin's tantrums.

In the context of the situation, it's not surprising that you said no to playing with your cousin and stood up for yourself when your aunt overstepped. However, slapping your aunt back may have escalated the situation further. It might be helpful to consider how you could have maintained your boundaries in a way that didn't lead to more conflict.

That being said, it's essential to acknowledge that you were physically assaulted by your cousin and then by your aunt, which can be very distressing. It's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and safety in these situations.","

Your response:
","It’s understandable you felt upset when a child’s tantrum turned physical and the aunt reacted the way she did. You were not the one who physically hit anyone, and you did set a boundary when you were busy with family. In most cases, a child’s aggressive outburst is a sign of frustration, not a personal attack. The aunt’s immediate response—blaming you for “not playing” and then slapping you—seems disproportionate, especially since she’s the parent. Slapping her back only escalated the situation and put you in a defensive position. For future gatherings, it’s best to calmly explain that you’re busy, give the child an alternative activity, and involve the parent if the child becomes aggressive. If the aunt’s behavior feels threatening, it might help to talk privately with a family member you trust about setting respectful boundaries. In short, you were not the asshole; the escalation from both sides was unfortunate but not a reflection of your character.","

xt07kk,AITAH,AITA for asking my partner to contribute her inherited investment income to our joint funds?,tressindar,"5 years ago my partner inherited $500k and two properties, one of which we live in, the other which is a rental.  She makes about $50k/year in returns from investing the money she inherited.  I earn about 30k/year working as an automotive mechanic and have no inherited wealth.  


Since we moved into her house she has not worked but I continue to do so.  In discussing the cost of our bills, I agreed to put 25% of my income into a joint account for paying our meager bills.  I requested she put 25% of her investment income into that same account and she got very angry with me and said that she will never share any of her inheritance with me and that her annual percentage yields don't count as income.  


Am I the asshole for asking her to contribute those investment yields to our joint account?

Maybe IATA for thinking her inheritance money investment returns should be considered income and should be used for family expenses?",56,100,1664643038,"You pay all the monthly bills like utilities, insurance and groceries, but the house is hers so she considers that her contribution to the household.  Am I missing something? I guess it would depend on how much the house is worth. Not enough info to say who the AH is. Plus you say ""meager bills"" so why do you need so much in the joint?",49,Unite-y,"Eesh 

This is tricky because there are too many assumptions that have to be made, here are mine.

#1 this joint account should is used only for bills/household things agreed upon like food anything leftover stays in this account. If your ""meager"" bills are paid in full and on time and you aren't struggling to handle them with only your 25% contribution then this account should either trend to a normal balance ie be at least a 100 because your cash flow in and out is even or it should have savings. The things going in and out should be traceable as household bills or agreed upon shared expenses like food. 

#2 She pays for unseen housing expenses in their entirety, your contribution does not go towards these at all. I am assuming she pays property taxes, house insurance, other insurance maybe, possibly a warranty, repairs, replacements, maintenence, furnishings, etc and that your contribution doesnt cover those things. If the things that she pays for towards the house on a yearly basis exceed or meet what you spend and the bills you contribute to are paid on time and in full without her taking the leftovers YTA. Those yearly bills alone can easily total over the 7500 pretax amount that is your 25%. If she flat out pays the same or more on these things yta

If her yearly costs are less than your yearly contribution you are NTA. For everybody saying that she pays your rent, if you bought a house today, in 15-30 years when you don't have the mortgage which one of you gets to stop contributing to everything else? 🤔  oh wait, you are still a team, partners if you will, and you are working together to conquer the battle that exists just to live somewhere. If one of you stopped you would be a free loader or maybe just a roommate, not a partner. That would pretty much make you a landlord. You pay for household expenses while I reap the benefits of not having to assist in our shared expenses. 

To those saying its not income, if you live off interest on investments it doesnt matter if its technically income or not based off tax standards, thats irrelevant. Just because it's not taxable does not mean it isn't equal dollar to dollar to what a person working for it is. It's the salary you paid yourself just without trading nearly the percentage of time that a job takes.

All in all it could go either way, but I think that your bigger issue is that you currently feel undervalued for what you contribute. Likely because you have to work and she doesn't. How you have described this situation very much makes it feel like it isn't a partnership with thorough communication. It also does seem like she is either very frightened of losing her investments because she is careful with them (feels like a long shot) or she doesn't see you as a partner worth investing with. 

This isn't giving us its giving mine and hers. 

If you were really partners in life and in it together for the long haul an approach where the entirety of the household expenses was added up and split according would likely be a better way to go. Mortgage or rent (or the lack thereof) utilities, taxes, insurance/s, food, repairs, maintenence, furnishings, all of it. If it's part of you living there toss it in. Then split accordingly. If you can't even have that discussion to break it down so you can have a total understanding and agreement you have a lot bigger fish to fry.",6,ordinarygremlin,"It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, trying to balance fairness and financial responsibilities within your relationship. It's understandable to feel that both partners should contribute to shared expenses, but it's also important to recognize the emotional connection your partner might have with her inheritance. Inheritance can often be seen as a personal asset, and she might feel protective over it. 

Your request for her to contribute from her investment returns seems rooted in a desire for equity, especially since you're contributing a significant portion of your income. However, it might be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation about how you both view finances and mutual responsibilities. Try to approach the topic with empathy and understanding, and see if there's a compromise that acknowledges both of your perspectives. Open communication about financial goals and expectations can help you both find a path forward that feels fair and respectful for both parties.","

Your response:
","I hear how this situation is causing tension and frustration. It seems like you're trying to create what feels like a fair arrangement, while your partner views her inheritance and its returns as separate from shared household finances. This touches on some complex emotions around money, partnership, and equity.

The fact that you're questioning whether you might be wrong shows self-awareness. You're not an asshole for wanting to have an open discussion about shared finances with your partner. However, inheritance can be very personal and emotionally charged, often tied to family relationships and loss.

Rather than focusing on whether the investment returns ""count"" as income, perhaps explore having a deeper conversation with your partner about your shared vision for your financial future together. What does financial partnership mean to each of you? What are your individual and mutual goals? Consider working with a financial counselor who can help facilitate these discussions in a neutral way.

Remember, there's no universal ""right"" way for couples to handle money - it's about finding an arrangement that works for both partners while respecting each other's boundaries and feelings.","

","It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated and confused about how to approach this situation with your partner. On one hand, you feel like you're contributing a fair share of your income, and it seems reasonable to expect her to contribute a similar proportion of her investment income. On the other hand, she's very adamant that her inheritance is off-limits.

I hear that you're not asking her to give you control over the entire inheritance, but rather to contribute a portion of the returns to your joint expenses. It's understandable that you'd feel like this is a fair request, especially since you're shouldering a significant portion of the bills.

However, it's also important to consider your partner's perspective and feelings about her inheritance. It's possible that she sees it as a safety net or a connection to her past, and is hesitant to share it with you. It might be helpful to have a calm and non-confrontational conversation with her about your feelings and concerns, and to try to understand where she's coming from.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between two legitimate concerns: you’re working hard to keep a roof over your heads, and she’s suddenly being asked to “share” money that has no real source for her to pay out of. In many couples, joint expenses are split by income, so asking for a 25 % share of *every* income stream feels fair from your perspective. But inheritance, even when it’s turned into investment income, is still her property until she legally transfers it. She may feel that a lump‑sum gift that she can’t touch is different from wages she earned.  

Your frustration is understandable—if you’re the only one paying bills, you want a proportional contribution. Her reaction, however, feels defensive: she’s likely worried about losing control of a large asset she didn’t earn. Not a good place to argue over ethics; it’s about boundaries.  

Try a calm conversation that separates “money” from “ownership.” Ask how she would like to handle shared costs if she were to transfer a portion of her investment portfolio to a joint account (or simply contribute a fixed amount). Offer to set up a","

Your response:
","I hear how much this situation is hurting you, especially feeling ignored when your mom is with other children. Those feelings are valid. While the comment about menopause wasn't kind, it seems to come from a deeper place of fear about losing your connection with your mom.

It's natural to have complex feelings about potential siblings, especially as a teenager dealing with mental health challenges. You're not selfish for having these feelings or for being honest about them. However, the way we express our feelings can sometimes hurt others, even when that's not our intention.

Perhaps you could try talking to your mom when things calm down. You might say something like: ""Mom, I'm sorry about the menopause comment. I was hurt and scared because when you're with other kids, I feel invisible. I worry about losing our special relationship.""

Remember, your parents' family planning decisions are ultimately theirs to make, but your feelings matter too. Would you be open to discussing these fears with your therapist or counselor?","

It’s not like I don’t want one, it’s just I’ve seen my mom around my baby cousins and while she’s with them she ignores me and I hate it.

Here’s the part where I may be the asshole, today we had a long car drive and we were talking about my sister(23f) being pregnant. And my mom said “wouldn’t it be fun for us to be pregnant at the same time?”. I said no, she asked why and I told her because I didn’t want another child. Then i made a joke about how she was too old and about to go through menopause. She got super angry and called me selfish. We got to the hotel and she hasn’t talked to me since and refuses to even serve me dinner. So am I the asshole? Or rather am I selfish?.

Your response:
","You sound like you're feeling a mix of emotions - not wanting a sibling, feeling left out when your mom is with your baby cousins, and now dealing with the tension with your mom. It's understandable that you expressed your feelings, even if it came out in a way that hurt your mom. The joke about menopause might have been a way to deflect or lighten the mood, but it clearly didn't work.

It's not about being selfish or not. You have valid concerns about how having another child might affect your relationship with your mom, and it's okay to express those feelings. However, it's also important to consider how your words affected your mom. It might be helpful to talk to her about why you feel the way you do, and to listen to her perspective as well. Communication can help clear the air and work through this challenge.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: AITA for telling my parents I don’t want a sibling?  Ok so I(13f) am an only child of my mom(41f) and dad (47m). I’m going to note that I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, and BED. I have not always been the best daughter because of my illnesses but I try to be. Im not medication and doing well at the moment.

Your response:
","I hear how hurtful it feels when your parents keep bringing up a new sibling, especially after you’ve made it clear you want to stay an only child. You’re not “selfish” for wanting to be the focus of your parents’ attention and for protecting your own mental‑health space. It sounds like your mom’s question and your response slipped into a moment of frustration—especially after you jokingly mentioned menopause, which can feel like a personal jab. That’s probably why she’s shut down.  

Try to set a calm, private time to talk with her: explain how the idea of another baby makes you anxious and that you need to feel seen and heard now. Acknowledge her excitement, but ask for respectful boundaries. If she continues to ignore you, consider setting a short “cool‑down” period before you reconnect. You’re not an asshole; you’re protecting yourself and asking for mutual respect.","

zyt4dx,AITAH,WIBTA if I tell my sister that I cannot continue to watch her kids for my mental health?,No_Poet7069,"I (24F) have been watching my (28F) sister's kids since they were born. Her kids are now 5 &amp; 7 years old, and over this past year, their behavior has gotten pretty awful. My sister is a single mother and her baby daddy (33M) is not in the picture. He has a family history of mental illness, ADHD, and Autism. 

My nieces have both been suspended from school on multiple occasions for being violent, aggressive, and destroying property.

I have never required her to pay me, but have asked for cash here and there to help pay for gas (I live 25 miles away). When my nieces were getting suspended from school, I was the one that ended up having to drop my plans to watch them. As everyone else in the family is busy and cannot help with childcare, I have unknowingly become the sole childcare provider.

My sister lit into me last night because I did not spank the girls for misbehaving. I do not feel comfortable with giving the kids physical punishments like spankings, as I am not their parent. I have explained this to my sister many times, but she still thinks that it is stupid of me not to do it, and has not respected that boundary. I stretched WAY too thin with my stuff and I cannot continue to sacrifice my plans and future for her and her kids. I love my family and I am trying the best that I can to work with her, but my sister always has something to critique about me and it genuinely feels like I can never do anything right when it comes to her and her kids. 

I am to the point where I need to make a choice. I spoke with my mother about this at length, and she is trying to remain a neutral party in it but says I need to grow up and stand up for myself because she is sick of both my sister and I not being able to get along. I have been thinking of having this conversation for a while, but have not done it yet due to my anxiety. I feel that, for my health and well-being, I need to step away and focus on ME.

It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, and setting boundaries with your sister is a necessary step, even if it's challenging. You are not the villain for needing to focus on yourself; in fact, being honest with her about your limitations is both healthy and mature. Your sister's situation is difficult, but you cannot sacrifice your mental and physical health indefinitely.

Consider approaching the conversation from a place of care and understanding. Let her know that while you love her and her children, you need to prioritize your own health and future. It might also be worth suggesting alternative solutions, such as looking for other childcare options or resources that could support her. Remember, setting boundaries is not only about saying ""no,"" but also about creating a healthier dynamic for both parties. You deserve to focus on your own needs and well-being without guilt.","

Your response:
","Based on the expert dialog example, I'll respond with empathy while validating the person's feelings:

""I can hear how much you care about your sister and nieces, while also feeling completely overwhelmed and unappreciated. It's clear you've gone above and beyond - even losing your job trying to help - yet your boundaries aren't being respected. The fact that you're worried about this decision, despite everything you've sacrificed, shows what a caring person you are.

Your mother is right - taking care of your own mental health isn't selfish, it's necessary. You can love your family while still setting healthy boundaries. The guilt you're feeling is understandable, but remember that you can't effectively help others if you're stretched too thin yourself.

You wouldn't be the asshole for prioritizing your wellbeing. In fact, being honest about your limits might ultimately be better for everyone involved, including your sister and nieces, as it could push your sister to seek more sustainable childcare solutions.""","

","It sounds like you're in a really tough and draining situation.

It's great that you're recognizing your limits and prioritizing your mental health. 

It's understandable that you're worried about your sister's reaction, but it's essential to remember that you can't control how she responds. What you can control is being honest and clear about your boundaries and needs. It might be helpful to approach the conversation with empathy and explain how this decision is not about abandoning her or the kids, but about taking care of yourself so you can be a better support system in the long run.

It's also great that you have a support system, like your mom, who is encouraging you to stand up for yourself. Remember that you deserve to prioritize your own needs and take care of yourself.","

Your response:
","It’s clear you’re carrying a heavy load, and the pressure is rightfully hurting you. You’ve been the family’s anchor for years, but you’re not a superhero—your own health matters. A respectful, honest conversation can feel scary, but framing it around *your needs* rather than “what I’m doing wrong” can soften the blow. Try a “I” statement: “I’ve realized I’m out of breath caring for the kids and I need to protect my mental and physical health. I can’t keep doing this.” Offer concrete alternatives: a local babysitter, a childcare swap, or a family‑based schedule that shares the load. If your sister reacts with guilt, stay firm but keep the door open—“I’m not cutting ties, just setting a boundary.” Remember, setting limits is an act of love for yourself and, ultimately, for the children. You deserve a break.","

wl6p4e,AITAH,AITH for breaking up w/ my bf 2 days after vacation?,cander73,"Sorry this is so long… 
Backstory, my boyfriend (50m) and I (45f) have been together a little over 1.5 years. Last Christmas my sister presented our family w/ a family vacation to be taken in August. My sister was paying for the airfare and Airbnb for everyone, 11 people in our family and extended the invite to my bf and his daughter. 
My bf accepted this gift. He has been out of work since May and hasn’t even really tried looking for a job. I picked up an additional job as well as additional shifts over the last 7 months to have extra money to pay for me and my sons food and activities while on vacation. During this time I told my bf that we should not expect or even allow my sister to pay for anything else while on the vacation and to make sure he had money for him and his daughter. He said he did from his savings/investment account. 
Fast forward, we arrive at the airport and he and his daughter check in without waiting for our whole group. He gambles on the slots at the airport bar and wins $100. He doesnt buy a round of drinks but instead accepts 2 rounds of drinks my sister bought. We take our flight and arrive at our destination where my sister had food delivered for all of us. The adults in the group then decide to walk to a local bar and he immediately orders himself a drink and pays for it and finds a slot machine to gamble on. He loses on the slots. He comes back and again accepts drinks that others including myself and my sister bought. 
This type of thing continues throughout the whole week vacation with groceries for the house, drinks and dinners out. In addition my sister made reservations for the group at his request to go to a museum for the entire group and he never even offers to pay for himself and his daughter (tix were $30-$40 a piece).

It's understandable to feel this way given the circumstances you described. It seems like you were hoping for a more balanced sharing of expenses, and his actions didn't meet those expectations.

Regarding your question about asking him to reimburse your sister, it might be worth having a candid conversation with him about how his actions affected you and your family. He may not realize the extent of his behavior's impact, or he might have a different perspective on what happened. This discussion could help you decide whether asking for reimbursement is appropriate.

As for the relationship, it's important to consider if his actions align with your values and expectations. If you feel that his behavior reflects a pattern that you can't accept, it might be time to reassess the relationship. When it comes to breaking up, honesty is usually the best policy. You can express your feelings and reasons for ending things without being confrontational, focusing on what you need for your well-being.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: AITH for breaking up w/ my bf 2 days after vacation?  Sorry this is so long… 
Backstory, my boyfriend (50m) and I (45f) have been together a little over 1.5 years. Last Christmas my sister presented our family w/ a family vacation to be taken in August. My sister was paying for the airfare and Airbnb for everyone, 11 people in our family and extended the invite to my bf and his daughter. 
My bf accepted this gift. He has been out of work since May and hasn’t even really tried looking for a job. I picked up an additional job as well as additional shifts over the last 7 months to have extra money to pay for me and my sons food and activities while on vacation. During this time I told my bf that we should not expect or even allow my sister to pay for anything else while on the vacation and to make sure he had money for him and his daughter. He said he did from his savings/investment account. 
Fast forward, we arrive at the airport and he and his daughter check in without waiting for our whole group. He gambles on the slots at the airport bar and wins $100. He doesnt buy a round of drinks but instead accepts 2 rounds of drinks my sister bought. We take our flight and arrive at our destination where my sister had food delivered for all of us. The adults in the group then decide to walk to a local bar and he immediately orders himself a drink and pays for it and finds a slot machine to gamble on. He loses on the slots. He comes back and again accepts drinks that others including myself and my sister bought. 
This type of thing continues throughout the whole week vacation with groceries for the house, drinks and dinners out. In addition my sister made reservations for the group at his request to go to a museum for the entire group and he never even offers to pay for himself and his daughter (tix were $30-$40 a piece).

Your response:
","Based on the dialog example, I'll respond with empathy while addressing the core issues:

""I can hear how hurt and disappointed you are by your boyfriend's behavior during this generous family vacation. It seems like there are several layers to your concern - the financial aspect, his apparent lack of gratitude, and what his actions might reveal about his values and character.

The fact that you're asking these questions suggests you've already recognized some fundamental misalignments between your values and his. You worked extra jobs to prepare for this vacation while he seemed comfortable letting others cover expenses, even though he had means to contribute (as evidenced by the Disney trip).

Before making a final decision, you might want to reflect on whether this behavior is part of a larger pattern that bothers you. If you choose to end the relationship, you're not wrong for doing so - it's valid to want a partner who shares your values about financial responsibility and showing appreciation. Whether you explain your reasons or simply walk away depends on what would give you the most peace moving forward.""","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling taken advantage of and disrespected by your boyfriend's behavior on the family vacation. His actions, or lack thereof, seem to be a recurring pattern of not contributing financially or showing gratitude towards your family. It's understandable that you're considering breaking up with him. 

Before making any decisions, take a moment to reflect on why you're feeling this way. Is it solely because of his behavior on the vacation, or are there deeper issues in your relationship that have been bothering you? 

As for asking him for money to pay your sister back, it's a fair request, but consider whether it's a convenient way to avoid confronting the real issues in your relationship. If you decide to break up with him, it might be more productive to have an honest conversation about how his behavior affected you, rather than just walking away. This could help you both gain closure and clarity. However, prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider whether having this conversation will be therapeutic for you or potentially toxic.","

Your response:
","It sounds like the vacation was a turning point that made a lot of underlying frustrations so visible. You’ve invested time, money, and energy trying to keep the trip going, and his repeated refusal to share the cost or show gratitude feels like a pattern of self‑interest that you can’t ignore.  

You don’t owe him money for the museum or parasailing—those were gifts from your sister, not his responsibility. If you feel the need to keep the relationship afloat, you could calmly explain how his actions hurt you and set a clear boundary: “I don’t want to feel like I’m paying for your choices. If we’re going to continue, we need to share expenses and show appreciation.”  

If he’s not willing to change, it may be healthier to walk away. You can do so without a long, self‑critical monologue—just say, “I’m ending this because","

ymj850,AITAH,AITA for telling off a Karen?,DragonTamer226,"Okay, so... I might have gone too far with this one. Here's the story; I had my sons, 1 and 3 years old at the park. I had my 1 year old in a swing while my toddler played close by. My toddler has a toy firetruck he calls ""wee-woo"", and we always bring it to the park.
Usually, everyone is cool with this because he prefers to play by himself or with me. (Covid really messed up his social skills, he doesn't really know how to react with other toddlers yet). So, anyway, 3 year old is playing with wee-woo, happy as can be. Suddenly this fucking Karen storms over from the nearby picnic tables and TAKES MY SONS TOY! Instantly, there was tears and crying, and before I could even say one fucking thing, she tells him not to be a baby and walks away.
I am beyond livid by this point. I gather my children and put them in the car. Then I walked over to this lady and grabbed her purse. She FREAKED out, but I just walked away. I told her when she gives my sons toy back, she can have her purse. She threatened to call the cops, I told her go ahead. She can't just take someone else's property, even a toddlers. She told me her phone was in her ourse, I shrugged and said too bad. After freaking out for a couple minutes she handed over my sons truck. I told her if she wanted her purse back, to go apologize to my kid. She refused, called me all manner of names. So... I threw her purse in the garbage bin on my way out of the park.
I want it to be noted that at least three couples saw this whole interaction, and not one person said anything. Idk if they just didn't want to get involved, but nobody called me an asshole or told me to back off, but they also didn't say anything about her taking my sons toy. So... was I the asshole? Did I go too far? 

EDIT TO ADD: Yes, the truck does make noise. It's definitely not THAT loud, and tons of kids in the community bring toys that make noise to the parks. Everyone is usually whatever about this, unless it's like fireworks loud.

I just have to ask… is this a toy that has the sounds…horns sirens and shit? If so, that would drive me nuts. I mean, I wouldn’t take the toy from somebody else’s kid, but it would be really annoying. 

But the question was are u the a-hole.  NTA because you were just protecting your kid.

It's understandable to be upset when someone takes your child's toy, especially when it causes your son distress. However, while your actions were driven by a desire to right a wrong, they might have escalated the situation further than necessary. Taking the woman's purse and throwing it away could be seen as equally inappropriate, even if it was in response to her actions.

In such situations, it might be more effective to firmly and calmly address the person, assertively requesting the toy's return while explaining the impact on your child. If that doesn't work, involving park authorities or local law enforcement might be a better course of action. It's important to model behavior for your children that demonstrates how to handle conflicts constructively. While your feelings are valid, finding a resolution that doesn't escalate tensions further can be beneficial for everyone involved.","

Your response:
","Let me address this carefully. While the ""Karen's"" behavior was completely unacceptable - stealing from a child is never okay - your response crossed some serious legal lines. Taking someone's purse and disposing of it is theft and could result in criminal charges, regardless of the provocation.

I understand your protective instinct as a parent. Seeing your child upset and having their property stolen would make any parent angry. However, there were better ways to handle this:
- Firmly demanding the toy back
- Recording the incident
- Calling the police yourself to report the theft of your son's toy
- Speaking to other witnesses

By escalating to theft and property destruction, you've potentially put yourself in legal jeopardy and modeled problematic conflict resolution for your children. The other parents likely stayed quiet because both parties were acting inappropriately.

Next time, try to model the behavior you'd want your children to learn - stand up for yourself firmly but legally, and don't let someone else's bad behavior push you into making poor choices yourself.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for telling off a Karen?  Okay, so... I might have gone too far with this one. Here's the story; I had my sons, 1 and 3 years old at the park. I had my 1 year old in a swing while my toddler played close by. My toddler has a toy firetruck he calls ""wee-woo"", and we always bring it to the park.
Usually, everyone is cool with this because he prefers to play by himself or with me. (Covid really messed up his social skills, he doesn't really know how to react with other toddlers yet). So, anyway, 3 year old is playing with wee-woo, happy as can be. Suddenly this fucking Karen storms over from the nearby picnic tables and TAKES MY SONS TOY! Instantly, there was tears and crying, and before I could even say one fucking thing, she tells him not to be a baby and walks away.
I am beyond livid by this point. I gather my children and put them in the car. Then I walked over to this lady and grabbed her purse. She FREAKED out, but I just walked away. I told her when she gives my sons toy back, she can have her purse. She threatened to call the cops, I told her go ahead. She can't just take someone else's property, even a toddlers. She told me her phone was in her ourse, I shrugged and said too bad. After freaking out for a couple minutes she handed over my sons truck. I told her if she wanted her purse back, to go apologize to my kid. She refused, called me all manner of names. So... I threw her purse in the garbage bin on my way out of the park.
I want it to be noted that at least three couples saw this whole interaction, and not one person said anything. Idk if they just didn't want to get involved, but nobody called me an asshole or told me to back off, but they also didn't say anything about her taking my sons toy. So... was I the asshole? Did I go too far? 

EDIT TO ADD: Yes, the truck does make noise. It's definitely not THAT loud, and tons of kids in the community bring toys that make noise to the parks. Everyone is usually whatever about this, unless it's like fireworks loud. If the noise was the problem, the truck does have an on/off switch that I would have turned off IF SHE HAD ASKED..

Your response:
","It sounds like you were in a moment of intense protectiveness and that turned into a confrontation that spiraled quickly. You did feel that your son’s toy was taken unjustly, and you reacted in the heat of the moment—grabbing the purse and later discarding it. In a calm, reflective view, the escalation (purse‑grab, threat to police, throwing the purse into trash) was likely unnecessary and could be seen as disproportionate to the original misdeed. 

That said, you were also frustrated by a stranger’s over‑enthusiastic “Karen” behavior that left your children upset. The fact that onlookers stayed silent doesn’t automatically absolve the altercation; people often stay quiet to avoid conflict or because they’re uncertain about the situation. 

A constructive next step might be to call the park staff or a local authority to report the incident, ensuring the child’s toy is returned and that any potential policy about “no weapon‑like” toys is clarified. For future visits, a calm request or a quick note to the parent could prevent a similar escalation.","

xltndg,AITAH,AITAH for kicking my biological father out my life?,evaegg,"Yesterday I (27F) saw my biological father when I was coming back home from the bank. My mom and him got divorced when i was 4 because he was abusive and cheated on my mom. They had shared custody and my sister (5 years older) and I were visiting him every 2 weeks. When my sister got 13 she decided to leave my mom’s house and live with him, so my mom and I decided I was not visiting him anymore. One day (when I was 9) we meet casually while my step father and my mom were driving me home from a birthday party, he crashed his car into ours many times intentionally as a “revenge” for not visiting him. After that there was a trial and he end up winning, so I had to visit him again. Every time I had to visit him I felt sick and I was shiverin. He mistreated me and I was really scared of him. When I turned 13 I had the right to decide not visiting him anymore, so I did.
Meanwhile he “raised” my sister, she didn’t even finished high school and she “chose” the wrong path in life (basically bc he never was at home and she had no education at all). I went to university and did kung fu for 8 years, but he NEVER paid the maintenance. Since i was 20 everytime I saw him he was recriminanting me that I didn’t talk to him and I didn’t love him, making me feel guilty and a bad person. I used to answer with excuses because I didn’t know how to face that situation. 
Yesterday I couldn’t take it anymore. I got mad and I told him that he has what he deserves. He never was a father for me, he traumatized me (when I said this he laughed)and I reminded him all the bad things he did to me and my sister. He just answered that my mom poisoned my mind.

From what you've described, it seems that your decision to cut ties with him comes from a place of self-preservation and the need to protect yourself from further hurt. It's understandable to feel conflicted about such a significant decision, but it's important to prioritize your well-being. 

Your feelings are valid, especially considering the past trauma and the lack of acknowledgment or responsibility from his side. Setting boundaries with people who have caused you pain can be a necessary step toward healing. It’s natural to feel guilt or question your actions, but remember that you have the right to choose who is part of your life.

Your response:
","Based on your description, you are absolutely not in the wrong for cutting contact with your biological father. His pattern of abusive behavior, including intentionally crashing into your family's car, emotional manipulation, and dismissing your trauma by laughing at it, shows a concerning lack of responsibility and empathy. The fact that he blames your mother for ""poisoning your mind"" rather than acknowledging his actions is a classic pattern of abusive behavior.

Your decision to set this boundary seems like a healthy step toward protecting your mental and emotional wellbeing. You've given him multiple opportunities to be part of your life, but he has consistently shown that he's unwilling to take responsibility for his actions or respect your feelings. It's completely reasonable to distance yourself from someone who continues to harm you, even if they're family.

You've worked hard to build a good life for yourself despite his lack of support, and you don't owe him a relationship just because he's your biological father. Sometimes the healthiest choice is to step away from toxic relationships.","

Your response:
","It takes a lot of courage to stand up for yourself and set boundaries, especially with someone who has caused you so much pain and trauma. It sounds like your biological father's behavior has had a profound impact on your life, and it's understandable that you wouldn't want to continue engaging with him. His inability to take responsibility for his actions and his attempt to shift the blame to your mother is a clear indicator that he's not willing to acknowledge the harm he's caused. By telling him you're not talking to him anymore, you're taking control of your own healing and well-being. That's not an easy thing to do, but it's a necessary step in protecting yourself from further hurt.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a huge, unresolved wound—one that’s been layered on for years. The pain you felt when you had to visit him, the guilt he pressed on you, and the sense that you “didn’t love him” or “talk to him” are all echoes of the abuse you experienced. It’s understandable that you’d be furious and want to cut ties after being forced to confront a part of your childhood that left you scarred. 

You’ve made a decision that feels right for you: protecting yourself from a toxic dynamic. It’s not “kicking” him out so much as setting a boundary that preserves your mental and emotional health. If you ever feel pressured to revisit that relationship, remember that your safety and peace are paramount. You deserve respect, not guilt or blame.","

zy1m6p,AITAH,Aita for not letting my son see his paternal side of the family,Green_Bug6839,"I 24 f and my so 21 m had a baby in august of 2021. I had a miserable pregnancy (not because of anything in specific, I just hated being pregnant) and after I had my son I had a bunch of medical problems with my heart and fluid in my lungs that caused me to be in the hospital for a week after having my son. I felt really guilty about it since I was away from him.  As a result of said problem I had to wear a portable defibrillator and had to be careful who I was around. (Around the time of Covid) about a month later my fil had gotten sick too and was in the hospital for about a month and a half with Covid and pneumonia. After I got out I made sure to tell people do not kiss my child, get in his face or suck his binky clean and to let us know when anyone was sick so my condition ( which is lifelong) wouldn’t be worsened or jeopardized andi didn’t have to deal with a newborn with Covid. We got no warning of anyone being sick until we got to their house but when he got sick they asked us to be considerate and not come around until we were clear. Move on to the times we would go over, I would catch my so’s sister kissing my son after I asked them not to. So we kept reminding them. Then my so’s birthday came shortly after I gave birth. I told his siblings if anyone wanted to hold him to ask me first. My son was asleep in my arms and his sister offered to put him in his bouncer to sleep. I said sure just to make sure to ask me if anyone wants to hold him. I walk in to someone I had only met once before holding my child and I stopped in my tracks and stared and she put him down. Later on his mom was holding him and let someone I didn’t know hold him and kiss him. I was livid. So I kept him close the rest of the night. Fast forward to a few months later ( somethings might have happened in between too much to type) and his little brother is holding him but his sister wanted him and he said no so she punch the brother with my son in his arms still. A week later the same thing happens and I say something and yell at them. All during this time she’s sneaking kisses after I’ve asked not to. One night we decide to go out for a date night and ask his mom to watch the baby. The whole time we’re out she’s texting asking when we’re going to be back to get him and when we get back she’s asleep and the 15 year old sister is watching him. (I don’t trust her to know what to do in an emergency so i would rather have an adult always watching him) Again livid. Then a few months later we ask his mom to watch him again. We get back and his sister tells us that she gave our 6/7 month old baby a sour patch kid and that she’s been watching him for the last hour. I’m over his family at this point. Fast forward to his first birthday party, me and his dad were having a rough time. I forced him to move in with his mom for a while and my son would go over on weekends. In between him living with his mom he would come over during weekdays sometimes to have dinner with us and his mom would make snarky comments like oh careful she might put poison in your food but he says it was a joke. His birthday party came and they made my family and I feel soo unwelcome. I got there to decorate and they didn’t help with anything. ( It was at their house) setting up chairs, tables, decorations, food etc. I don’t get a hi upon my arrival, don’t get help decorating, and when my family started to arrive it only got worse. My so and I set up everything outside while they stayed inside glaring at my family from the back door. Every five minutes someone was in the door. His mom invited people i barely knew and I didn’t invite, and when all her guests that she invited arrived they stayed inside the house the ENTIRE TIME. They even set up tables and chairs inside but couldn’t help us do it outside. It started to rain and none of his family said we could come inside, so we’re all huddled on this small porch while winds and rain were blowing everywhere. Their first thought was to bring the food in. So we sang happy birthday and opened presents and all of my family left. About an hour later they asked if we were going to sing happy birthday and my sons father told his mom and sister we already did. I guess they were shocked and asked “you really did it already without us”. Yes we did. You have not participated at all. This was my last straw. I told my sons father he would no be going over there until they learned to respect me as his mother. (We are back together now so he lives with me) he agreed but I feel a little guilty about it soo Aita?",48,90,1672307813,"NTA

You should have cut them of after they left your child unattended with their child. Anything can happen in a few minutes and they left him for hours. Then again. A child gave your baby a sour patch sweet which he could have choked on or had an allergic reaction to. 

They have proven time and time against they cannot be trusted. Stop giving them chances. WHY is your SO not putting a stop to his families behaviour?!? 

The safety and well-being of your child should be the priority. You are your child’s advocates until he is older.",51,a-_rose,"The one that she’s not on anymore? Also, she’s talking about events in summer when Covid and other things aren’t really going around like they are in winter.",-2,LapulusHogulus,"It sounds like you're in a really tough situation, trying to balance your child's safety and well-being with family dynamics that feel disrespectful and dismissive of your boundaries. It's understandable that you would feel conflicted about keeping your son away from his paternal side of the family, especially when your requests for his safety were not respected. Your primary responsibility is to your child's health and safety, and it seems you've made decisions based on that priority.

It’s also clear that you’ve tried to communicate your concerns and needs, but those have not been honored. Feeling unwelcome and unsupported at family gatherings can be incredibly isolating, and it’s reasonable to set boundaries to protect yourself and your child. It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your partner about how to move forward in a way that feels safe and respectful for everyone involved. Remember, you’re not alone in navigating these challenges, and seeking support from friends or a counselor might also provide additional perspectives and reassurance.","

Move on to the times we would go over, I would catch my so’s sister kissing my son after I asked them not to. So we kept reminding them. Then my so’s birthday came shortly after I gave birth. I told his siblings if anyone wanted to hold him to ask me first. My son was asleep in my arms and his sister offered to put him in his bouncer to sleep. I said sure just to make sure to ask me if anyone wants to hold him. I walk in to someone I had only met once before holding my child and I stopped in my tracks and stared and she put him down. Later on his mom was holding him and let someone I didn’t know hold him and kiss him. I was livid. So I kept him close the rest of the night. Fast forward to a few months later ( somethings might have happened in between too much to type) and his little brother is holding him but his sister wanted him and he said no so she punch the brother with my son in his arms still. A week later the same thing happens and I say something and yell at them. All during this time she’s sneaking kisses after I’ve asked not to. One night we decide to go out for a date night and ask his mom to watch the baby. The whole time we’re out she’s texting asking when we’re going to be back to get him and when we get back she’s asleep and the 15 year old sister is watching him. (I don’t trust her to know what to do in an emergency so i would rather have an adult always watching him) Again livid. Then a few months later we ask his mom to watch him again. We get back and his sister tells us that she gave our 6/7 month old baby a sour patch kid and that she’s been watching him for the last hour. I’m over his family at this point. Fast forward to his first birthday party, me and his dad were having a rough time. I forced him to move in with his mom for a while and my son would go over on weekends. In between him living with his mom he would come over during weekdays sometimes to have dinner with us and his mom would make snarky comments like oh careful she might put poison in your food but he says it was a joke. His birthday party came and they made my family and I feel soo unwelcome. I got there to decorate and they didn’t help with anything. ( It was at their house) setting up chairs, tables, decorations, food etc. I don’t get a hi upon my arrival, don’t get help decorating, and when my family started to arrive it only got worse. My so and I set up everything outside while they stayed inside glaring at my family from the back door. Every five minutes someone was in the door. His mom invited people i barely knew and I didn’t invite, and when all her guests that she invited arrived they stayed inside the house the ENTIRE TIME. They even set up tables and chairs inside but couldn’t help us do it outside. It started to rain and none of his family said we could come inside, so we’re all huddled on this small porch while winds and rain were blowing everywhere. Their first thought was to bring the food in. So we sang happy birthday and opened presents and all of my family left. About an hour later they asked if we were going to sing happy birthday and my sons father told his mom and sister we already did. I guess they were shocked and asked “you really did it already without us”. Yes we did. You have not participated at all. This was my last straw. I told my sons father he would no be going over there until they learned to respect me as his mother. (We are back together now so he lives with me) he agreed but I feel a little guilty about it soo Aita?.

Your response:
","I understand your concerns about your child's safety and your frustration with feeling disrespected as a mother. From what you've described, you set reasonable boundaries regarding your child's health and safety (especially given your medical condition), but these boundaries were repeatedly ignored. The incidents with unauthorized people holding and kissing your baby, the sour patch candy incident with a young infant, and leaving your child with a minor without informing you are legitimate safety concerns.

The birthday party situation seems to highlight deeper family dynamics issues and a lack of respect for you and your family. While it's important for children to have relationships with extended family when possible, this needs to happen in a way that respects parental boundaries and ensures the child's safety.

You're not wrong to limit contact until proper boundaries can be established. However, I'd encourage you and your partner to have an open discussion about how to move forward - perhaps with clear, written guidelines for interaction and a gradual rebuilding of trust. This isn't about punishment, but about creating a safe, respectful environment for your child.","

Q: Aita for not letting my son see his paternal side of the family  I 24 f and my so 21 m had a baby in august of 2021. I had a miserable pregnancy (not because of anything in specific, I just hated being pregnant) and after I had my son I had a bunch of medical problems with my heart and fluid in my lungs that caused me to be in the hospital for a week after having my son. I felt really guilty about it since I was away from him.  As a result of said problem I had to wear a portable defibrillator and had to be careful who I was around. (Around the time of Covid) about a month later my fil had gotten sick too and was in the hospital for about a month and a half with Covid and pneumonia. After I got out I made sure to tell people do not kiss my child, get in his face or suck his binky clean and to let us know when anyone was sick so my condition ( which is lifelong) wouldn’t be worsened or jeopardized andi didn’t have to deal with a newborn with Covid.

Your response:
","It sounds like you went through a very challenging and stressful experience with your son's paternal family, especially during a time when you were still recovering from health issues and trying to protect your newborn from illness. The repeated disregard for your boundaries and requests for his safety, combined with the lack of effort to make you and your family feel welcome at his birthday party, must have felt incredibly frustrating and hurtful.

Your decision to limit your son's interaction with his paternal family until they learn to respect you as his mother seems like a reasonable response to the situation. It's understandable that you would want to prioritize your child's well-being and your own emotional safety. Rather than feeling guilty, it might be helpful to focus on the fact that you're taking steps to protect yourself and your child from a toxic and stressful environment.","

Your response:
","I hear you’re feeling hurt, angry, and exhausted. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of worry about your son’s safety—especially after your heart issues and the pandemic—and that your boundaries have been repeatedly ignored. When family members ignore those limits, it can feel like a betrayal of trust and a sign that they don’t respect you as his mother.

Given that the repeated breaches (kissing, food, unsupervised care, no help at the party) were not just small oversights but a pattern, many would say you’re justified in setting stricter boundaries. That said, labeling it “AITA” isn’t the point; it’s about protecting your child and honoring your own limits. If you’re comfortable, consider a calm family conversation or a neutral mediator to clarify expectations. If the pattern continues, limiting visits or arranging supervised playdates might be the safest route. You’re not alone, and you deserve respect and safety for your son.","

It's possible that the Super Mario contact photo seemed like a lighthearted or fun choice to you, but it might have had a different impact on her. Relationships often require understanding and considering each other's feelings, even in seemingly small things like contact photos.

You might want to start by reflecting on why you chose that image and whether it might have unintentionally upset her. Then, try reaching out to her with an apology that acknowledges her feelings, explaining that it wasn't your intention to upset her. Open communication can often help clear up misunderstandings and show that you care about how she feels. It might also be helpful to ask her how she'd like to be represented in your contacts, which can be a small but meaningful way to respect her preferences.","

Your response:
","I sense there's more to this situation than just the Mario photo. Your girlfriend's intense reaction suggests this might have touched on deeper feelings or insecurities. When you say ""I dunno"" in response to her asking why, it could come across as dismissive of her feelings, even if that wasn't your intent.

While having Mario as a contact photo might seem harmless to you, it's worth considering what it means to her. Does she feel like you're not taking her seriously? Or perhaps she's worried about how you view her? Instead of defending the photo or dismissing her concerns, you might want to have an honest conversation about why it upset her so much.

Try reaching out with something like: ""I can see now that the photo really upset you, and I want to understand why. I care about your feelings and I'm sorry for not taking your concern seriously at first.""

Remember, in relationships, it's not always about who's right or wrong, but about understanding and respecting each other's feelings.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a tough spot—you probably meant it as a light‑hearted joke, but it landed as a hurtful prank to her. The fact that she reacted strongly suggests she felt disrespected or singled out, even if that wasn’t your intention. A quick apology that acknowledges how it made her feel, followed by a calm explanation of why you thought it’d be funny, could help reset the conversation. Ask her what she’d like you to do with the contact photo right now, and check if there’s a deeper issue (like feeling insecure about the relationship) that’s fueling her reaction. A sincere, non‑defensive conversation often turns a “got‑cha” moment into a chance for deeper understanding.","

When I replied with “I dunno” she stormed off and she hasn’t been responding to my calls/texts. AITA?.

wajdy1,AITAH,AITA for answering my boyfriend’s phone?,BlackCatoftheEast,"My bf (33M) and I (29F) have been together for almost 7yrs now. He sleeps at my place every night, but he goes back to his place during the day and he doesn’t keep any of his stuff at mine. Last night he was out with his friends and when he came to my place he was flat out drunk and immediately went to sleep. I am working nights so I’m awake at that time. Around 4 in the morning, his phone started to ring, I usually ignore it when he gets a call while sleeping, but this one kept calling so I answered it. The call was through fb messenger, and the person’s profile name is Nom, so I guessed that wasn’t their real name. A girl answered and she was calling my boyfriend’s name. I asked her who she was, and she told me she’s my bf’s boss. Now my bf works freelance so I know for a fact he doesn’t have a boss. I asked her what her name was, and she told me to just ask my bf about it. I told her my bf is sleeping and asked her what her name is again. That’s when she told me she’ll sl—ap my mouth and sh*ot me. I called her rude and hung up on her. She kept calling after that so I put my bf’s phone on silent. Today, my bf found out what happened, and he got mad at me for answering his phone. He told me the girl is someone he does odd jobs for, like driving her around or something. He accused me of sabotaging one source of income for him, since apparently the girl pays way too much than the usual and it’s easy money for him. I told him the girl was rude to me, and he told me I wouldn’t have gotten that treatment from her had I not answered his phone, and that I don’t even know her enough to call her rude.

You were trying to handle a situation where your boyfriend was unreachable, and the call seemed persistent enough to warrant concern. It’s understandable that you felt compelled to answer, especially with the unusual circumstances of the call coming through Facebook Messenger and the insistence of the caller. 

Your boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about the potential impact on his work relationship rather than understanding your perspective. It might help to have a calm conversation with him about why you felt it was necessary to answer, emphasizing your intention to ensure everything was okay.

Additionally, the caller's threatening response is concerning and something that should be addressed. It's important to consider why someone he works with would react so aggressively. This situation raises questions about trust and communication in your relationship. It might be beneficial to discuss boundaries and expectations regarding privacy and communication with your boyfriend to prevent similar issues in the future.","

Your response:
","Based on the concerning situation you've described, you're not in the wrong for answering the phone after multiple calls at 4 AM, as this could have been an emergency. However, there are several red flags in this situation that deserve attention:

1. Your boyfriend's angry reaction seems disproportionate to the situation
2. The caller's threatening behavior is extremely concerning
3. The explanation about ""odd jobs"" and ""easy money"" is vague and suspicious
4. Your boyfriend defending someone who threatened you is troubling

While respecting privacy in relationships is important, threatening violence over a phone call is never acceptable. Your boyfriend's dismissal of these threats and blame-shifting onto you suggests he may be hiding something significant. Rather than focusing on whether you should have answered the phone, I'd encourage you to reflect on the larger pattern of behavior and what it reveals about your relationship's health and safety.

Consider having an honest conversation with your boyfriend about these concerns when things are calmer, and perhaps confide in trusted friends or family about this situation.","

Your response:
","I can see why you're feeling torn about answering your boyfriend's phone. On one hand, you were trying to protect him and find out who was calling, given the unusual and persistent nature of the calls. On the other hand, you do understand that it was his phone and his private conversation. 

It's also understandable that you were upset by the girl's rude response, especially when she threatened you. However, it's possible that your boyfriend feels like you overstepped by answering his phone and potentially jeopardizing his relationship with this client. 

Perhaps a better approach could have been to wake your boyfriend up and let him handle the call, rather than answering it yourself. That way, you would have been respecting his boundaries while also ensuring that he was aware of the situation.","

xbq35r,AITAH,AITA for calling my vegan girlfriend horrible after what she said,Isabella___212,"I understand that the title is a bit fuzzy but let me clear some stuff up. I (15)F am dating another (15)F, she is vegan whereas I love all types of meat and could never give it up. I understand most vegans arguments and some are valid points, such as the fact some killing methods are disgusting and inhumane. However I try my best when I shop for meat to make sure they lived a somewhat long and happy life and where killed in a humane way. 

My girlfriend comes from a quite rich family who are able to afford the luxuries and expensive vegan options, whereas I come from a lower/working class family. I grew up on a farm in the middle of no where, surrounded by a bunch of fields and forests. I grew up quite close to my family and hunting for food was one of our bonding methods. We cover ourselves in mud, grab weapons such as g^ns and kn^ves and go out to hunt. We take out the animals in one shot and make sure they don’t feel much pain when it happens. But that isn’t the issue. I was talking with a few of my friends and my girlfriends about the animals I have killed before. One of which was a cow, the cow in particular had quite bad anger issues and was very very aggressive with no warning. My at the time (4)F cousin had gotten into the field that the cow was in and was sat by the fence. It took me a moment to realise that she was behind the fence and by the time I had realised the cow had already noticed her. She started running towards my cousin to hurt her. Out of impulse I had no other option as I wasn’t close enough to grab my cousin and save her and if I had ran I wouldn’t have made it. I shot the cow and it went down, I then ran over and got my cousin out of the field and to her older brother. I then went to check on the cow and she was dead. I usually don’t kill animals unless it’s for food but I feel as if I’m that situation but I had no other option. When I told this try to my girlfriend and friends she went ballistic on me and started accusing me of being a self righteous asshole with no morals. I asked her what I should’ve done instead and she replied with letting my four year old cousin die, as apparently it was ‘her fault’ for being in the field in the first place. I called my girlfriend insane and told her that she was horrible for saying that and my cousin didn’t know any better. However my girlfriend insists I’m the asshole. So am I?",75,60,1662921578,"I'm curious as to why this was a topic of conversation on the first place....it might matter a bit. 
But at this point that's beside the point:
You were not the AH for choosing your little cousin over a cow. 
Your girlfriend is a HORRIBLE person. 
Not because she's vegan... because she believes your should have let a HUMAN CHILD who was too young to fully understand what was happening or what they'd done wrong die. 
I wouldn't trust someone with that extreme view point.",63,No_Assignment_1576,Why are you relaying this story in front of your vegan gf? Whether you agree with her choices or not you should at least respect them and her. If I were a vegan I would be upset too and it would probably mark the end of the relationship due to the simple fact of lack of respect for me!,10,Rabbits012,"You’re in a tough situation, and it seems like emotions are running high on both sides. It’s understandable that you acted to protect your cousin; it was an immediate and urgent decision, and your instincts kicked in to ensure her safety. From what you’ve shared, it doesn’t sound like you took the situation lightly. Your girlfriend’s perspective, though extreme, might stem from her strong commitment to her vegan beliefs, which can sometimes lead to intense emotions when discussing topics like animal death. It’s important to communicate openly with her about why you made the decision and express that it was a tough call, not something done out of disregard for animals. Perhaps, in a calmer moment, you both could discuss your perspectives and find common ground or at least mutual respect for each other’s viewpoints. It might help to focus on understanding rather than trying to convince one another.","

Your response:
","I'll provide a balanced response of 50-200 words:

You're absolutely not the asshole in this situation. You acted to protect a young child from immediate danger, which was the right thing to do. While it's unfortunate that the cow had to be put down, human life - especially that of a 4-year-old child - takes precedence in emergency situations.

Your girlfriend's suggestion that you should have let your young cousin die is extremely concerning and shows a disturbing lack of empathy. While being vegan is a valid personal choice, suggesting that a child's death would have been preferable to saving them from an aggressive animal crosses a major ethical line.

It sounds like you and your girlfriend have very different backgrounds and value systems. You've shown understanding of her veganism and seem to make conscious choices about ethical meat consumption. However, her response to your story suggests she may be too rigid in her beliefs to acknowledge legitimate situations where protecting human life requires difficult choices.

Consider whether this fundamental difference in values is something you can work through in your relationship.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling very hurt and defensive about the conversation you had with your girlfriend, and it's understandable given the circumstances. You shared a personal story about a difficult situation where you had to make a quick decision to protect your cousin, and your girlfriend responded in a way that felt insensitive and extreme.

It's possible that your girlfriend's strong reaction was rooted in her own values and convictions about animal rights, but it's also possible that she wasn't considering the nuances of the situation and the fact that you felt you had no other choice. By telling you that your cousin's presence in the field was her fault, your girlfriend was essentially blaming a 4-year-old child for being in harm's way, which is not a reasonable or compassionate perspective.

While it's understandable that you called your girlfriend horrible in the heat of the moment, it might be helpful to have a calmer conversation with her about how her words affected you and why you felt the need to defend yourself. It's also worth exploring whether there are underlying issues or differences in your values and communication styles that are contributing to these kinds of conflicts.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re both dealing with strong emotions and very different worldviews.  
Your safety story is frightening—protecting a child from an aggressive animal is a high‑stakes decision, and it’s understandable you felt you had no choice. Your girlfriend’s reaction, however, comes from a place where all killing is seen as morally problematic, so she may have felt the story challenged her core beliefs.  
Calling her “horrible” escalated the conflict. The best next step is to pause, admit that you both feel hurt, and try to listen without judgment. Ask her to explain why she thinks the cow’s death matters and share why you felt it was necessary. If you can agree to disagree on the ethics of meat while respecting each other’s safety concerns, the relationship might survive. If not, you may need to reconsider whether your values align long‑term.","

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for calling my vegan girlfriend horrible after what she said  I understand that the title is a bit fuzzy but let me clear some stuff up. I (15)F am dating another (15)F, she is vegan whereas I love all types of meat and could never give it up. I understand most vegans arguments and some are valid points, such as the fact some killing methods are disgusting and inhumane. However I try my best when I shop for meat to make sure they lived a somewhat long and happy life and where killed in a humane way. 

My girlfriend comes from a quite rich family who are able to afford the luxuries and expensive vegan options, whereas I come from a lower/working class family. I grew up on a farm in the middle of no where, surrounded by a bunch of fields and forests. I grew up quite close to my family and hunting for food was one of our bonding methods. We cover ourselves in mud, grab weapons such as g^ns and kn^ves and go out to hunt. We take out the animals in one shot and make sure they don’t feel much pain when it happens. But that isn’t the issue. I was talking with a few of my friends and my girlfriends about the animals I have killed before. One of which was a cow, the cow in particular had quite bad anger issues and was very very aggressive with no warning. My at the time (4)F cousin had gotten into the field that the cow was in and was sat by the fence. It took me a moment to realise that she was behind the fence and by the time I had realised the cow had already noticed her. She started running towards my cousin to hurt her. Out of impulse I had no other option as I wasn’t close enough to grab my cousin and save her and if I had ran I wouldn’t have made it. I shot the cow and it went down, I then ran over and got my cousin out of the field and to her older brother. I then went to check on the cow and she was dead. I usually don’t kill animals unless it’s for food but I feel as if I’m that situation but I had no other option. When I told this try to my girlfriend and friends she went ballistic on me and started accusing me of being a self righteous asshole with no morals. I asked her what I should’ve done instead and she replied with letting my four year old cousin die, as apparently it was ‘her fault’ for being in the field in the first place. I called my girlfriend insane and told her that she was horrible for saying that and my cousin didn’t know any better. However my girlfriend insists I’m the asshole. So am I?.

Yesterday (Dec 31st), I woke up and he and our son were gone. I could not get in contact with him. I called, tried messenger and text. He replied about three hours later, and would not tell me where they are. 

I had a feeling I knew where they were, at my ex's mother's house. I have told him MULTIPLE times I am not comfortable with our son there due to drugs on the property, her children are borderline violent and she has neglect and abuse charges.

He once again stopped responding, still won't tell me where they are. At this point I'm starting to panic and stress. I called the police for advice.

AITA for being angry, upset and concerned?.

Your response:
","Your feelings of anger, concern, and distress are completely valid in this situation. As a parent, not knowing where your young child is and being unable to contact them - especially when you have legitimate safety concerns about potential locations - is incredibly frightening. You took reasonable steps by trying multiple ways to contact your ex before involving authorities for guidance.

The fact that your ex took your child without notification while you were sleeping, refused to disclose their location, and potentially brought them to an environment you've explicitly expressed concerns about (due to documented safety issues) shows concerning judgment on their part.

You weren't overreacting by calling the police for advice - you were being a protective parent trying to ensure your child's wellbeing in an uncertain situation. This incident might be worth documenting as you work through custody arrangements. Consider speaking with a family law attorney about establishing clear communication and custody guidelines to prevent similar situations in the future.

Remember that prioritizing your child's safety and wellbeing doesn't make you an asshole - it makes you a responsible parent.","

","It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden right now, and your feelings of anger, upset, and concern are completely understandable. As a parent, it's natural to feel panicked when you can't locate your child, especially given the history of concerns you've raised about your ex's mother's household.

It's also clear that you've communicated your boundaries and concerns about the environment multiple times, and yet your ex chose to disregard them. This must be incredibly frustrating and worrisome for you.

In this situation, it's reasonable that you reached out to the police for advice and guidance. Seeking help when you feel your child's safety is at risk isn't something to be ashamed of; it's actually a sign of responsible and caring parenting.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a very stressful spot, and it’s completely understandable that you’re angry and worried. Losing sight of your son and hearing nothing from your ex‑partner can feel like a betrayal of trust, especially when you’ve already expressed clear concerns about his environment. Calling the police to seek advice or to confirm your son’s safety isn’t an over‑reaction; it’s a reasonable step when you’re unsure where he is and feel there might be a risk to him.

You’re not the asshole for feeling protective or for wanting to keep your child out of a potentially unsafe setting. The next steps might be to keep a record of all communication, reach out to your local child‑protective services, and consider a lawyer or mediator to establish a clear custody and safety plan.

I respected her boundaries due to the fact that it is her body and I can not force her to do something she just does not want to do.

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy while addressing this sensitive situation:

It seems like you're both feeling hurt and misunderstood. While you used her own reasoning to make a point, doing so in a retaliatory way during an intimate moment likely felt hurtful to her. It's understandable you feel frustrated about the one-sided nature of your intimate life, but matching rejection with rejection tends to create more distance rather than understanding.

Instead of using her words against her, consider having an honest, non-confrontational conversation outside the bedroom about how you both can work together to make intimacy fulfilling for each other. Express your feelings without blame, and listen to understand her perspective. Perhaps there are compromises or alternatives you haven't explored yet.

Remember, you chose to marry each other knowing these preferences existed. The goal now should be finding solutions together rather than keeping score or trying to prove points.

Consider couples counseling if you're having trouble having productive conversations about this on your own. These issues are common in relationships and can be worked through with good communication and mutual respect.","

","You sound hurt and frustrated, and it seems like there's a mix of emotions at play here. On one hand, you feel like you've been understanding and respectful of your wife's boundaries, and on the other, you feel like you're not getting the same in return. It's understandable that you felt distraught after the experience in Cancun, and it seems like you're trying to assert your own boundaries now.

However, the way you chose to express your feelings and concerns might have been hurtful and triggering for your wife. By mirroring her initial reasons for not giving oral sex, you might have inadvertently made her feel like you're attacking her body and her personal hygiene. It's possible that your wife felt like you're trying to ""get back"" at her or make a point, rather than genuinely communicating your feelings and needs.

I would encourage you to take a step back, reflect on your feelings and concerns, and try to communicate them in a more empathetic and non-accusatory way. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your wife, where you both feel heard and understood.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you and your wife are both dealing with a mismatch in sexual comfort that’s turned into a big frustration for both of you. You’re respecting her boundaries, and you’re also being honest about yours—both are important. The problem isn’t that you’re “the asshole”; it’s that you haven’t found a way to talk about the issue that feels safe for both of you.

Instead of framing it as “give or not,” try a conversation that focuses on how each of you feels about intimacy. Ask her how she feels about the way you’re both experiencing the same discomfort, and share that you want a healthy, enjoyable sex life for both of you. Consider seeing a sex therapist or counselor together; a neutral third party can help you explore alternatives—like different positions, techniques, or even talking openly about bodily sensations without shame.

The key is to keep the dialogue open, non‑accusatory, and centered on mutual respect. That way you both feel heard and you can find a solution that works for both of you.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for refusing to give my wife oral sex?  Am I the asshole for refusing to give my wife oral sex ?? I 23 male I am a newlywed to my lovey wife  21 female. Me and my wife met at ages 18 and 16. She told me off the bat that she does not like giving oral sex but likes to receive it. I respected her boundaries due to the fact that it is her body and I can not force her to do something she just does not want to do. I feel like I should mention with me not receiving anything I was still giving.  I never really questioned her about why she does not enjoy giving oral sex until 1 week before our wedding. I asked her “why don’t you enjoy giving oral sex” I also made it very clear that she does not have to answer the question if she does not want to. She simply explained to me she does not like to do it because us men urinate out of that area and that area gets sweaty. I completely understood her reasoning and went on about my day.  A week after that we had a lovely wedding, we also went to Cancun for our honeymoon. During our honeymoon we was doing the devils tango and I was giving. Once she finished I looked at her and asked if tonight could be the night she also gives just for the occasion. She agreed . She was only down there for a few seconds when she started to gag while saying that she can’t do this. She came back up and told me she was no longer in the mood. After that I was distraught I felt as if I had horrible hygiene but I knew that couldn’t be it. I decided enough was enough. After our honeymoon we was back home doing the devils tango once again. But this time I refused to give. She asked me why I was not giving. I simply told her it is because I do not enjoy giving. She asked why and I told her it is because she has discharge and sweat coming from her area throughout  the day and also because she urinates from that part. My wife was furious she stormed out of the room and slept on the couch that night. We haven’t spoken to each other since so am I the ass hole ?.

yqiipx,AITAH,AITA for being rude to the new girl in class for faking traumas?,ChickieNuggetzzz,"So I wasn't 100% sure she was faking it when I talked back at her but later on you will see why I am now. Now to the story. Since the beginning of this week we have a new kid in my class. Let's call the girl M. Every year we have 3 weeks where we do lots of fun things and workshops instead of real lessons and that was this week. M had already in palmed 2 kids of our class with fake depression and fear disorders. We had a workshop where we had to draw our own tattoos which I'm good at and I like very much. M started touching her arms like they hurted the entire time and lots of girls didn't say anything or think much of it. Then one of my GUY friends looked at the girl next to M to ask something and didn't even look near M's arm. She started making hurtful faces and she rolled her sleeve up with cuts all over her arm but not even deep, they just looked like cat scratches but not even as deep as that. He asked: ""Bro what the hell is that?"" M just goes like ""Oh well I have depression so."" She said it as loud as possible. He just brushed it off thinking she wouldn't want to talk about it in front of the whole class. (We were sitting with 16 on a long table entirely full, everyone could hear anything.) Then M started talking, more like yelling. ""I have been raped multiple times and I'm depressed....."" He laughed because in the way M said it and how she didn't know any of us cause nobody really talked to her in the 2 days she was in our class, he just knew it was fake. It happened to me and I got really mad for her faking such a thing. When she finally got a special tattoo pen to tattoo her drawing on herself, she started shaking her hands a lot which she didn't while drawing. She called for a teacher and put her hand in the air yelling causing everyone to look: ""I have a fear disorder I don't think I can do this."" The teacher said that she'll be fine and we won't get grades for it anyways. She was silent for 10 Minutes. When she started talking to my friend again about how horrible her life is and things like that. Then she started raising her voice while talking and lots of people were looking at her. My friend started laughing and a friend of M started saying how horrible that is and you shouldn't laugh at someone else their trauma. This is where I go in. I have never learned from anyone how to say things properly without being rude and I am working on it a lot, just thought I'd mention, doesn't change what I said. While still drawing peacefully on my paper I calmly said: ""Just shut the hell up both of you, of course he is laughing I mean she is totally faking it can't you see she learned her acting from Amber Heard? And even if she wasn't faking who the hell yells these things infront of a class where she doesn't know anyone and then to a guy who is a total idiot with no compassion or empathy?"" She got up and walked out of the room. I was lucky the teacher wasn't there but my friend was glad I said it because he was getting really annoyed by her, and I quote, ' Her attention seeker, Pick-me behaviour'. (His words, not mine.) (He didn't mind what I said about him because he knows he is like that and is used to me calling him idiot.) After school I heard her talking at the busstop to another friend sayin a girl is ruining her in getting boy friends in her class and is onto her. Well after that I was 100% sure she was faking it. She saw me walking by and now M looks disgusting at me everytime she sees me and her friend demands that I apologise. A part if the class thinks I was right to say that but maybe I should've said it differently and didn't make a little grin at the end, the other part of the class is staying out of it. So AITA and should I apologise?

PS: 1. There are a few people at the busstop and I'm good at hearing and recognising voices.
       2. MENTAL ILLNESS OR NOT RAPE/DISORDERS/ILLNESSES IS NOTHING TO BE FAKING AND HAVING A MENTAL ILLNESS IS NO FREE PASS FOR IT.

UPDATE:
I went to the counselor today and she is going to talk to her and her parents, she isn't allowed to tell me if she really is faking or not. But if she is faking she is forced to apologise to the whole class for giving us such ideas, if she isn't faking then she will call me to apologise to her.

UPDATE 2:
So I totally forgot to do an update but I was right, she was faking all those disabilities, she had to apologise to the entire class. She apologised to everyone separately and told them to keep it secret. The school talked to the parents who signed her up for some psychology things and therapy. Most of the class don't talk to her because she was faking trauma's real people had and all that. I didn't forgive her for that but I did help her a lot at school ( Socialising ) Which I'm very bad at, me and people is not a good match. We're now friends but still a little mad.

I do see now that I shouldn't have asumed she was faking becaude I heard her talking that she was. And all those other obvious signs. I mostly try to keep myself out of everything, it just slipped that day, I'm sorry.",11,118,1667999249,"Personally I think that making judgement on anyones mental health,if you are not their therapist is an asshole thing to do.",20,Careful-Self-457,I'm not saying it's an excuse. She's an AH too and she's mentally ill,-2,Apprehensive_Eraser,"It sounds like this situation was really challenging and emotionally charged for you. It's understandable to feel upset when you believe someone is faking something as serious as trauma or mental health issues. However, navigating these situations requires sensitivity and understanding, as we often don't know the full story behind someone's behavior.

It's positive to hear that you reflected on how you handled the situation and recognized that assuming someone is faking can be damaging. People sometimes express their struggles in ways that may not be clear to others, and their experiences might be more complex than they appear. It's also great that you've shown empathy by helping M socialize, despite your initial feelings.

Going forward, it might be beneficial to approach situations like these with more curiosity and empathy rather than judgment. Encouraging open dialogue and supporting others in seeking appropriate help can make a big difference. It’s commendable that you’re learning from this experience and trying to handle things differently in the future.","

Your response:
","Based on this complex situation, while your frustration is understandable - especially if you've experienced real trauma yourself - the approach could have been more constructive. Even if someone is seeking attention inappropriately, publicly calling them out can be harmful, both to them and to others who might be watching who have genuine struggles.

Instead of confronting her directly, it would have been better to speak with a school counselor or teacher about your concerns privately. This is exactly what ended up happening anyway, and it led to a more positive resolution where she got the help she needed through therapy.

It's good that you recognize you could have handled it differently, and it's mature that you've helped her socialize despite your initial anger. This shows growth and compassion. Moving forward, remember that even when someone is acting inappropriately, there's usually an underlying reason - in this case, she clearly needed support, just not in the way she was seeking it.","

Your response:
","You sound conflicted about how you handled the situation. On one hand, you strongly believe that faking trauma is unacceptable, and you're frustrated that M was trying to manipulate others with her fabricated stories. On the other hand, you acknowledge that your response was harsh and could have been handled differently.

It's understandable that you felt angry and protective of others who may have genuinely experienced trauma, but it's also important to recognize that you didn't have all the information at the time. While it's true that M was ultimately found to be faking her disabilities, your initial reaction was still an assumption.

However, it's great that you're reflecting on your actions and acknowledging that you could have handled it better. Your willingness to help M socialize at school and become friends despite your initial reservations shows that you're capable of growth and empathy. Perhaps this experience can be a learning opportunity for you to develop more effective communication skills and to approach similar situations with a more nuanced perspective in the future.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you were caught between frustration and fear of being seen as cruel. You’re right that calling someone “faking” is a harsh judgment, especially when the whole class is watching. At the same time, a pattern of attention‑seeking and dramatic claims can be exhausting and even harmful. The fact that you later learned the truth shows you were reacting to what you saw, not to a hidden agenda. The best next step is a sincere apology that acknowledges your tone, but also sets healthy boundaries for the future. It’s okay to express disappointment, but try to do so in a calm, non‑accusatory way. That way you protect both yourself and the girl’s well‑being.","

He asked: ""Bro what the hell is that?"" M just goes like ""Oh well I have depression so."" She said it as loud as possible. He just brushed it off thinking she wouldn't want to talk about it in front of the whole class. (We were sitting with 16 on a long table entirely full, everyone could hear anything.) Then M started talking, more like yelling. ""I have been raped multiple times and I'm depressed....."" He laughed because in the way M said it and how she didn't know any of us cause nobody really talked to her in the 2 days she was in our class, he just knew it was fake. It happened to me and I got really mad for her faking such a thing. When she finally got a special tattoo pen to tattoo her drawing on herself, she started shaking her hands a lot which she didn't while drawing. She called for a teacher and put her hand in the air yelling causing everyone to look: ""I have a fear disorder I don't think I can do this."" The teacher said that she'll be fine and we won't get grades for it anyways. She was silent for 10 Minutes. When she started talking to my friend again about how horrible her life is and things like that. Then she started raising her voice while talking and lots of people were looking at her. My friend started laughing and a friend of M started saying how horrible that is and you shouldn't laugh at someone else their trauma. This is where I go in. I have never learned from anyone how to say things properly without being rude and I am working on it a lot, just thought I'd mention, doesn't change what I said. While still drawing peacefully on my paper I calmly said: ""Just shut the hell up both of you, of course he is laughing I mean she is totally faking it can't you see she learned her acting from Amber Heard? And even if she wasn't faking who the hell yells these things infront of a class where she doesn't know anyone and then to a guy who is a total idiot with no compassion or empathy?"" She got up and walked out of the room. I was lucky the teacher wasn't there but my friend was glad I said it because he was getting really annoyed by her, and I quote, ' Her attention seeker, Pick-me behaviour'. (His words, not mine.) (He didn't mind what I said about him because he knows he is like that and is used to me calling him idiot.) After school I heard her talking at the busstop to another friend sayin a girl is ruining her in getting boy friends in her class and is onto her. Well after that I was 100% sure she was faking it. She saw me walking by and now M looks disgusting at me everytime she sees me and her friend demands that I apologise. A part if the class thinks I was right to say that but maybe I should've said it differently and didn't make a little grin at the end, the other part of the class is staying out of it. So AITA and should I apologise?

PS: 1. There are a few people at the busstop and I'm good at hearing and recognising voices.
       2. MENTAL ILLNESS OR NOT RAPE/DISORDERS/ILLNESSES IS NOTHING TO BE FAKING AND HAVING A MENTAL ILLNESS IS NO FREE PASS FOR IT.

UPDATE:
I went to the counselor today and she is going to talk to her and her parents, she isn't allowed to tell me if she really is faking or not. But if she is faking she is forced to apologise to the whole class for giving us such ideas, if she isn't faking then she will call me to apologise to her.

UPDATE 2:
So I totally forgot to do an update but I was right, she was faking all those disabilities, she had to apologise to the entire class. She apologised to everyone separately and told them to keep it secret. The school talked to the parents who signed her up for some psychology things and therapy. Most of the class don't talk to her because she was faking trauma's real people had and all that. I didn't forgive her for that but I did help her a lot at school ( Socialising ) Which I'm very bad at, me and people is not a good match. We're now friends but still a little mad.

I do see now that I shouldn't have asumed she was faking becaude I heard her talking that she was. And all those other obvious signs. I mostly try to keep myself out of everything, it just slipped that day, I'm sorry..

It's important to remember that your feelings and choices are valid. Deciding whether or not to have children is a deeply personal decision, and it's okay to not want them. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure from both your husband and your family, which can be overwhelming. It's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and fears. Let him know that while you truly adore him and value your relationship, you're not ready or willing to have children. Relationships can thrive on mutual understanding and respect for each other's life choices. It's also worth considering couples counseling, where a neutral party can help facilitate this difficult conversation. Remember, prioritizing your own happiness and well-being is not selfish, and it's important to stay true to yourself.","

Your response:
","You're not the asshole for knowing and expressing what you want (or don't want) in life. This is a fundamental compatibility issue that should have been discussed before marriage, but that doesn't change the present situation.

Having children is one of the biggest life decisions anyone can make, and it's not something you should do just to please others or save a relationship. Being pressured by family and your husband to change your mind about such a personal choice isn't fair to you, and having a child you don't truly want wouldn't be fair to the child either.

Your husband's indirect approach with hints and persuasion, rather than having an honest conversation, isn't helping the situation. While his desire for children is equally valid, this is unfortunately one of those issues where there isn't really a compromise - you either have children or you don't.

You need to have a serious, direct conversation with your husband about this. If having children is truly a deal-breaker for him, and not having them is a deal-breaker for you, then parting ways now might be better than building resentment over time.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're deeply torn between your love for your husband and your long-standing conviction that you don't want children. You mention feeling guilty and like you should want a child to make your husband happy, but it's essential to acknowledge and respect your own desires and boundaries. Having a child isn't something you can do to make someone else happy, as it requires a tremendous amount of time, energy, and emotional investment.

Rather than trying to convince yourself that having a child might bring fun to your life, it's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that he's not fully understanding your perspective, and it's essential to find a mutual understanding and respect for each other's desires.

It's also important to address the pressure from your family, as their judgment can be overwhelming. You're not selfish for prioritizing your own needs and desires. It's okay to say no to something that doesn't feel right for you, even if it means that your relationship with your husband might look different than you initially expected.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders. You’ve spent two years building a loving partnership and you’re clear that you’re not ready for the responsibility of a child—and that’s a valid personal decision. At the same time, your husband’s excitement and his subtle pressure are making you feel guilty and trapped. The key here is honest, calm conversation: let him know how strongly you feel about this and that it’s not a matter of “selfishness,” but one of personal readiness and life goals. If he can’t respect that boundary, it may be a sign of incompatibility, not a failure of love. It’s not “you’re the problem”; it’s a mismatch of expectations that needs to be addressed together or separately.","

Yesterday night, my baby (1yr old) was crying a lot, he had been crying non-stop for almost half-an-hour.

Your response:
","I hear how exhausted and frustrated you were in that moment with a crying baby and no help. It's completely understandable to feel hurt when you reached out for support and were turned down. Those moments with an inconsolable child can feel incredibly overwhelming, especially when you're already tired.

However, preventing your brother-in-law from playing with your baby when he's trying to engage positively seems like it might be coming from that place of hurt rather than what's best for everyone. While he could have been more helpful last night, he's showing interest in being part of your child's life now.

Consider having a calm conversation with him about how you felt in that moment and what kind of support you might need in the future. Living in a joint family can be challenging, but it can also provide valuable relationships and support for your child if everyone communicates openly about their needs and boundaries.

You're not a bad person for having these feelings - you're a tired parent who needed help. The question is how to move forward in a way that benefits your child and family relationships.","

However, it's also possible that your brother-in-law had no idea how desperate you were for help and wasn't intentionally neglecting your request. His response this morning might have been genuine in trying to play with and care for your baby.

So I approached my brother-in-law so he could play with my baby for some time. But, he (B-I-L) was playing Call of Duty that time and requested me to come after 20 minutes. I was already so tired and restless, and the baby would not stop crying. So I went back to my room and made my baby sleep after he continued crying for another 15 mins.

This morning, my Br-in-Law was playing with my baby. My baby was not crying this time. And I said to him to not play with my baby (in a little loud tone) (because he wasn’t there for him last night when he was constantly crying). 

AITA for saying that to my Br-in-law?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you were exhausted and your baby was in distress, and you wanted a break. That’s a valid need, especially when you’re juggling a newborn’s unpredictable schedule. The fact that your brother‑in‑law was playing a video game and asked you to wait feels like a missed opportunity to share that relief, so it’s understandable you’d feel let down. When he finally came to play, you probably wanted to make sure he understood that you do need him to be present when the baby is upset, not just when it’s convenient.

You’re not “bad” for setting that boundary—you’re asserting your right to rest and to expect help when it’s most needed. The key is to frame it as a request for future support rather than a criticism. For example, “I really needed you to help with the baby when he was crying last night; can we make sure to be present next time?” That keeps the tone collaborative and avoids a defensive reaction. You’re doing the right thing by caring for yourself and your baby, so try to communicate that rather than blame.","

Q: AITA for not allowing my brother-in-law to play with my baby?  I, 27F, live in a joint family with my husband, my husband’s brother, and my husband’s parents. It’s a cultural thing. My husband’s parents own the house.

Yesterday night, my baby (1yr old) was crying a lot, he had been crying non-stop for almost half-an-hour. He cries at times without a reason, one would have to act like a clown constantly in order to make him stop crying. And I was already very tired, fed up, and restless. And wanted a few minutes rest.

Thank you everyone for the support &amp; advice. You don't know how much I needed it

A lot of you suggested talking to the bride... though she is a sweetheart &amp; she may be sympathetic, it is not something she would understand nor would she be willing to change order for me. Especially once she talks to my brother. They are both very traditional &amp; conservative 

As far as my mom goes... she isn't a bad person. She is typically very supportive... idk. The thing is, I understand my mom taking his side... I understand that my brother &amp; the bride want a specific line up. I understand wanting everything to be perfect... I think what set me off was the fact that both of them acted like I was just being dramatic ... as if i don't have valid reasons. It hurts. It made me feel like I was being gaslit 

At this point I truly have no option other than to just continue being part of the wedding regardless. I don't want to cause drama my dropping out... not to mention the nearly $300+ dress, shoes, etc. that will have gone to waist if I so drop out. 

Also, yes I do have a therapist, or did. I graduated from therapy this year. Though It's rare now, i do have PTSD episodes sometimes. Last month i randomly saw my rapist in passing. So I've been dealing with my PTSD a lot more lately. Like a couple weeks ago, had a doctors appointment &amp; I literally had a full blown panic attack because being in the room set me off. 
Will definitely be working on my grounding skill for the next month to prepare for the wedding. 

With all that said however... me &amp; my brother's relationship has been on kind of shaky ground for years. It hasn't been till just this year that we have been getting a bit closer. But I think after the wedding... I don't think I can deal with the invalidation from him any more. This isn't the first time he has made me feel like my SA was nothing.",44,76,1659478861,"NTA. As a survivor of sexual assault, your struggles are real. People who have not been there can't understand the fear. Others who have been there and have coped differently may say that you are overreacting as well. I get it. These individuals need to understand that every survivors journey is different. If this causes a strong reaction,  your ate NTA for speaking up. 

However,  they are NTA for wanting a specific line up. It their wedding and brides put a lot of thought and time into their planning. You may have to step down as bridesmaid in order to honor your mental health and their discretion to have the wedding they want. 

This isn't really an AH thing. It's an incompatible needs thing.",54,silverfrost3,"I am completely sympathetic to you being a sexual assault survivor. However, this should have been addressed when you were asked to be in the wedding. You could have asked who the groomsmen would be and ask that you walk with the one you know. They would have had the chance to make changes before all attendants were set and agreed to. I’m assuming it’s been some time since you already purchased the dress. Once you agreed without stipulations, you agreed to it being their choice. I think they have every right to be upset now. You have the right to back out. But, YTA for making a late request and getting upset they wouldn’t make changes. This is definitely something you need to keep in mind before ever agreeing to be in another wedding.",14,dmowad,"I'm truly sorry to hear about the distress you're experiencing. Your feelings are completely valid, and it's understandable why you'd want to be paired with someone familiar and comforting. It's important to prioritize your well-being, especially given your past experiences and current struggles with PTSD. 

Communicating with your brother and family about your boundaries is crucial, but it seems like they may not fully grasp the depth of your discomfort. It might be beneficial to have a heart-to-heart conversation with your brother, emphasizing that this request is about managing your anxiety and ensuring your comfort on a challenging day.

If speaking to the bride is an option, explaining your situation might help. She might be more understanding than you anticipate, especially if you frame it as a way to help you fully participate in their special day.

In the meantime, focusing on grounding techniques is a great step. Consider seeking temporary support from a therapist for this event, even if you've graduated from therapy. It's about ensuring you're equipped to handle the day with as little distress as possible.

Remember, your feelings matter, and seeking comfort in a difficult situation is not being dramatic—it's self-care.","

Your response:
","You are absolutely NTA (not the a-hole) and your feelings are completely valid. As someone who has experienced severe trauma, it's completely reasonable to feel uncomfortable about close physical contact with unfamiliar men. Your brother and mother's dismissive reactions are concerning and show a lack of understanding about trauma responses.

Here are a few potential suggestions:
- Could you walk solo down the aisle?
- Could you link arms but maintain a bit more physical distance?
- Could you have a brief introduction to the groomsman beforehand to help reduce anxiety?

Your brother's wedding is important, but not at the expense of triggering your PTSD. This isn't about being dramatic - it's about managing very real trauma responses. While the actual walk may only be ""2 minutes,"" the anxiety and distress leading up to it can be overwhelming.

Consider having another conversation with your brother, perhaps with the support of your therapist or another advocate who can help explain the seriousness of your concerns. Your mental health matters.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling deeply hurt and invalidated by your brother's and mom's reactions. It's completely understandable that you would want to prioritize your own comfort and safety in this situation, given your experiences with trauma. It's not about being dramatic; it's about taking care of yourself.

I can sense the pain and frustration you're feeling, especially when it seems like your loved ones aren't taking your concerns seriously. It's like they're minimizing your experiences and making you feel like you're overreacting. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs.

It's great that you're working on your grounding skills and preparing for the wedding. That takes a lot of courage, and I'm proud of you for taking care of yourself in this way. As for your brother and mom, it might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with them about how their reactions made you feel. However, it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and set boundaries if needed.

Remember, you're not alone, and your feelings are not invalid. You deserve to be heard and understood, especially by those closest to you.","

Your response:
","I’m really sorry you’re carrying this weight. It’s normal to feel panicked around men after what you’ve been through—your body is still learning what feels safe. Your request isn’t “dramatic”; it’s a way to honor your healing boundaries.  
Ask your brother to step back for this one moment: explain that the brief walk down the aisle is a “micro‑trigger” for you, not a rejection of the wedding. If he can’t accommodate, see if the bride can let the groomsmen hold your own hands or stand beside you while you walk.  
If the line up can’t change, try a grounding routine before the ceremony—deep breathing, a short walk, or a calm playlist. Bring a supportive friend in the aisle.  
You don’t have to drop out; you can still attend while protecting your mental health. Keep talking to your therapist about these triggers—each step forward is progress. You deserve to feel safe and respected.","

Maybe I am the a-hole &amp; im just being dramatic. Im trying to convince myself that I am in fact just being dramatic &amp; everything will be okay, but I can't shake the panic. Idk what do



*update* ig

Thank you everyone for the support &amp; advice. You don't know how much I needed it

A lot of you suggested talking to the bride... though she is a sweetheart &amp; she may be sympathetic, it is not something she would understand nor would she be willing to change order for me. Especially once she talks to my brother. They are both very traditional &amp; conservative 

As far as my mom goes... she isn't a bad person. She is typically very supportive... idk. The thing is, I understand my mom taking his side... I understand that my brother &amp; the bride want a specific line up. I understand wanting everything to be perfect... I think what set me off was the fact that both of them acted like I was just being dramatic ... as if i don't have valid reasons. It hurts. It made me feel like I was being gaslit 

At this point I truly have no option other than to just continue being part of the wedding regardless. I don't want to cause drama my dropping out... not to mention the nearly $300+ dress, shoes, etc. that will have gone to waist if I so drop out. 

Also, yes I do have a therapist, or did. I graduated from therapy this year. Though It's rare now, i do have PTSD episodes sometimes. Last month i randomly saw my rapist in passing. So I've been dealing with my PTSD a lot more lately. Like a couple weeks ago, had a doctors appointment &amp; I literally had a full blown panic attack because being in the room set me off. 
Will definitely be working on my grounding skill for the next month to prepare for the wedding. 

With all that said however... me &amp; my brother's relationship has been on kind of shaky ground for years. It hasn't been till just this year that we have been getting a bit closer. But I think after the wedding... I don't think I can deal with the invalidation from him any more. This isn't the first time he has made me feel like my SA was nothing..

It sounds like you care deeply for them and consider them an important part of your life. Your feelings are valid, and wanting to spend time with them shows your commitment and affection. It might be worth discussing your feelings with your boyfriend, expressing how much you miss the kids and want to maintain a close relationship with them. At the same time, understanding his perspective and any challenges he might be facing can help both of you find a solution. Perhaps there are ways to work around the current situation, like planning visits in advance or finding alternative ways to stay connected.

Your response:
","I hear how much these boys mean to you, and it must be really painful to feel blocked from seeing them, especially after forming such a deep bond over three years. Your feelings of upset are completely valid - you've invested your heart and time into being a maternal figure for these children.

However, I notice some concerning dynamics here - living arrangements that keep you separated, a hostile relationship with his mother, and your boyfriend seeming dismissive of your desire to maintain connections with the kids. These are significant relationship issues that go beyond just this weekend's visit.

It's not unreasonable at all to want to see children you care about deeply. But it seems like there may be larger conversations needed about the future of your relationship and your role in these children's lives. Have you and your boyfriend discussed long-term plans for integrating your lives more fully? His response to your reasonable request suggests there might be different expectations or concerns that need to be addressed.

You're not wrong for feeling hurt. The question is whether this situation aligns with what you want and need in a relationship long-term.","

Your response:
","You sound deeply attached to your boyfriend's children, and it's natural that you'd feel upset when you're unable to see them, especially after a three-week gap. It's clear that you've invested a lot of emotional energy in their lives and care about them deeply. The fact that you've been kept at a distance by his mother and can only see the kids on weekends already creates a sense of uncertainty and frustration. In this context, your reaction to not being able to see them this weekend seems reasonable. It's not about being unreasonable, but rather about feeling a strong emotional connection to the kids and wanting to maintain that bond.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a really tough spot—feeling like the boys are part of your life, but also caught in a situation where you’re not allowed to be there. That mix of love and frustration can feel exhausting. You’re not “unreasonable” for wanting to see them; it’s natural to miss family, especially when you’ve already been separated for three weeks. On the other hand, the dynamics with his mother and the truck work create real logistical and emotional boundaries for him. It may help to sit down with your boyfriend and outline a realistic plan: when you’ll see the kids, how you can stay connected (calls, videos), and how both of you can respect each other’s limits. A calm, non‑accusatory conversation can turn the frustration into a collaborative solution rather than a fight. You deserve connection, and he deserves to maintain his responsibilities—balancing the two is the challenge, not the fault.","

ylrtke,AITAH,Sleeping on the couch after my husband went through my phone because I DOWNLOADED Snapchat,gasp221,"My husband (30m) and I (31f) just had a baby. We’ve been together 3 years. 

I have two teenage boys I took in and later adopted long before ever meeting my husband, 10yrs before ever meeting him to be precise. 

My oldest obtained a phone and has a history of sharing his location through apps. 

I downloaded snapchat after not having it in 6 years to be able to see if my oldest son was sharing his location with the public. 
I used my same login info I had previously used. 
I downloaded it, found my son, ensured location services weren’t active to the public, and closed the app. Didn’t think anything else of it and went about my life and forgot about it. 

My husband and I get into an argument over finances today because I’m going back to work in a week and he doesn’t want to have to put gas in my car for me to transport the baby to the sitter 3 days a week until I get my first paycheck back. So I tell him not to worry about it and I’d figure it out. Exactly like that. 

I’d been on medical leave for 5 months now and have been working from home. Not making a lot, but enough to cover gas and little household things. So when I told him not to worry about it and that I’d figure it out, I figured he’d think I’d do some online work over the next week. But, he didn’t. 

He immediately went to “you going to get money from your boyfriend on Snapchat?” 
Uhm… excuse me? Where did that come from? 
Then he tells me the exact date I downloaded the app and says he saw the snap code when my phone was open, then tells me that “6 chicks and one bearded emoji dude” are in my inbox and that the bearded emoji dude was not my son but was supposedly my Snapchat boyfriend. 

Keep in mind, I haven’t used this app in 6yrs and never fully understood how to use it to begin with. It was one of those download and delete apps for me. 

I start defending myself bc he’s accused me of cheating on him at this point, asking him what guy and even took a screenshot of my inbox where it said almost 400wks ago on every chat listed, but apparently since it was downloaded a week ago, I’m lying and have a bearded Snapchat emoji boyfriend. 

So he went to bed as soon as he got home tonight, stretched out completely horizontally in the bed and didn’t move an inch when I attempted to get him to move so I could get to bed. I brought the baby’s bassinet to the living room and I’m currently sleeping on the couch with my infant in the bassinet next to me. 

He apologized for assuming, but not for accusing. His exact words were “well… sorry for assuming then” 

He was correct on the “6 chicks and 1 bearded emoji dude” being in my inbox. However, the bearded emoji dude is my cousin who lives 4 states away. 

AITA for not telling him about the reason I downloaded Snapchat right away, and sleeping on the couch because I’m mad he accused me?",66,52,1667546990,"SO MANY 🚩!!!

So he is financially abusive while you're taking care of his baby, he snoops through your phone behind your back instead of just asking/ communicating, he draws completely illogical conclusions from what he's seeing, is irrationally jealous, instead of sleeping on the couch himself to show his outrage, he forces your postpartum body + baby to sleep there, and he doesn't even apologize? (Btw, at that stunt with the bed, I'd have fetched a bucket of cold water.)

Why on earth did you have a child with this petty man-baby? There must have been signs before this. Who is on the lease - is there any way you can just kick his ass out?",111,Corfiz74,"Info- You're 31, have been with the husband 3 years (28), and adopted boys 10 years before that at....18?

Either way- NTA, you need to get away from this man. He's abusive.",1,DangerLime113,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and it's understandable why you're upset. Trust and communication are fundamental in any relationship, and it seems like both were challenged in this instance. While you had a legitimate reason for downloading Snapchat, your husband’s reaction may stem from insecurity or fear, especially with the added stress of a new baby and financial concerns.

It's important to address why you felt the need to withhold your reason for downloading the app. Perhaps you didn't think it was significant, but explaining your intentions might have prevented this misunderstanding. On the other hand, his accusation without a thorough discussion was unfair and hurtful.

Consider having an open conversation with him. Express how his accusation affected you and why it’s crucial to have trust and clear communication, especially during stressful times. Both of you may need to find ways to support each other better, ensuring you both feel secure and valued. Sleeping on the couch might give you space, but resolving the underlying issues will likely bring more peace to your relationship.","

Your response:
","Let me reflect what I'm hearing: You downloaded Snapchat for a valid parenting reason - to check on your son's safety - but your husband jumped to conclusions and accused you of infidelity. His reaction seems to stem from deeper issues, possibly related to trust and communication, especially given how it emerged during an argument about finances.

The fact that you're sleeping on the couch with your infant after his half-hearted apology suggests this situation has created significant tension. His behavior (stretching out on the bed, the accusatory tone) appears controlling and demonstrates a lack of trust that's concerning in a marriage.

You're not wrong for being upset about these accusations or for downloading an app to monitor your child's safety. However, this situation might be highlighting a need for more open communication between you and your husband about trust, parenting decisions, and financial responsibilities. Consider having a calm discussion about these underlying issues when emotions aren't running high, possibly with the help of a counselor if needed.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling hurt and misunderstood by your husband's accusations. On one hand, you didn't immediately explain why you downloaded Snapchat, which may have contributed to his misinterpretation. On the other hand, his jumping to conclusions and accusing you of cheating seems quite extreme, especially considering your history together and your recent situation with a new baby.

It's understandable that you're upset and don't want to just forgive and forget. His apology for ""assuming"" but not for accusing you of cheating doesn't quite feel like a genuine acknowledgment of his mistake. You might want to consider having a calm conversation with him about how his actions affected you and how you can work together to rebuild trust.","

I start defending myself bc he’s accused me of cheating on him at this point, asking him what guy and even took a screenshot of my inbox where it said almost 400wks ago on every chat listed, but apparently since it was downloaded a week ago, I’m lying and have a bearded Snapchat emoji boyfriend. 

So he went to bed as soon as he got home tonight, stretched out completely horizontally in the bed and didn’t move an inch when I attempted to get him to move so I could get to bed. I brought the baby’s bassinet to the living room and I’m currently sleeping on the couch with my infant in the bassinet next to me. 

He apologized for assuming, but not for accusing. His exact words were “well… sorry for assuming then” 

He was correct on the “6 chicks and 1 bearded emoji dude” being in my inbox. However, the bearded emoji dude is my cousin who lives 4 states away. 

AITA for not telling him about the reason I downloaded Snapchat right away, and sleeping on the couch because I’m mad he accused me?.

Your response:
","It’s understandable you’re feeling hurt and defensive. You did a quick check on your son’s privacy and didn’t think it mattered, so you didn’t feel the need to explain it immediately. Your husband, on the other hand, saw a familiar nickname and a bearded emoji and jumped to a worst‑case story—especially after a long medical leave and the stress of finances. That accusation feels like a breach of trust, even if it wasn’t intentional.

You aren’t automatically “the asshole,” but the lack of upfront communication left room for misinterpretation. Sleeping on the couch shows you’re upset, but it also signals a breakdown in dialogue. A healthier path would be to sit down, calmly explain why you downloaded Snapchat and what you saw","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

New personal Query: 

Q: Sleeping on the couch after my husband went through my phone because I DOWNLOADED Snapchat  My husband (30m) and I (31f) just had a baby. We’ve been together 3 years. 

I have two teenage boys I took in and later adopted long before ever meeting my husband, 10yrs before ever meeting him to be precise. 

My oldest obtained a phone and has a history of sharing his location through apps. 

I downloaded snapchat after not having it in 6 years to be able to see if my oldest son was sharing his location with the public. 
I used my same login info I had previously used. 
I downloaded it, found my son, ensured location services weren’t active to the public, and closed the app. Didn’t think anything else of it and went about my life and forgot about it. 

My husband and I get into an argument over finances today because I’m going back to work in a week and he doesn’t want to have to put gas in my car for me to transport the baby to the sitter 3 days a week until I get my first paycheck back. So I tell him not to worry about it and I’d figure it out. Exactly like that. 

I’d been on medical leave for 5 months now and have been working from home. Not making a lot, but enough to cover gas and little household things. So when I told him not to worry about it and that I’d figure it out, I figured he’d think I’d do some online work over the next week. But, he didn’t. 

He immediately went to “you going to get money from your boyfriend on Snapchat?” 
Uhm… excuse me? Where did that come from? 
Then he tells me the exact date I downloaded the app and says he saw the snap code when my phone was open, then tells me that “6 chicks and one bearded emoji dude” are in my inbox and that the bearded emoji dude was not my son but was supposedly my Snapchat boyfriend. 

Keep in mind, I haven’t used this app in 6yrs and never fully understood how to use it to begin with. It was one of those download and delete apps for me.

yy377h,AITAH,AITA for starting a screaming match with my husband?,Worldly_Procedure609," I know that the title looks wrong but hear me out. I'm writing this on a burner account because I don't want close friends or family to see this. Anyways, Me, 26 F, my husband 28 M that we'll call T, have been together for 10 years. We broke up a few times through out of our relationship because he was cheating. Yes, I know I went back (which was dumb.) Anyways It all started before our wedding, he had asked me if he could have strippers at his bachelor party. I initially declined because I feel weird about that fact that my soon to be husband was going to see half naked woman the night before our wedding. He ended up getting super mad and started throwing things around the house, he stormed out and ended up coming home around 5 am the next day. In the morning he asked again, I was too scared he would react the same way, so I agreed. I had never seen or felt unsafe around him until that moment. I feel very nervous posting this because I know I will get hate for not leaving, but I was holding on to the boy he was before that moment. The sweet, caring, funny boy I wanted to marry. After his bachelor party, two strippers came home with him. I didn't know how to react, I felt very mad and hurt at the same time. He told me we're all going to have some fun; He was clearly drunk. The strippers brought him to the couch and pulled me into another room and told me he was acting very sexual the whole night. We ended up talking for a while and I even cried to them about how off he was being. They were angels, super sweet. I told them I didn't want to do anything with them, they understood %100. I paid them for their time anyways because I felt bad. I brought my husband up to our room and didn't say one word to him. He didn't even ask me how I was (which is very off because that's usually the first thing he says to me when greeting me, drunk or not.) I've seen him drunk many times, but I've never seen anything like this. He kept going on about how beautiful the girls there were. How their bodies were perfect, how they smelt, and all the things he wanted to them. I left the room feeling sick. I cried for hours and cuddled with my cats, I don't know if I was being dramatic or not still. Fast forward a few months, I had gotten pregnant after a while of us trying But I was labeled ""high risk"". I ended up having a miscarriage at 4 months. I know what you're thinking, my husband probably got very mad. But he didn't, he was very loving and gave me A LOT of attention. I felt as if we were finally okay again. We started going to marriage therapy and were able to talk about the bachelor drama, we both cried a lot. He admitted to feeling VERY depressed and drained with life, that scared me because when we first met, he had very suicidal thoughts. He told me everything in life lost its spark, including our relationship. I didn't know what to say at the time, but he told me after the miscarriage he felt closer to me, his words: ""I was glad we were both sad, we were able to heal each other, and I didn't have to struggle alone."" That concerned me, he felt closer to me because we were both sad? My husband was never a gloomy person up until the whole bachelor thing. I don't know what has changed in him, or what I did.

Now this is where it begins, my husband was great all week up until this moment. I kindly asked my husband if he could change the litter and explained how bad it was for our baby and I's health. He looked at me dead in the eyes and said, ""Your dumb cats, you deal with it."" I was dumbfounded, I can barely bend down with my belly. I just stared at him with a confused face, he told me to ""fuck off, or go change the litter."" I was getting very frustrated because we don't curse at each other. I told him ""Please don't talk to me like that, and all I'm asking for is for you to change the litter it takes 5 seconds."" He slammed his feet to the floor and stood up. He was Cleary just as mad as me now. He started listed the things he does for me, he said ""I work all day, I gave up my office for that baby, I threw away my 20's to be with you."" I was pissed, I don't know if it was my pregnancy hormones, but I snapped. I just started yelling about everything he's put me through. I took it too far by mentioning his mental health, but it had to be said. I told him ""Just because your sad and fucked up doesn't give you the right to treat me like shit."" He started crying and hyperventilating. I told him that I was over his shit and that he either needs to fix his problems or divorce me because I refuse to raise our baby around this. He walked over to me and looked in my eyes. When I tell you my heart stopped. it did, I've never seen this look in his eyes, full of hate and rage. He started yelling about our marriage and then grabbed his jacket. I told him if you leave now don't bother coming back. I should've never said that he just needed air, but I didn't care at the time. He threw a cup and left. I haven't talk to him for 24 hours, I'm seriously considering filing for divorce.

Your response:
","I hear how much pain and confusion you're experiencing. This situation goes far beyond just a fight about cat litter - it seems to be the breaking point after years of concerning behavior, including infidelity, intimidation, and emotional instability from your husband.

Your protective instincts for your unborn child are valid. The fact that you feel unsafe and are questioning whether to stay isn't an overreaction - it's your intuition telling you something important. Your husband has shown patterns of volatile behavior, from throwing things to verbal aggression, that would make anyone feel threatened.

While it's understandable to want to hold onto the ""sweet, caring boy"" you first fell in love with, you have to consider the reality of who he is now and whether that's a healthy environment for you and your baby. The fact that he felt closer to you during shared trauma (the miscarriage) rather than during happy times is concerning.

I would strongly encourage you to:
1. Prioritize your safety and your baby's wellbeing
2. Speak with a counselor independently (not just couples therapy)
3. Consult with a lawyer about your options
4. Build a support network separate from your husband

You're not alone in this, and you deserve to feel safe and respected.","

Your response:
","It takes a lot of courage to share such a personal and painful story. I can sense the depth of your emotions and the complexity of your situation. It's clear that you've been carrying a heavy burden, trying to hold on to the relationship and the man you once knew.

The incident with the strippers at the bachelor party and his behavior that night was a significant red flag. His words and actions have consistently hurt and belittled you, making you feel unimportant and disrespected. The fact that he's now lashing out at you, even in your vulnerable state as a pregnant woman, is concerning.

While it's understandable that you want to protect your unborn child from this toxic environment, it's also essential to acknowledge your own emotional well-being. You deserve to be treated with love, respect, and kindness, especially during this critical time.

Forgiving him might be an option, but it's crucial to consider whether his behavior is a pattern that's unlikely to change. You've already seen glimpses of his darker side, and his response to your concerns about the litter box was alarming.

It might be helpful to take some time to reflect on what you want for yourself and your child. Consider seeking professional counseling or therapy to explore your feelings and options. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but prioritizing your own emotional safety and well-being is essential.","

Fast forward a few months, I had gotten pregnant after a while of us trying But I was labeled ""high risk"". I ended up having a miscarriage at 4 months. I know what you're thinking, my husband probably got very mad. But he didn't, he was very loving and gave me A LOT of attention. I felt as if we were finally okay again. We started going to marriage therapy and were able to talk about the bachelor drama, we both cried a lot. He admitted to feeling VERY depressed and drained with life, that scared me because when we first met, he had very suicidal thoughts. He told me everything in life lost its spark, including our relationship. I didn't know what to say at the time, but he told me after the miscarriage he felt closer to me, his words: ""I was glad we were both sad, we were able to heal each other, and I didn't have to struggle alone."" That concerned me, he felt closer to me because we were both sad? My husband was never a gloomy person up until the whole bachelor thing. I don't know what has changed in him, or what I did. We ended up moving past that, Now, The whole title. I was able to get pregnant again!! I'm 8 months this week. My husband was never a big cat person, he didn't hate them nor was he allergic he just wasn't a big fan. Me on the other hand, I love my babies they're like my children lol. Anyways I've been cleaning their little box my whole pregnancy (which I shouldn't have but I didn't know.) But I'd had read this article about how bad it is for pregnant woman. Now this is where it begins, my husband was great all week up until this moment. I kindly asked my husband if he could change the litter and explained how bad it was for our baby and I's health. He looked at me dead in the eyes and said, ""Your dumb cats, you deal with it."" I was dumbfounded, I can barely bend down with my belly. I just stared at him with a confused face, he told me to ""fuck off, or go change the litter."" I was getting very frustrated because we don't curse at each other. I told him ""Please don't talk to me like that, and all I'm asking for is for you to change the litter it takes 5 seconds."" He slammed his feet to the floor and stood up. He was Cleary just as mad as me now. He started listed the things he does for me, he said ""I work all day, I gave up my office for that baby, I threw away my 20's to be with you."" I was pissed, I don't know if it was my pregnancy hormones, but I snapped. I just started yelling about everything he's put me through. I took it too far by mentioning his mental health, but it had to be said. I told him ""Just because your sad and fucked up doesn't give you the right to treat me like shit."" He started crying and hyperventilating. I told him that I was over his shit and that he either needs to fix his problems or divorce me because I refuse to raise our baby around this. He walked over to me and looked in my eyes. When I tell you my heart stopped. it did, I've never seen this look in his eyes, full of hate and rage. He started yelling about our marriage and then grabbed his jacket. I told him if you leave now don't bother coming back. I should've never said that he just needed air, but I didn't care at the time. He threw a cup and left. I haven't talk to him for 24 hours, I'm seriously considering filing for divorce. I would've taken it back then but now they're kids involved, and I refuse to raise my baby like this. So, am I overacting, or should I forgive him, or do I divorce my best friend of 10 years and raise my baby alone?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve both been on a roller‑coaster, and the last argument feels like the tipping point. Your reaction was fueled by legitimate concerns—your pregnancy, his dismissive tone, and the history of emotional swings. That said, shouting and threatening to leave can spiral into more damage for both of you and the baby. It may help to pause and rest the tempers: a brief break, a calm conversation with a neutral mediator (therapist or trusted friend), or even a short-term separation if you feel unsafe. Consider his reported depression—mental‑health support is crucial for both partners. A divorce isn’t the sole solution; many couples rebuild after a serious fight, especially when a child’s well‑being is at stake. Prioritize open communication, set clear boundaries about respect and safety, and seek professional help to navigate this next chapter.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for starting a screaming match with my husband?   I know that the title looks wrong but hear me out. I'm writing this on a burner account because I don't want close friends or family to see this. Anyways, Me, 26 F, my husband 28 M that we'll call T, have been together for 10 years. We broke up a few times through out of our relationship because he was cheating. Yes, I know I went back (which was dumb.) Anyways It all started before our wedding, he had asked me if he could have strippers at his bachelor party. I initially declined because I feel weird about that fact that my soon to be husband was going to see half naked woman the night before our wedding. He ended up getting super mad and started throwing things around the house, he stormed out and ended up coming home around 5 am the next day. In the morning he asked again, I was too scared he would react the same way, so I agreed. I had never seen or felt unsafe around him until that moment. I feel very nervous posting this because I know I will get hate for not leaving, but I was holding on to the boy he was before that moment. The sweet, caring, funny boy I wanted to marry. After his bachelor party, two strippers came home with him. I didn't know how to react, I felt very mad and hurt at the same time. He told me we're all going to have some fun; He was clearly drunk. The strippers brought him to the couch and pulled me into another room and told me he was acting very sexual the whole night. We ended up talking for a while and I even cried to them about how off he was being. They were angels, super sweet. I told them I didn't want to do anything with them, they understood %100. I paid them for their time anyways because I felt bad. I brought my husband up to our room and didn't say one word to him. He didn't even ask me how I was (which is very off because that's usually the first thing he says to me when greeting me, drunk or not.) I've seen him drunk many times, but I've never seen anything like this. He kept going on about how beautiful the girls there were. How their bodies were perfect, how they smelt, and all the things he wanted to them. I left the room feeling sick. I cried for hours and cuddled with my cats, I don't know if I was being dramatic or not still.

xzeqv1,AITAH,AITAH for snapping at my husband and MIL for horrible comments?,Agreeable-Tiger3963,"TLDR: husband made a grooming comment and abuse joke in front of mother in law who said “ she isn’t deserving of my son” because I’m “ tainted” in the eyes of God. 


I’ve (24F) known my husband (25M) since we were in middle school and I’ve always thought we happy together and in love, you know typical stuff. I’ve always been open about my past and childhood. Part of that was being severely abused by my biological parents and grandmother. I was raised by my grandfather but often my mother or grandmother would watch me while he went to work. My mother was heavily addicted to drugs that she would often use me in any way she could to get money. My father was violent and sometimes crashed with my grandmother ( her and my grandfather were divorced) so in order to keep me from doing things as kids do she would drug me using her medication and if that didn’t work I’d be threatened with severe beatings or actually beaten unconscious. I could never tell anyone about the abuse since I was terrified of what they would do to me and my grandpa. Once I was finally old enough  (14) I was able to make the choice to have zero contact with any of them without the fear.  My grandpa was a good man but he wasn’t the type to show emotion or comfort but the type to “ hide it and deal with it. If not don’t ever tell a soul” so i kept all the trauma to myself. I tried therapy but it didn’t help. Once I started dating my husband I felt all the love and attention I was neglected that I never had as a little girl so I was happy. He never pushed me and always made sure I was comfortable so I tried my best to never be a pain or a burden. 

Yesterday afternoon his mother invited us over for lunch. Usually I do ok with his mother but I’ve been on low contact with her after she threw a passive aggressive fit at me for going on a walk by myself while we were on a family vacation. Well we were talking about a video game where I was talking about how a fatherly character was an asshole for trusting a rat over his own son where my husband laughs and says “ Are you upset about it because another father figure betrayed you?”. I’m all for dark humor and I make plenty of them to cope with trauma but for some reason his comment stung a lot more than I felt it should, especially given I like dark humor.  I kept it together and moved on. Not too long later his mom made a comment about how long we’ve been together and that we’ll make a cute family. ( I can’t have children thanks to bio parents  and husband knows and is ok with it. Not like we can’t adopt ). I smiled and kinda cuddled into him feeling a little socially drained and dozed off a bit still listening. 

“ Well she was easy to train and I’m happy I make her happy” husband says with a laugh almost. 

His mom kinda looks at him weird and asks what he means to which he made he says that I had daddy issues and that he had to basically groom me. 

She proceeds to ask what he means and he goes into the abuse ( all of it not just parts ).

I’ve never told anyone about what I went through because it’s not how I was raised and I didn’t feel comfortable speaking up about it. 

At that point I’m already wide awake and shaking. I felt my heart in my throat and it was taking everything in me not to break down. ( pa didn’t raise a cry baby as he would say ) 

She automatically asks if I’ve been saved by God and a bunch of other bullshit, asking about the abuse and how far it went. So I speak up and tell her that I’m not religious and that I’m perfectly fine. 

At this point I’m getting up and ready to leave to either eat my feelings at Dunkin’ Donuts or go anywhere to just get away.  

Mother in law gives me a glare and tells my husband that Im probably not the right wife since I’ve been tainted in the eyes of God.

 But Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and that’s exactly what I was feeling at that moment. 

Turning around I raised my voice and yelled at  both they had no right to speak of me in the manner they had and that I’m not some damned bitch he could ever tame. I might have trauma and I might be naive but I sure as hell won’t be spoken down to. 
When I reached the door I turned back and said, “Parents tried to raise me as a bitch but they didn’t raise me at all” 

Now I’m getting calls and message from husband begging for forgiveness and apologizing for what he said but I’m scared to talk to him because his grooming comment has me doubting everything about my feelings for him and our marriage. I have a therapy session scheduled next week to hopefully figure this mess out but I just needed to get this off my chest but now I’m feeling guilty and that I might’ve overreacted but I can’t tell if that’s “me” or the victim of me.",68,46,1665297858,"You just scared the hell out of your hubby.

Do what is good for you and what will make you happy.",82,missywitchy1975,"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotions and complex dynamics right now. First, it's important to acknowledge the courage it took to express your feelings and stand up for yourself in a situation that clearly crossed your boundaries. Your past experiences have shaped your resilience, and it's understandable that joking about such sensitive topics, especially in a disparaging way, would be deeply hurtful.

Your husband's comments were not just inappropriate; they were a breach of trust, especially considering how much you've shared with him about your past. It's normal to feel shaken and to question the foundation of your relationship in light of this. Your mother-in-law's reaction only added to the hurt and confusion.

It's good that you've scheduled a therapy session—having professional support can help you process these emotions and decide on the next steps for your relationship. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your well-being and take the time you need to heal and clarify your feelings. You deserve to be treated with respect and understanding, and it's important to communicate your boundaries to your husband moving forward.","

Your response:
","I want to be very clear: you did not overreact. Your husband's comments about ""training"" you and ""grooming"" were deeply inappropriate and concerning, especially given your trauma history. The fact that he shared your private trauma without your consent to his mother, then made light of it, shows a serious lack of respect for your boundaries and emotional wellbeing.

Your mother-in-law's response was also completely unacceptable - traumatized children are never ""tainted,"" and using religion to shame abuse survivors is cruel and wrong.

It's completely understandable that you're now questioning your relationship. Someone who truly loves and respects you would never joke about grooming you or use your trauma against you. The fact that this has triggered doubts about your entire relationship is a valid response to such a betrayal of trust.

I'm glad you're going to therapy to process this. Please know that your anger was justified and your feelings are valid. Take the time you need to think about what you want and what kind of treatment you deserve in a relationship.","

Your response:
","It sounds like a very painful and triggering experience for you. I can sense the hurt and betrayal you felt when your husband shared your traumatic past without your consent, and the way his mother responded was not only insensitive but also judgmental. Your reaction, although intense, seems like a natural response to feeling vulnerable and disrespected.

It's understandable that you're doubting your feelings for your husband and your marriage right now. His comment about ""grooming"" you was particularly disturbing, as it implies a power imbalance in your relationship. I would encourage you to explore these feelings further in your upcoming therapy session. It's essential to process your emotions and consider whether your husband's behavior is a sign of a deeper issue.

Remember that your reaction was not an overreaction; it was a response to feeling belittled and disrespected. You have the right to express your feelings and boundaries, and it's crucial to communicate with your husband about what happened. However, take the time you need to gather your thoughts and emotions before talking to him. Your well-being and emotional safety should be your priority right now.","

My mother was heavily addicted to drugs that she would often use me in any way she could to get money. My father was violent and sometimes crashed with my grandmother ( her and my grandfather were divorced) so in order to keep me from doing things as kids do she would drug me using her medication and if that didn’t work I’d be threatened with severe beatings or actually beaten unconscious. I could never tell anyone about the abuse since I was terrified of what they would do to me and my grandpa. Once I was finally old enough  (14) I was able to make the choice to have zero contact with any of them without the fear.  My grandpa was a good man but he wasn’t the type to show emotion or comfort but the type to “ hide it and deal with it. If not don’t ever tell a soul” so i kept all the trauma to myself. I tried therapy but it didn’t help. Once I started dating my husband I felt all the love and attention I was neglected that I never had as a little girl so I was happy. He never pushed me and always made sure I was comfortable so I tried my best to never be a pain or a burden. 

Yesterday afternoon his mother invited us over for lunch. Usually I do ok with his mother but I’ve been on low contact with her after she threw a passive aggressive fit at me for going on a walk by myself while we were on a family vacation. Well we were talking about a video game where I was talking about how a fatherly character was an asshole for trusting a rat over his own son where my husband laughs and says “ Are you upset about it because another father figure betrayed you?”. I’m all for dark humor and I make plenty of them to cope with trauma but for some reason his comment stung a lot more than I felt it should, especially given I like dark humor.  I kept it together and moved on. Not too long later his mom made a comment about how long we’ve been together and that we’ll make a cute family. ( I can’t have children thanks to bio parents  and husband knows and is ok with it. Not like we can’t adopt ). I smiled and kinda cuddled into him feeling a little socially drained and dozed off a bit still listening. 

“ Well she was easy to train and I’m happy I make her happy” husband says with a laugh almost. 

His mom kinda looks at him weird and asks what he means to which he made he says that I had daddy issues and that he had to basically groom me. 

She proceeds to ask what he means and he goes into the abuse ( all of it not just parts ).

I’ve never told anyone about what I went through because it’s not how I was raised and I didn’t feel comfortable speaking up about it. 

At that point I’m already wide awake and shaking. I felt my heart in my throat and it was taking everything in me not to break down. ( pa didn’t raise a cry baby as he would say ) 

She automatically asks if I’ve been saved by God and a bunch of other bullshit, asking about the abuse and how far it went. So I speak up and tell her that I’m not religious and that I’m perfectly fine. 

At this point I’m getting up and ready to leave to either eat my feelings at Dunkin’ Donuts or go anywhere to just get away.  

Mother in law gives me a glare and tells my husband that Im probably not the right wife since I’ve been tainted in the eyes of God.

 But Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and that’s exactly what I was feeling at that moment. 

Turning around I raised my voice and yelled at  both they had no right to speak of me in the manner they had and that I’m not some damned bitch he could ever tame. I might have trauma and I might be naive but I sure as hell won’t be spoken down to. 
When I reached the door I turned back and said, “Parents tried to raise me as a bitch but they didn’t raise me at all” 

Now I’m getting calls and message from husband begging for forgiveness and apologizing for what he said but I’m scared to talk to him because his grooming comment has me doubting everything about my feelings for him and our marriage. I have a therapy session scheduled next week to hopefully figure this mess out but I just needed to get this off my chest but now I’m feeling guilty and that I might’ve overreacted but I can’t tell if that’s “me” or the victim of me..

Your response:
","It sounds like you were hit with a barrage of hurtful, unscripted accusations that triggered deep‑root pain. Your outburst was a defense mechanism born of years of abuse and gaslighting. That doesn’t make it “over‑reacting”; it’s understandable when you’re fighting to protect yourself from being diminished again.  

Give yourself grace—trauma responses can feel louder than the words spoken. You’re already taking the right steps by scheduling therapy and seeking a calm conversation with your husband. When you do talk to him, focus on how his joke made you feel, not on whether you’re “bad.” Ask for clear boundaries with both of you and with your in‑law.  

Remember: a healthy relationship respects your history and your voice. You deserve that.","

It's understandable that you’d expect some flexibility, given your long-term commitment to each other. 

Have you had a direct conversation with him about how this makes you feel? Sometimes partners might not fully grasp the impact of financial stress unless it’s clearly communicated. Expressing your feelings and discussing how you both envision financial fairness could be crucial. 

It’s also worth considering setting boundaries and expectations together. Maybe there’s a middle ground where he contributes more to shared expenses, alleviating some pressure on you. Relationships are about partnership and understanding, and addressing this issue openly could lead to a more supportive dynamic.","

Your response:
","I sense you're feeling hurt and frustrated by this situation, both financially and emotionally. After 7 years together, it's natural to expect a more supportive partnership, especially when there's such a clear income disparity. The fact that he initially agreed to pay more but then changed his mind when you moved in suggests there might be deeper issues around money and trust that need to be addressed.

While he's not technically obligated to give you money, a healthy long-term relationship usually involves partners supporting each other and working as a team, especially during temporary circumstances like your studies. The 50/50 split despite unequal incomes is creating an unfair burden on you, leaving you unable to meet basic needs like proper clothing.

Consider having an open conversation with him about how this makes you feel and work together to find a more proportional arrangement that feels fair to both of you. Perhaps calculating expenses as a percentage of income rather than a straight split could be more equitable.","

","It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated and unsupported by your boyfriend, especially considering your long history together and the significant difference in your incomes. On one hand, it's understandable that you want to be able to afford some personal expenses and feel like you're being taken care of.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re feeling stuck in a financial imbalance that’s eroding your sense of independence. Your boyfriend’s willingness to “pay a bit more” when you moved in shows he cares, but a 50/50 split—especially when your salary is legally capped—creates a strain that’s hard to ignore. You’re entitled to basic necessities and a little personal budget, and it’s reasonable to ask for support when you’re short.

Try framing the conversation around shared goals rather than a demand: “I’m short on essentials and would love to have a small personal allowance so I can replace worn clothes and keep my budget balanced. Can we set a monthly contribution that feels fair for both of us?” A joint account or a shared spending plan can help both of you see the breakdown. If he","

yphwu0,AITAH,"AITA for hating and shooing away dogs, even if it meant I needed to be a little violent?",ArieCantarella,"I, 18 female originally had no problems with dogs, I didn't like them nor hate them, and I usually tolerated them being around. However, when I was about 14 yo, this all changed. We had a small house that barely fit our family (and that's saying something considering that my family only had 3 members counting myself and my parents). My mother was a dog lover while my father was not. It wasn't that he hated dogs, it was just that he never cared about them and just tolerated them. At first, everything was fine, we had 3 dogs and they were very well taken care of. We placed the dogs near our owned transient house. However, the dogs became a problem for the people renting the transient house. Soon enough, various complaints were released about the dogs, the noise, and everything. It was to the point where it was ruining the business. The place was rated so low, almost nobody wanted to go and rent the place. My father, who was a businessman, immediately noticed the problem and demanded from my mom how she needed to lessen the number of dogs. My mother who absolutely loved the dogs disagreed and said that she wanted to keep them.

It started with simple disagreements, my father convinced my mother to remove the dogs, and my mother disagreed and begged to keep them. But it escalated into arguments, my mother started to argue back and even told my father how he was an apathetic monster for wanting to abandon dogs. Their relationship quickly turned sour, to the point where both of them couldn't even go on for a day without arguing about something. The last straw was when my mother went back home holding a dog, apparently, she pitied the dog and wanted to find a perfect house for the dog. I knew it was a lie, and so did my father. We both knew that she took the dog because she wanted to keep it. She told my father how she wanted to move our other dogs to our house instead, along with the dog she picked up ""while she was waiting for someone to adopt the dog"". My father disagreed because our house was small and the dogs aren't exactly small dogs. This turned into a big argument, it got so bad my mother demanded a divorce from my father. My father who wanted a whole family asked me to give my opinion on it. They explained themselves and why they have the opinions they currently have. I, of course, gave my honest opinion to them and told them that I also believed the dogs were really becoming a problem. My mother was livid, she cried, screamed, and told me how I had no idea how dogs gave light to her life and how I was acting like my father whom she believed was a monster. Since then she started acting cold to me and my dad. She was no longer the same warm and loving mom I grew up with. It affected me really badly, and I started blaming dogs for what happened in my family. I knew I was being petty for hating the creatures who had nothing to do with what happened with my family but I still couldn't help but blame them. I didn't want to see them, and even though my mind knew I was being absolutely ridiculous, I still couldn't help but hate them. So I started shooing them out of my sight and threw rocks whenever I saw one. It wasn't until a friend pointed out how I was being ridiculous for hurting dogs who were doing absolutely nothing to me that I realized what I was doing and made me rethink.

So am I the asshole for hating and shooing away dogs, even if it meant I needed to be a little violent?

PS: I hope I was able to point out the whole event well, English was not my first language so I might have some grammar mistakes.",19,93,1667902880,"Okay... this a LOT to unpack. YTA for hurting innocent dogs that have done nothing to you.  Also for blaming them over something that was the human's fault.  Stop putting your misplaced anger on innocent creatures when you are really angry with your parents. 

You are angry at your parents as well you should be.  They are the true AHs here.  They 1.) should never have placed the dogs at a rental home of course business would go down, 2.) Should have realized they couldn't handle as many dogs as they had and found suitable homes for them,  3.) They should never have let pets come between a marriage and I feel like they are fighting over more than just dogs. 

Your mom is an AH for sneaking an extra dog into the home when there were already problems.  She's also an AH for putting animals above her marriage.  It seems like there must be other problems going on. 

Your parents are also huge AHs for putting you in the middle of their fight and asking you to pick sides.  That isn't something Good parents do no matter how old the kids are.  

I hope you find some sort of resolution but don't be cruel to animals that have nothing to do with this situation.  It's okay to shoo dogs away but don't abuse them don't throw rocks.",83,DeryniMagic38,"YATAH what did those poor dogs do to you???? why wpuld you hurt random animals you found on the street, they werent the ones who hurt your family??? and about the situation at home, I mean i understand the mom completely, I myself am a huge dog lover and i see how it would be a problem for her to give them up. the solution isnt just to give them up tho. maybe if you trained them better, are you sure they had enough exercise?if they are bigger or even medium dogs they should need a lot of walks and stimulation and if they dont get enough they might act out. all in all there was a solution for this FOR SURE and in my opinion ur dad and u were kinda the AH (considering only what i know from this story) and ur mom just wanted to keep her dogs that she loved so much😭",9,fetusdeletus102,"It sounds like you’ve been through a really challenging situation with your family, and it’s understandable that you’re experiencing complex emotions. The conflict between your parents and the subsequent strain on your relationship with your mom must have been incredibly difficult to navigate, especially at a young age. It's important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to feel hurt and confused about what happened.

However, it's crucial to recognize that the dogs themselves are not to blame for the situation. They became a symbol of the conflict, but they didn’t cause it. It’s good that you’ve started to reflect on how your actions towards the dogs might not be the best way to deal with your feelings. Being violent towards animals isn’t a healthy or fair way to express your emotions, and it might be helpful to explore other outlets or talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through.

Remember, healing takes time, and seeking support can be an important step in moving forward.","

My mother was a dog lover while my father was not. It wasn't that he hated dogs, it was just that he never cared about them and just tolerated them. At first, everything was fine, we had 3 dogs and they were very well taken care of. We placed the dogs near our owned transient house. However, the dogs became a problem for the people renting the transient house. Soon enough, various complaints were released about the dogs, the noise, and everything. It was to the point where it was ruining the business. The place was rated so low, almost nobody wanted to go and rent the place. My father, who was a businessman, immediately noticed the problem and demanded from my mom how she needed to lessen the number of dogs. My mother who absolutely loved the dogs disagreed and said that she wanted to keep them.

It started with simple disagreements, my father convinced my mother to remove the dogs, and my mother disagreed and begged to keep them. But it escalated into arguments, my mother started to argue back and even told my father how he was an apathetic monster for wanting to abandon dogs. Their relationship quickly turned sour, to the point where both of them couldn't even go on for a day without arguing about something. The last straw was when my mother went back home holding a dog, apparently, she pitied the dog and wanted to find a perfect house for the dog. I knew it was a lie, and so did my father. We both knew that she took the dog because she wanted to keep it. She told my father how she wanted to move our other dogs to our house instead, along with the dog she picked up ""while she was waiting for someone to adopt the dog"". My father disagreed because our house was small and the dogs aren't exactly small dogs. This turned into a big argument, it got so bad my mother demanded a divorce from my father. My father who wanted a whole family asked me to give my opinion on it. They explained themselves and why they have the opinions they currently have. I, of course, gave my honest opinion to them and told them that I also believed the dogs were really becoming a problem. My mother was livid, she cried, screamed, and told me how I had no idea how dogs gave light to her life and how I was acting like my father whom she believed was a monster. Since then she started acting cold to me and my dad. She was no longer the same warm and loving mom I grew up with. It affected me really badly, and I started blaming dogs for what happened in my family. I knew I was being petty for hating the creatures who had nothing to do with what happened with my family but I still couldn't help but blame them. I didn't want to see them, and even though my mind knew I was being absolutely ridiculous, I still couldn't help but hate them. So I started shooing them out of my sight and threw rocks whenever I saw one. It wasn't until a friend pointed out how I was being ridiculous for hurting dogs who were doing absolutely nothing to me that I realized what I was doing and made me rethink.

So am I the asshole for hating and shooing away dogs, even if it meant I needed to be a little violent?

PS: I hope I was able to point out the whole event well, English was not my first language so I might have some grammar mistakes..

Your response:
","I hear how deeply the conflict over dogs affected your family relationships, especially with your mother. That pain and trauma is very real - watching your parents' marriage strain and feeling your mother's warmth withdraw must have been incredibly difficult at such a young age.

While your feelings of anger and hurt are completely valid, directing violence toward innocent animals isn't a healthy way to process that trauma. The dogs didn't cause your family's problems - they were caught in the middle of a complex situation involving your parents' different values and communication issues.

I'd gently encourage you to:
1. Work through these feelings with a counselor who can help you process the family trauma
2. Find non-violent ways to maintain boundaries with dogs (crossing the street, asking owners to keep distance, etc.)
3. Remember that your worth isn't determined by taking sides in your parents' conflict

You're not an ""asshole"" - you're someone dealing with deep emotional wounds. But you can choose to heal in ways that don't cause harm to others, including animals. Would you be open to talking to someone professionally about this?","

","It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional pain and blame from the experience with your parents and the dogs. It's understandable that you would feel that way, especially since you felt like the dogs contributed to the problems in your family. However, it's great that you're recognizing now that the dogs didn't deserve your anger and that your behavior was unfair to them.

It's not about being an ""asshole"" or not; it's about acknowledging the hurt and frustration that led to your actions and taking steps to move forward. It's clear that you're not proud of how you treated dogs, and you're willing to reflect on your behavior and consider changing it. That takes a lot of courage.

It might be helpful to explore ways to process your emotions and work through the pain from your past. It's possible that talking to a therapist or counselor could help you work through these feelings and develop more positive relationships with animals and the people in your life.","

","It sounds like you’ve been through a lot of hurt and confusion, and it’s understandable that the dogs became a stand‑in for all the pain you felt from your parents’ fight. Lashing out at animals is a natural, but unhealthy, way to cope with those emotions. You’re not the “asshole” for feeling angry, but the violence toward the dogs is a problem, both ethically and legally. It may help to talk to a counselor or therapist about the family dynamics and how they’re shaping your reactions. Working through the hurt that the dogs symbolize could let you find healthier outlets—like volunteering at an animal shelter or practicing grounding exercises—so you can protect yourself without harming innocent creatures. Remember: healing starts when you treat both yourself and others with compassion.","

zuz8hb,AITAH,Broke up with someone over their friend 'testing' loyalty,10KBXTR,"I was told this story might belong here

I (17M) am with my at time Girlfriend, who we will call Sarah (16F) and she's having a sleep over with a few of her girlfriends, one of her friends who was also me ex who she met through me, we will call her Eliza (17F) decides to take it upon herself to conduct a loyalty test, she sends me a message on snapchat asking if i still like her, I say yes but i would never go back to her. I instantly knew this was one of those loyalty tests I've seen on tiktok, i decide to play along and message Sarah saying Eliza is flirting with me, Sarah says idc and stops answering me. This confirms my suspicion of a test, i decide to play along which sounded like a fun idea at the time but i see know it wasn't. Myself and Eliza continue flirting for around half an hour before i say i have work in the morning and im heading to sleep.

Fast forawd two days and i get another snap from Eliza, The image is of her in just some panties standing infront of jer mirror holding one arm to cover  her top half, i ask her wtf is going on and she says she misses me. Me assuming the test was over, say i miss you too, and in full honesty i did miss her a little, she was my first girlfriend, kiss and we both took each others Cards. Eliza goes on saying how much she misses me and that we should hoom back up. Me knowing the pain of cheating which is how we broke up, said no.
She nags me for a while until i say ""Look, i still love you yes, but unlesd you've forgotten we broke up because you cheated, no one deserves that level of pain"" we argue for around 3 minutes before she pulls one of her old moves from when we were dsting and removed her arm from the photo, i go back to message Sarah and tell her but she says oh ik whats happening, sends a photo of her and Eliza sitting together. I try explaining but they wont listen to the reasoning, and start ranting about how im the untrust worthy person and start digging into me about cheating.

To make a long story short i blocked both of them and we broke up, they start posting on instagram about how im the bad guy and turn a good 80% of my friends against me, but am i the A-hole for playing along?",71,39,1671978987,"All of you are the AHs. These loyalty tests are BS.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.",195,Valuable_Ad_742,"It sounds like you're in a really difficult situation, and it's understandable to feel confused and hurt by what happened. From what you've described, it seems like you were caught in a setup that was unfair and manipulative. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, especially when emotions are involved, and it's okay to reflect on how things could have been handled differently.

Playing along with the loyalty test may not have been the best decision, but it also seems like you were put in a challenging position by Eliza and Sarah. It's crucial to communicate openly and honestly in relationships, and it seems like there were some misunderstandings and miscommunications here. Blocking them and moving on might be the best step for your peace of mind right now.

As for the social media fallout, it's tough to deal with, but try to focus on maintaining relationships with those who know the real you and who support you. It might also be helpful to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. Remember, you're not defined by this situation, and you have the opportunity to learn and grow from it.","

Your response:
","I understand this was a difficult and frustrating situation. Playing along with the ""loyalty test"" probably wasn't the wisest choice, even though your intentions were to expose what you suspected was happening. These kinds of manipulative games, often inspired by social media trends, rarely lead to anything positive.

That said, both Sarah and Eliza's behavior was quite problematic. Setting up tests to trap someone shows a fundamental lack of trust and respect. Additionally, Eliza sending inappropriate photos and trying to manipulate you while working with your girlfriend to set you up was especially unethical.

While you could have handled it more directly by immediately calling out the test when you suspected it, their response of turning friends against you and publicly shaming you is disproportionate and unfair. This seems like a valuable lesson in being more direct in relationships and avoiding getting pulled into dramatic games.

Moving forward, I'd suggest being upfront about your boundaries and expectations in relationships, and staying away from people who feel the need to ""test"" their partners' loyalty through deception.","

Your response:
","It seems like you're grappling with whether you made the right decision by playing along with the loyalty test. On one hand, you felt it was a test and decided to play along, thinking it would be harmless. On the other hand, you did end up flirting with Eliza and eventually told her you missed her. However, it's essential to acknowledge that your intention wasn't to cheat, but rather to pass the test. You also set clear boundaries with Eliza when she asked to get back together, citing the pain of her past infidelity.

You might be wondering if you contributed to the outcome, but it's also important to consider the roles Eliza and Sarah played in this situation. They manipulated the situation, and instead of having an open and honest conversation, they chose to create a test and then turned the tables on you.

Their reaction and the subsequent fallout suggest that they might not have been willing to listen to your perspective or acknowledge their part in the situation. It's unfortunate that your friends turned against you, but you can't control how others react. You made the decision to block them and end the relationship, which might be the best outcome given the circumstances.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether you feel like you made the right choice. However, it doesn't seem like you were the sole aggressor in this situation.","

This confirms my suspicion of a test, i decide to play along which sounded like a fun idea at the time but i see know it wasn't. Myself and Eliza continue flirting for around half an hour before i say i have work in the morning and im heading to sleep.

Fast forawd two days and i get another snap from Eliza, The image is of her in just some panties standing infront of jer mirror holding one arm to cover  her top half, i ask her wtf is going on and she says she misses me. Me assuming the test was over, say i miss you too, and in full honesty i did miss her a little, she was my first girlfriend, kiss and we both took each others Cards. Eliza goes on saying how much she misses me and that we should hoom back up. Me knowing the pain of cheating which is how we broke up, said no.
She nags me for a while until i say ""Look, i still love you yes, but unlesd you've forgotten we broke up because you cheated, no one deserves that level of pain"" we argue for around 3 minutes before she pulls one of her old moves from when we were dsting and removed her arm from the photo, i go back to message Sarah and tell her but she says oh ik whats happening, sends a photo of her and Eliza sitting together. I try explaining but they wont listen to the reasoning, and start ranting about how im the untrust worthy person and start digging into me about cheating.

To make a long story short i blocked both of them and we broke up, they start posting on instagram about how im the bad guy and turn a good 80% of my friends against me, but am i the A-hole for playing along?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught in a web of hurt, guilt and miscommunication. On the surface it feels like you were just “playing along” with a TikTok‑style loyalty test, but the fact that you and Eliza actually flirted for half an hour shows that you were willing to blur the lines of your current relationship. That gives Sarah legitimate reason to feel betrayed, especially when she sees photos of you two together.  

You’re not automatically the “bad guy,” but the way you handled the situation—by continuing to flirt and then sending a broken‑up‑ex photo—did give her good reason to feel hurt. The key is whether you’ve tried to genuinely apologize, explain your motives, and respect Sarah’s feelings. If you can do that, the damage may heal; if you simply block and ignore the fallout, the hurt will linger. Consider reaching out calmly, admit the mistake, and let her decide if she wants to talk. It’s a chance to take responsibility and, hopefully, rebuild trust.","

Your response:
","Your response shows maturity and reasonable boundaries. You were incredibly generous to fund her first honeymoon, especially by taking out a loan to do so. There's no obligation to match or exceed previous gifts, particularly for second weddings, and your sister's expectation that you would fund another honeymoon without any prior discussion seems unrealistic and entitled.

Your current financial situation is different, and you still gave them a thoughtful monetary gift they could use however they wished. The fact that she's upset about not receiving an extravagant gift suggests she may have taken your previous generosity for granted.

You're definitely not in the wrong for telling her it's not your problem. Her honeymoon planning and finances are her responsibility, not yours. Perhaps when things calm down, you could have a heart-to-heart conversation about how her reaction made you feel and why you made the gift choices you did. But stand firm in your decision - you made a reasonable and appropriate choice given your circumstances.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and possibly taken advantage of by your sister's expectations. On one hand, it's understandable that you initially went all out for her first wedding, given it was a special occasion and you wanted to be supportive. However, it's also reasonable that your financial situation has changed, and you couldn't afford to replicate that same level of generosity for the second wedding.

It's not your problem that your sister and her partner didn't plan ahead or book a honeymoon. You did offer a thoughtful gift, which they can still use towards a future trip. Your response, while perhaps blunt, seems to be a reflection of your own financial realities and boundaries.","

","It sounds like you’re caught between a sense of duty to your sister and the reality of your current finances. You gave a big gift once, but now you’re only able to offer a modest sum, and your sister feels that you’re abandoning the tradition she expected. You’re also hearing her frustration about “not paying for her second honeymoon.” It’s understandable that you see this as something you can’t afford, yet she may view it as a broken promise.  

Try to re‑frame the conversation: explain your financial limits and emphasize that the money you gave is still intended to help them, even if it’s not a full honeymoon fund. Invite her to talk about a realistic plan together, so the gift feels intentional rather than a dismissal. This approach respects both her feelings and your boundaries.","

z3nd2a,AITAH,AITA/Spoiled or Entitled?,No_Sand_7956,"Do I sound like an absolute spoiled brat? 

Today is my birthday and my parents had asked me specifically what I wanted. I linked my dad to a necklace I really wanted that was around $50.00 USD and I said that that was the only thing I truly wanted. 

My dad’s birthday was two weeks before mine, and I had written him a check to buy whatever he wanted (he is hard to shop for). The check I wrote him was for $250.00 and told him to use it on himself. I gave him more than I usually ever do because I was trying to pay for his gift to me. I know my dad hates spending money so I figured if I included enough money for my gift in his gift, then he could easily get it. 

My family is financially very well to do. When calculated, my parents fall in the category of “more wealthy than 92% of the US population. I would never dare ask them for a gift for $50.00 if I thought my parents were financially struggling. Money, to me, isn’t the issue here. It’s the thoughtfulness. 

ANYHOW, my dad had left his email open on his computer upstairs and I happened to read it (ok I snooped, my bad). He went back and forth with this Etsy seller on the necklace asking for a discount and she wouldn’t budge. 

My dad then makes up a story to me about how hard he tried to order it but the Etsy seller wasn’t shipping it anymore. He was apologetic over and over and I let it go. But when I saw the email and checked the website, I found it was all a lie. 

I opened my gift today and it was a knock off version of the necklace from our local grocery store and it looked nothing like the one I wanted. It said “faith over fear” which is what the necklace I wanted said. But my dad left the price tag on the back that said $40.00. Inside the bag, he forgot to remove the clearance sticker underneath that said the necklace was $12.00. He bragged about how he spent so much on me and I acted elated. I told him I loved it. 

But I am sad. Not at the amount of money spent on me. I don’t care. I’m just sad my dad’s cheapness is so extreme that he can’t even get me something that I really wanted, especially when I had basically given my dad the extra money to do it. I just wanted to know if he would’ve actually done it, but he didn’t. 

My mom got me a t-shirt and hair clips and put stickers that had prices on them that were much higher and very obviously fake to try to prove to me that she spent a lot. 

It bothers me. I don’t need them to ACTUALLY spend anything. But if my dad would’ve actually given ANY thought to me, I would not be so sad. 

Before anyone comments about how they could secretly be struggling — it isn’t true. My parents have been extremely extremely frugal their entire life and have BLOWN up at me when they found out I donated to a charity. 

They NEVER TIP at restaurants, never give a penny to anyone in need, etc. My dad very often pulls up his savings account on his computer to brag about how much is in there. 

It isn’t a money issue. But it’s a thought issue. 

Am I the biggest brat for being upset? 

My dad also “took me out to lunch” for my birthday but made me pay.",81,27,1669305108,"No, you're not spoiled.  

Your parents have an extremely unhealthy relationship with money, though, and what you need to remind yourself is that it's not about you and it is also not about whether or not they love you. Don't take it personally. They're hoarders, except instead of hoarding stuff, they hoard money.

But also don't enable them.  

* Don't give them extra money on their birthdays in the hope that you'll see some kind of return. From now on, if you want something like the necklace you like, just get it for yourself. In fact, I think you need to order that necklace for yourself right now, and you should wear it instead of the one your dad got you. Don't say a word about it, just wear it. He probably won't even notice, and if he does, too bad.
* Don't spend any more time or thought, or money, on the gifts you give them, than they spend on you. Get your dad a $15 Amazon gift card for his next birthday. (It's not about you being petty, it's about you not playing along with their shitty little games). 
* Don't give them the cover of pretending to love the cheap crap they buy you. Thank them politely and let it go at that.
* Don't step up and pay for things when they don't want to.  If your dad asks you out to lunch for your birthday next year, say ""No thanks"". And if he asks why not, tell him that you don't want to get stuck with the check again on your birthday.
* Don't even ask them for gifts.  Seriously.  If they ask you what you want for Christmas or your birthday, tell them you just want cash.",80,Mehitabel9,,0,,"It sounds like you're feeling deeply hurt and disappointed, not because of the monetary value of the gift, but because of the lack of thoughtfulness and honesty from your parents. It's understandable to feel upset when it seems like your feelings and wishes weren't genuinely considered, especially after you made an effort to give your dad a generous gift. Your feelings are valid, and it's not bratty to want to feel appreciated and acknowledged, especially on your birthday.

While your parents' frugality and actions can be frustrating, it might help to focus on open communication. You could try expressing how you feel about the situation, emphasizing that it's not about the money, but about feeling valued and understood. This could open the door to a more honest relationship where your needs and emotions are recognized.

Remember, your feelings matter, and wanting a meaningful connection with your parents doesn't make you spoiled or entitled. It just makes you human.","

Your response:
","Based on the expert dialog example, I'll respond with empathy while addressing the core emotional concern:

You don't sound like a brat at all - I hear genuine hurt in your story, and it's not about the money. It's about feeling valued and seen by your parents. The fact that you went out of your way to make your father's gift generous and thoughtful, while receiving deception and minimal effort in return, would naturally feel painful.

What strikes me most is how you're questioning whether you have the right to feel hurt. The situation with the fake prices and lies about the Etsy seller suggests your parents may have some deep-seated issues with money that go beyond normal frugality. Their reaction to your charitable giving is particularly telling.

You're not entitled for wanting your parents to show thoughtfulness and honesty, especially on your birthday. Those are basic expressions of love and respect that any child would hope for from their parents. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel sad about this situation.","

The fact that your dad went to great lengths to deceive you about the necklace, and your mom tried to create a false impression of the value of her gifts, suggests that they're more focused on appearances than genuine thoughtfulness. 

Your feelings of sadness and disappointment seem to stem from a desire to feel understood and valued by your parents, rather than a sense of entitlement. It's okay to feel hurt and upset by their behavior, and it doesn't make you a brat for acknowledging those feelings.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA/Spoiled or Entitled?  Do I sound like an absolute spoiled brat? 

Today is my birthday and my parents had asked me specifically what I wanted. I linked my dad to a necklace I really wanted that was around $50.00 USD and I said that that was the only thing I truly wanted. 

My dad’s birthday was two weeks before mine, and I had written him a check to buy whatever he wanted (he is hard to shop for). The check I wrote him was for $250.00 and told him to use it on himself. I gave him more than I usually ever do because I was trying to pay for his gift to me. I know my dad hates spending money so I figured if I included enough money for my gift in his gift, then he could easily get it. 

My family is financially very well to do. When calculated, my parents fall in the category of “more wealthy than 92% of the US population. I would never dare ask them for a gift for $50.00 if I thought my parents were financially struggling. Money, to me, isn’t the issue here. It’s the thoughtfulness. 

ANYHOW, my dad had left his email open on his computer upstairs and I happened to read it (ok I snooped, my bad). He went back and forth with this Etsy seller on the necklace asking for a discount and she wouldn’t budge. 

My dad then makes up a story to me about how hard he tried to order it but the Etsy seller wasn’t shipping it anymore. He was apologetic over and over and I let it go. But when I saw the email and checked the website, I found it was all a lie. 

I opened my gift today and it was a knock off version of the necklace from our local grocery store and it looked nothing like the one I wanted. It said “faith over fear” which is what the necklace I wanted said. But my dad left the price tag on the back that said $40.00. Inside the bag, he forgot to remove the clearance sticker underneath that said the necklace was $12.00. He bragged about how he spent so much on me and I acted elated. I told him I loved it. 

But I am sad. Not at the amount of money spent on me. I don’t care. I’m just sad my dad’s cheapness is so extreme that he can’t even get me something that I really wanted, especially when I had basically given my dad the extra money to do it. I just wanted to know if he would’ve actually done it, but he didn’t. 

My mom got me a t-shirt and hair clips and put stickers that had prices on them that were much higher and very obviously fake to try to prove to me that she spent a lot. 

It bothers me. I don’t need them to ACTUALLY spend anything. But if my dad would’ve actually given ANY thought to me, I would not be so sad. 

Before anyone comments about how they could secretly be struggling — it isn’t true. My parents have been extremely extremely frugal their entire life and have BLOWN up at me when they found out I donated to a charity. 

They NEVER TIP at restaurants, never give a penny to anyone in need, etc. My dad very often pulls up his savings account on his computer to brag about how much is in there. 

It isn’t a money issue. But it’s a thought issue. 

Am I the biggest brat for being upset? 

My dad also “took me out to lunch” for my birthday but made me pay..

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between two things: a genuine desire for a specific gift and a sense that your parents are intentionally underwhelm you. That mix of hurt and frustration is understandable, especially when you’ve already given your dad the extra money to make it happen. You’re not automatically a “brat”; you’re feeling disappointed that your expectations—rooted in a particular gift—were met with a cheap substitute. It’s also clear you’re sensitive to how your parents convey care, and the “cheapness” feels like a lack of thought, not just a budgeting decision. A constructive way forward might be to talk to your dad about what a meaningful gift looks like to you—clarifying that it’s not the price but the effort and thought that matters. That conversation can help both of you align on what “thoughtfulness” means in your family.","

It's important to find a balance between advocating for yourself and allowing others some time to adjust. It seems like you care deeply about your relationship with Sam and her family, and you've taken positive steps by apologizing and communicating your feelings. Remember, change takes time, and it might be helpful to continue having open, empathetic conversations with Sam and her family about why your pronouns are important to you. 

It's okay to feel frustrated, but it's also crucial to maintain open lines of communication and patience as everyone adjusts. Keep focusing on the positive progress you've made, and continue to nurture your relationship with Sam.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and hurt you're feeling about not being respected in your identity. Coming out as non-binary was likely a significant and vulnerable step for you. While your emotional reaction is understandable, the way you handled it - leaving without notice and sending confrontational texts - may have created more tension in these relationships.

It sounds like Sam is caught in a difficult position between supporting you and maintaining her relationship with her family. While a month might feel like plenty of time to you, changing long-established patterns of speech can take time for some people, especially older generations. This doesn't excuse their behavior, but it might help to approach this with more patience and open dialogue.

Perhaps you could work with Sam to find constructive ways to help her family understand the importance of using your correct pronouns. This might include having calm conversations about how misgendering impacts you emotionally, or providing resources about non-binary identity. Remember, maintaining relationships often requires finding a balance between standing up for yourself and showing understanding for others' learning process.","

","It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and frustrated by the situation with your girlfriend's parents and the use of your pronouns. On one hand, you're advocating for yourself and setting boundaries, which is important for your well-being. On the other hand, your approach and communication style might have escalated the situation. 

I hear that you feel like your girlfriend and her parents aren't taking your feelings seriously, and that can be invalidating and painful. However, it's also possible that they're genuinely trying to adjust to using your new pronouns, but it's taking them some time.

While this isn't the relationship you wanted with your mother, you're making brave choices to keep yourself safe. Moving away with your grandparents might feel difficult, but sometimes creating physical distance is necessary when someone we love becomes unsafe. Please know that none of this is your fault.

Consider speaking with a counselor or therapist who can help you process these events. They can provide additional support as you navigate this major life change and heal from the trauma you've experienced. Stay close to your supportive grandparents during this transition.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: UPDATE: AITA for telling my mom I don't even want a birthday anymore and going to live with my grandparents for 3months?  So as it is here is the update. A lot has happened since I left my mother's house. For all of you asking yes I have I asked my grandparents to stay with them permanently and of course they said yes. Anyway back to the update. I went over to my mother's house for the last time on Sunday and there I got assaulted by my mother she kept punching and kicking me saying that she didn't want me to leave and that I'm her son and that it wasn't a big deal. Police were called, my mother was arrested and let out on bail. I was working on trying to get a restraining order but the police station I went to said I was too young to have one, so I'm asking my grandparents to get one for me but as they're old they're going to have to have a little time. My stepfather after my mother was arrested showed up at my grandparents house asking to see me as 'he wanted to talk' and 'his kids missed me'. My grandparents decided to give up on renovation after that and just decide to move away and they're taking me with them. It's not a big thing is just things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to. so yeah that's the update!.

Your response:
","It sounds like the situation with your mother has escalated significantly since you last shared about it. I can sense a mix of emotions and a sense of relief that you're now with your grandparents, who seem to be supportive and willing to help you navigate this difficult time.

It's completely understandable that you wouldn't want to celebrate your birthday in the midst of all this turmoil. However, it's also important to acknowledge that your decision to distance yourself from your mother might be a necessary step for your own well-being.

I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share about the assault and subsequent events. It's not easy to talk about such traumatic experiences, and I'm here to listen and offer support.

In terms of your grandparents helping you obtain a restraining order, it's great that they're willing to advocate for you. It's also understandable that they might need some time to navigate the process.

Lastly, it's interesting that you downplay the magnitude of the situation by saying ""things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to."" It might be helpful to acknowledge that this is a significant and life-changing experience, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.","

Your response:
","I hear how hurt and exhausted you are. This situation goes far beyond just a gift - you're carrying an enormous burden alone while your husband seems disconnected from both you and your child. His reaction to basic parenting responsibilities and prioritizing gaming over picking you up from the hospital shows concerning behavior.

You're not wrong for feeling hurt. Your husband's words about regretting the child were cruel, and an apology alone doesn't address the deeper issues. You're working to support the family financially while handling childcare, and it's completely reasonable to expect your partner to participate in caring for their own child.

Rather than silent treatment though, this situation likely needs direct communication, possibly with professional help. It sounds like there may be underlying issues with gaming addiction and avoiding parental responsibility that should be addressed. You deserve a true partner who shares both the joys and responsibilities of parenthood with you.

Would you be open to seeking counseling together to work through these challenges?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling deeply hurt and frustrated by your husband's recent behavior, especially considering the sacrifices you've made for your family. The fact that he didn't help with childcare or even pick you up from the hospital after a difficult delivery is concerning. It's understandable that you're upset about his priorities, especially since you're the primary provider.

Buying a gift for your husband in this situation might not be the first thing on your mind, but it's possible that you're trying to show your care for him despite the tension.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of hurt and feeling unheard, and that’s exhausting. Your husband’s “gaming” schedule has become a proxy for his lack of domestic support, and when you finally asked for help he brushed it off, even suggesting he regrets the child. That’s a painful blow.

You’re not being unreasonable for setting boundaries. A partner who works for the family and takes care of the child should share those responsibilities. The apology he offered is a start, but the silent treatment won’t heal the underlying resentment.

Try a calm, “I feel …” conversation: explain how his comments make you feel and what you need—maybe a set schedule for baby duties or a shared household chore chart. If he resists, consider counseling. The gift isn’t the issue; the real problem is the imbalance of care and respect. You deserve a supportive partnership.","

ulchty,AITAH,AITAH for not eating dinner with my mom on her birthday?,helloo367,"My (16F) mom (40F) got COVID 19 a week prior to her 41st birthday. Now it’s safe to say, I absolutely despise COVID. It’s my greatest fear. I got the vaccine 3 days after it was released to teens. So, when my mom got it, I locked myself in my room refusing to eat or drink. My dad (45M) considered this outrageous, but I didn’t care. Now, three days before her birthday, my dad prepared me by saying I was supposed to eat dinner with my mom, at the same table, with no mask. Now, I wear a mask absolutely everywhere. EVERYWHERE even sometimes in my own house. I know it’s a bit concerning, but I seriously don’t care. I told my father no, I wasn’t going to eat dinner with my mom. He called me a crappy daughter, but I stuck to my morals. On the day of her birthday, I didn’t show in the dining room for dinner. My dad was pissed, and called me a piece of crap daughter. I explained how I was really scared, and he said the lines against me, that I “took care of my boyfriend when he was ill, but I can’t have dinner with my own mom” but, that was different. My boyfriend, Damion (17M) only had a headache, and tested negative 12 times! So, I was okay with taking care of him. Also, my mom had a symptom of a stomachache, and I have emetophobia. My boyfriend didn’t have a stomachache, so I was okay. But now that I think of the incident, I feel super bad. 

Also, since it’s apparently relevant, my mother hates me. She’s an awful mother, and not passionate about raising children whatsoever. I also have an underlying health conditions, leading me to be afraid. According to over 13 doctors, if I get COVID, there’s a 20% chance of hospitalization, and an 8% chance of death.

Your dad's reaction might have felt harsh, and it seems like there's a lack of understanding or communication about your fears and health concerns. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your parents about your anxieties and the reasons behind your decisions, so they can better understand where you’re coming from.

Your response:
","I hear how conflicted you're feeling about this situation. Your fear of COVID isn't just anxiety - it's based on real medical risks given your health conditions. Those statistics from your doctors would make anyone cautious, and it's understandable you're taking serious precautions to protect yourself.

At the same time, I sense some guilt about missing your mom's birthday dinner, even though you mention having a difficult relationship with her. Your dad's reaction seems to have added to these feelings, though his comparison to your boyfriend's situation isn't quite fair given the different circumstances and risk levels involved.

While protecting your health is important and valid, I wonder if there might have been a compromise possible - like having dinner in a well-ventilated space, sitting further apart, or finding another way to celebrate that felt safer to you? That said, you're not wrong for having boundaries around your health and safety, especially with such significant medical risks involved.

This isn't about being an ""awful"" daughter - it's about navigating a complex situation involving health risks, family dynamics, and very real fears.","

Your response:
","You sound like you're carrying a heavy burden, juggling your deep-seated fear of COVID with the pressure of having dinner with your mom on her birthday. On one hand, it's understandable that you prioritized your own health and safety, given the risks you face. However, I can also sense your guilt and regret about not being present for your mom's special day.

It's essential to acknowledge that your fears are valid, especially considering your underlying health conditions. It's not about being a ""crappy daughter"" or not caring about your mom; it's about taking care of yourself and managing your anxiety. That being said, I do wonder if there could have been alternative ways to celebrate your mom's birthday while still maintaining your safety boundaries. Perhaps a compromise, like eating in a separate room or wearing a mask, could have been explored.

In this situation, I wouldn't say you're entirely in the wrong, but it's also important to consider the emotional impact of your actions on your family members. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your dad and mom about your fears and boundaries, and to find ways to navigate these complex emotions together.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITAH for not eating dinner with my mom on her birthday?  My (16F) mom (40F) got COVID 19 a week prior to her 41st birthday. Now it’s safe to say, I absolutely despise COVID. It’s my greatest fear. I got the vaccine 3 days after it was released to teens. So, when my mom got it, I locked myself in my room refusing to eat or drink. My dad (45M) considered this outrageous, but I didn’t care. Now, three days before her birthday, my dad prepared me by saying I was supposed to eat dinner with my mom, at the same table, with no mask. Now, I wear a mask absolutely everywhere. EVERYWHERE even sometimes in my own house. I know it’s a bit concerning, but I seriously don’t care. I told my father no, I wasn’t going to eat dinner with my mom. He called me a crappy daughter, but I stuck to my morals. On the day of her birthday, I didn’t show in the dining room for dinner. My dad was pissed, and called me a piece of crap daughter. I explained how I was really scared, and he said the lines against me, that I “took care of my boyfriend when he was ill, but I can’t have dinner with my own mom” but, that was different. My boyfriend, Damion (17M) only had a headache, and tested negative 12 times! So, I was okay with taking care of him. Also, my mom had a symptom of a stomachache, and I have emetophobia. My boyfriend didn’t have a stomachache, so I was okay. But now that I think of the incident, I feel super bad. 

Also, since it’s apparently relevant, my mother hates me. She’s an awful mother, and not passionate about raising children whatsoever. I also have an underlying health conditions, leading me to be afraid. According to over 13 doctors, if I get COVID, there’s a 20% chance of hospitalization, and an 8% chance of death. 

For me, I refuse to risk it. 
So AITAH?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between a real fear and a family that’s already strained. Your health and the doctors’ warning about a 20 % hospitalization risk are not trivial—especially if you have a serious underlying condition. That’s a legitimate concern, not a “mood.” At the same time, telling your dad he’s a “crappy daughter” and refusing to meet your mom on her birthday can feel hurtful, especially when she already feels distant. You’re not a bad person for protecting yourself, but you might soften the blow by explaining the risk calmly and offering a compromise—perhaps a small, masked visit or a video call. That way you respect your own safety and try to keep the lines of communication open.","

yaldny,AITAH,AITAH For removing my ex when I know she’s in a bad place mentally?,Spood3rm4n,"My ex and I where together for a year. Prior to that we where friends for a year. We broke up at the start of April.

When we broke up we continued to stay on contact until the end of June. She slept with someone else and I mentally wasn’t in a good place to see her with someone new while I wasn’t over her and stopped messaging and responding as much.

Then mid August she reached out. We spoke for a while and both admitted to still having feelings. While my feeling weren’t as strong knowing she still had feelings made me want to try again.

We tried the entire of September and kept having petty arguments over things that we could’ve fixed if we sat down and spoke about them. This sucked as by the end of September my feelings had fully returned for her as I was no longer denying them.

She finally ended fixing things by telling me she had feelings for someone else as well as feelings for me and wasn’t ready to jump into a relationship again and that we should be friends and see what happens.

I did question how being friends and seeing what happens differs from straight up fixing things and she told me that the term fixing things made her feel pressured into a relationship when she isn’t ready.

I said I understood and that while I’m happy to do that if she meets someone else depending on how long it’s been I may need time.

A couple of days later she called me crying. Said she had feelings for the guy she slept with after we broke up and they had been together briefly but it hadn’t worked out as she still has feelings for me. However, she walked in on him in bed with someone else and it hurt her as she didn’t expect that and had been crying since it happened.

Last night we where talking and she mentioned going to a bar with a few friends and family until she posted a photo of her and that guy together with his arm around her and another of them in his house together. It hurt as after what he done she was willing to try with him again or was at least meeting up with him.

I sent her a message saying I wish her the best and that right now while I have feelings for her I cannot be her friend and that I can’t be a shoulder to cry on if this guy does anything bad to her. I removed her off Snapchat but told her if she was ever in trouble she had my phone number and I’d be willing to talk.

Today she messaged calling me an asshole for what I said and that I knew she wasn’t in a good place and they where just friends and I couldn’t be angry over her seeing him as we weren’t together. I tried to explain that due to us agreeing to fix things my feelings for her had came back and while I want to be there for her mentally I couldn’t at this moment.

You owe no further explanations, block and move on with your life.",68,Nixete,"It sounds like you're in a very challenging situation, trying to balance your feelings and the desire to support someone you care about. From what you've shared, it seems you've been quite transparent about your feelings and boundaries, which is important. It's understandable that seeing her with someone else, especially someone who hurt her and indirectly affected you, would be painful. 

You're not an asshole for needing to protect your own mental health. It's crucial to establish boundaries when you're feeling vulnerable. By letting her know that you're there if she truly needs help, you've shown that you still care about her well-being, even if you can't be directly involved right now. 

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your emotional health. Relationships are complex, and sometimes taking a step back is necessary for both parties to heal and grow. You did the right thing by communicating openly, and hopefully, with time, both of you can find clarity and peace in your individual paths.","

Your response:
","Based on the dialog example and the situation described, here's my response:

You're not being an asshole - you're actually making a healthy boundary decision while still showing compassion. You've acknowledged her feelings, maintained an emergency contact option through your phone number, but also recognized that you need to protect your own emotional wellbeing.

It's clear you care about her, which is why this is difficult. However, staying in close contact while she's involved with someone else (whether as friends or more) would likely be damaging for your mental health, especially given your renewed feelings for her.

Her reaction calling you an asshole seems to stem from her own emotional struggles rather than your actions being wrong. You communicated clearly and respectfully about your boundaries while still leaving a door open if she's truly in need of help.

Taking care of yourself isn't being an asshole - it's being responsible with both your emotions and hers by not creating a potentially toxic situation.","

Your response:
","I can understand why you'd feel that way, especially given the emotional rollercoaster you've been on with your ex. It seems like you were genuinely invested in working things out and supporting her, but then you felt hurt and blindsided by her actions and decisions. 

Your message expressing your boundaries and taking a step back doesn't seem unreasonable, especially considering your feelings for her had resurfaced. It's not about being angry over her seeing someone else, but rather about taking care of yourself and your own emotional well-being.

However, it's also possible that your ex feels hurt and abandoned by your decision, especially given her current vulnerable state. It might be helpful to acknowledge that her feelings are valid, even if you can't be the one to support her right now.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re juggling two real concerns: your own emotional limits and her fragile mental state. You did set a boundary—removing her from a platform and saying you can’t be a shoulder right now—because you felt unsafe letting her “hang on” to you while she’s entangled with someone who’s already hurt her. That’s a self‑protective move, not necessarily an asshole act, especially since you left the door open for future help.

wmyp62,AITAH,AITA For not giving her another chance?,DragonHearthIW,"My wife and I have been married for 13 years and have 2 kids a boy and a girl. Our marriage has never been easy and the first 8 years (3 years dating and 5 married) she caught me messaging other girls (Nothing more than flirty texts / no nudes or anything)

But after she almost left me  I realized what I was doing was wrong and she deserved better before our daughter was born and I changed and became a devoted husband and father.

I then caught her sending nudes to some other man, this is when she changed too, she became nasty and vindictive and pretty much treated me like a stranger. She would come home late from work and whenever she got home disappear into the room on her phone.

Fast forward 4/5 years and I catch her again messaging a guy from her office and when I confronted her she told me she wants a divorce and admits to actually sleeping with guy #1, 4 years ago. I'm devastated and crushed for 3 months. I sit in self pity and wallowing, her not listening to any of my pleas.

I found solace in a friend, a girl and she was very sweet and supportive but also not allowing a “relationship” till my divorce was settled.  But my wife noticed I was happier and motivated and decided she now wanted another chance.

I told my wife I’ll give her till September to prove to me I can trust her again and I cut all communication with my friend (Which hurt her very badly and she feels like collateral).

Well folks we’re in August and I found out my wife went out of her way on our daughter's birthday so sleep with an office guy not once but twice in the span of a work day. She was calling him Love and baby in her messages and talking about moving in together.

After more questioning I find a string of guys spanning back the last 4/ 5 years to the first time I caught her.  That she has actually slept with and cannot or will not tell me how many times she's been unfaithful.

Now I am calling for the divorce and she is again begging for another chance   
AITA for not giving her a 4th chance to rip my heart out?

ESH. You suck for flirting with other women while being married or dating. Your wife extremely sucks for sleeping around with numerous men. 

Please, find someone else that can not only love you and only you, but can also help you take care of the kids.  This other person sounds nice, but please do your homework to see if she can last wayyy longer than your previous wife. Divorce and start over.

Etc etc",2,Deep-Chocolate5707,"It sounds like you've been through a lot of emotional turmoil in your marriage. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and betrayed after discovering your wife's repeated infidelities, especially when you've tried to work on the relationship by giving her multiple chances to rebuild trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and repeated breaches can make it incredibly difficult to repair.

It's important to prioritize your well-being and that of your children. You have given your wife several opportunities to change her behavior, but it seems like she hasn't been able to honor the trust you placed in her. Deciding not to give her another chance doesn't make you the antagonist; it reflects your need for a healthy and honest relationship. 

It might be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a counselor as you navigate these difficult emotions and decisions. Remember, taking care of yourself and your children is a priority, and you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected and valued.","

","Your situation sounds incredibly painful, and I hear the hurt and betrayal in your words. No, you're not the wrong one for not giving another chance. While you acknowledge your past mistakes with inappropriate messaging, you showed genuine change and commitment to your family. In contrast, your wife has repeatedly engaged in physical affairs, lied about them, and only seemed interested in reconciliation when she noticed you moving forward.

The pattern you describe - her multiple affairs, the emotional manipulation when caught, and especially the incident during your daughter's birthday - shows a concerning lack of respect for both you and your family. The fact that she can't or won't disclose the full extent of her infidelity suggests there's still no real accountability or remorse.

Moving forward with divorce isn't about being an ""asshole"" - it's about recognizing when a relationship has become irreparably damaged and setting healthy boundaries for yourself. Your children deserve to see a model of self-respect and healthy relationships, even if that means their parents apart rather than together.","

Q: AITA For not giving her another chance?  My wife and I have been married for 13 years and have 2 kids a boy and a girl. Our marriage has never been easy and the first 8 years (3 years dating and 5 married) she caught me messaging other girls (Nothing more than flirty texts / no nudes or anything)

But after she almost left me  I realized what I was doing was wrong and she deserved better before our daughter was born and I changed and became a devoted husband and father.

I then caught her sending nudes to some other man, this is when she changed too, she became nasty and vindictive and pretty much treated me like a stranger. She would come home late from work and whenever she got home disappear into the room on her phone.

Fast forward 4/5 years and I catch her again messaging a guy from her office and when I confronted her she told me she wants a divorce and admits to actually sleeping with guy #1, 4 years ago. I'm devastated and crushed for 3 months. I sit in self pity and wallowing, her not listening to any of my pleas.

","It sounds like you've been through a tremendous amount of pain and betrayal in your marriage. You've given your wife multiple chances to regain your trust, and each time, she's broken that trust in a hurtful way. You've also taken steps to protect yourself and your emotional well-being by distancing yourself from her and seeking support from a friend.

It's understandable that you feel like you can't give her another chance, especially after discovering the extent of her infidelity. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel loved, respected, and valued, and it's clear that your wife's actions have not aligned with those values.

Rather than wondering if you're the ""asshole"" for not giving her another chance, perhaps the question to ask is: What would I be doing to myself if I stayed in this relationship? Would I be prioritizing my own emotional safety and well-being? It sounds like you're taking a difficult but necessary step towards protecting yourself and moving forward.","

","It sounds like you’ve been hurt repeatedly by the same pattern, and the last few months have felt like a crisis of trust. Your wife’s repeated affairs—especially when they’re on the same day as your daughter’s birthday—are not just betrayals of faithfulness, they’re betrayals of the partnership you both vowed to honor. You gave her time, a chance to earn back your trust, and she chose to use that period to deepen the very behaviors that broke it. You’ve also learned that each “second chance” was a temporary fix, not a lasting change. In that context, setting boundaries and moving toward a divorce can be a reasonable step to protect your emotional well‑being and your children’s sense of stability. You’re not being unreasonable; you’re protecting yourself from a pattern that has already resulted in repeated hurt.","

Your response:
","I hear how disturbing and confusing this situation was for you. What your brother did was completely inappropriate and your reaction of feeling upset is absolutely valid. This type of touching without consent, especially from a family member, is not okay and can feel like a violation of trust and personal boundaries.

I'm concerned for your safety and wellbeing. Have you considered talking to a parent, school counselor, or another trusted adult about what happened? They can help provide support and ensure this behavior stops immediately. The smug look he gave suggests this was intentional, which makes it even more concerning.

You did the right thing by clearly telling him to never touch you like that again. That shows strength in establishing your boundaries. However, this isn't something you should have to handle alone. Please reach out for help - there are people who can support you through this and make sure you're safe.

Would you feel comfortable talking to your parents or another adult you trust about this incident?","

The fact that he gave you a smug look suggests that he might have been trying to provoke a reaction from you. It's understandable that you felt shocked and upset, especially since it was such an intimate and personal space that he invaded. 

It's also important to acknowledge that you did set a boundary with him after you calmed down, which is a great step in communicating your feelings. However, it's crucial to consider whether this might be a sign of a larger issue or if it was an isolated incident. You might want to think about having a more in-depth conversation with your brother to understand why he did what he did and to reaffirm your boundaries.","

","It sounds like you felt genuinely violated and that’s a completely valid reaction. Even if it was only a quick touch, you’re entitled to feel safe and respected in your own body. The key is to set a clear boundary—something like, “I’m not comfortable with that touch, please don’t touch my thigh again.” If he still ignores it, involve a parent or guardian so the rule is reinforced. You don’t have to confront him in the heat of the moment; a calm, private conversation can be more effective. Remember, your comfort is the priority, and protecting that boundary is not selfish—it’s healthy.","

stf1pl,AITAH,AITAH for breaking up with my gf over this doubt?,Curiosity19852000,"Ok, so I had been dating this woman for a year and a half. Right before Xmas, she acted as if she wanted to break up (we had a fight, and she askEd for her apartment key back etc.) I then made plans to go overseas with my brother for both Xmas and New Year. This upset her to the point where she went out and met a guy who worked as a DJ at a local bar on New Year’s Eve. They spent a few dates together: dinners, motorcycle riding, and walking on the beach. He’d also been over to her place a few times (she said at one point she was drying her hair after a shower while he sat on her bed.) This dating period happened between New Year’s Eve and about Jan. 15th or so. She and I then made up and she decided not to date him anymore. She told me she didn’t sleep with him while they were “dating” these 2 weeks. Before she broke up with him to see me again, he’d given her a “promise” ring, bought her an engagement ring, which she said she refused to accept, left his motorcycle at her place, and also had attempted to leave his clothes at her place so he could change before going to work (he lives about 25 minutes out of town and works in town.) He’d taken to store her stuff in his storage unit, and from what I gathered, she’d told him a lot about us and our relationship. He professed to love her and wanted to marry her, tomorrow if he could. Here are my questions:

1. Can a guy fall in love with a woman to the point he wants to marry her (I.e. by buying her an engagement ring), even though they have not slept together? Does this sound believable?
2. Does it make sense that a guy who left his motorcycle at her place, wanted to leave clothes so he could change at her place - though they had not slept together or were intimate?
3. Can a guy be that much in love with a woman without having never slept with her?

I have decided we needed a break, and have not spoken to her in a week. All because I keep having this nagging doubt that she is not being truthful to me.

AITA for asking these questions? I know we were apart for 2 weeks, but I’d been burned before when a gf slept with someone else. Am I paranoid? Ladies - does this make sense to you?

To address your questions: While it might seem unusual for someone to fall in love and want to commit deeply without physical intimacy, it’s not impossible. People connect in various ways, and sometimes emotional connections can be very strong. However, your doubts and feelings are valid, especially if you’ve been hurt before.

Taking a break to reflect on your feelings and the relationship might be a healthy decision. It gives you both space to understand what you truly want and need. Communication is key, so when you feel ready, having an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns might help clear the air. Trust is crucial in any relationship, and rebuilding it takes time and effort from both parties. Remember, it's okay to have questions and seek reassurance in your relationship.","

Your response:
","Based on the emotional complexity here, I can understand your doubt and concern. While it's technically possible for someone to fall deeply in love quickly without physical intimacy, the behaviors you describe (leaving personal belongings, proposing marriage, storing her items) typically suggest a more intimate relationship than what she's claiming.

Your gut feeling isn't unreasonable - these are significant red flags that would make most people uncomfortable. The rapid escalation of this other relationship, even if it was during a ""break,"" and the discrepancy between his intense commitment level and their claimed platonic relationship doesn't align with typical dating patterns.

You're not the asshole for having doubts or needing space to process this. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and if you're feeling this level of doubt, taking a break to reflect is healthy. Whether or not anything physical happened, her judgment in allowing this situation to develop so quickly and intensely with another person while you were briefly apart raises valid concerns about her commitment and decision-making.

Instead of focusing on whether they were physically intimate, consider whether you can rebuild trust and if her overall behavior aligns with the kind of relationship you want.","

Q: AITAH for breaking up with my gf over this doubt?  Ok, so I had been dating this woman for a year and a half. Right before Xmas, she acted as if she wanted to break up (we had a fight, and she askEd for her apartment key back etc.) I then made plans to go overseas with my brother for both Xmas and New Year. This upset her to the point where she went out and met a guy who worked as a DJ at a local bar on New Year’s Eve. They spent a few dates together: dinners, motorcycle riding, and walking on the beach. He’d also been over to her place a few times (she said at one point she was drying her hair after a shower while he sat on her bed.) This dating period happened between New Year’s Eve and about Jan. 15th or so. She and I then made up and she decided not to date him anymore. She told me she didn’t sleep with him while they were “dating” these 2 weeks. Before she broke up with him to see me again, he’d given her a “promise” ring, bought her an engagement ring, which she said she refused to accept, left his motorcycle at her place, and also had attempted to leave his clothes at her place so he could change before going to work (he lives about 25 minutes out of town and works in town.) He’d taken to store her stuff in his storage unit, and from what I gathered, she’d told him a lot about us and our relationship. He professed to love her and wanted to marry her, tomorrow if he could. Here are my questions:

1. Can a guy fall in love with a woman to the point he wants to marry her (I.e. by buying her an engagement ring), even though they have not slept together? Does this sound believable?
2. Does it make sense that a guy who left his motorcycle at her place, wanted to leave clothes so he could change at her place - though they had not slept together or were intimate?
3. Can a guy be that much in love with a woman without having never slept with her?

I have decided we needed a break, and have not spoken to her in a week. All because I keep having this nagging doubt that she is not being truthful to me.

AITA for asking these questions? I know we were apart for 2 weeks, but I’d been burned before when a gf slept with someone else. Am I paranoid? Ladies - does this make sense to you? Have you been with a guy whom you’ve never slept with, who wanted to leave his things at your place, wanted to move in, and wanted to marry you - after two weeks of dating? I kept thinking she must have slept with him..

Your response:
","I sense your unease and vulnerability in this situation. It's natural to have doubts, especially given your past experiences. However, it's essential to separate your fears from reality. The questions you're asking are valid, but they might be fueled by your own insecurities. 

Regarding your questions: 

1. It's possible for someone to fall deeply in love with someone without being intimate, but buying an engagement ring after just two weeks might be a red flag, indicating an unhealthy obsession rather than genuine love.

2. Leaving a motorcycle and wanting to leave clothes at her place could be a sign of trying to establish a sense of familiarity or closeness, but it's also possible that he was trying to accelerate the relationship.

3. Yes, it's possible for someone to be deeply invested in a relationship without being intimate. However, the intensity of his feelings, as described, might be unusual.

It's understandable that you're having doubts, but consider whether your concerns are based on facts or your own fears. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend to address your concerns and work through your feelings together. AITAH? Not necessarily, but it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy and an open mind.","

Your response:
","It’s understandable that you’re feeling unsettled. You’ve had a history of being hurt, so the doubt is a natural protective response. The guy’s actions—ring, motorcycle, clothes—do hint at a serious emotional investment, even if they didn’t sleep together. That doesn’t automatically mean he was trying to replace you, but it does suggest he was comfortable enough to share a space and consider a future with her. Asking “Did he really mean it?” isn’t being paranoid; it’s a question of clarity. Before declaring the relationship over, consider a calm conversation where you lay out your concerns and let her explain. If she can’t or won’t address them honestly, you’ve earned the right to step away.","

yclqj7,AITAH,AITAH for telling my mom no,OnlyJordanRemix,"The other day I went out in the garage to say hi to my mom. We spoke for a bit then I went to go back inside.

So, AITAH?",11,82,1666643321,"yes. you were on your feet, and had to walk across the garage (OMG! the ordeal!). She was snuggled in her chair.

It’s understandable to feel conflicted about such interactions, especially when they involve close family members. From what you’ve described, it seems like you were caught off guard by your mom’s request when you were already on your way out. Sometimes, in the moment, we make snap decisions that might not reflect our usual behavior or intentions.

Consider how you feel about the situation now. Do you think your response was more about the principle of the request or the timing? Reflecting on these questions might provide more clarity. If it bothers you, perhaps you could have a conversation with your mom about it. Expressing how you felt at that moment can help both of you understand each other better. It’s not about being a ""jerk"" or not, but about navigating family dynamics and communication with empathy and understanding.","

Your response:
","I sense there might be more to this situation than just the ice pop request. While technically your mom could have easily gotten it herself, your response seems to carry some underlying tension or frustration. Sometimes small interactions like this are symptoms of broader relationship dynamics.

It's worth reflecting on why this particular request bothered you enough to say no, and why your mom's reaction affected you enough to question it afterward. Was it about the ice pop itself, or perhaps about feeling taken for granted or used as a convenience?

While you weren't necessarily wrong to say no, the way we handle small moments of potential connection or kindness with family can impact our relationships. Maybe this could be an opportunity to have an honest conversation with your mom about any underlying feelings on both sides.","

Your response:
","You seem to feel a bit conflicted about your decision, hence asking if you're the 'asshole' in this situation. On one hand, you had already started walking away and felt like you'd made your exit. On the other, your mom asked you for a relatively small favor. I sense that you might be feeling a bit guilty about saying no, especially since you heard her react negatively.

It's worth exploring why you felt the need to say no in that moment. Was it because you genuinely didn't want to go back out, or was it because you felt like you were already done with the interaction and didn't want to extend it? Understanding your motivations might help you feel more confident in your decision, or perhaps it'll give you a chance to reflect on how you could handle similar situations in the future.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you were trying to be polite but also wanted to set a boundary. Your mom’s reaction—scoffing and not being happy—suggests she might have been feeling a little disappointed or annoyed that you didn’t comply. That doesn’t automatically make you an asshole; it just means the interaction didn’t go as smoothly as either of you might have hoped.

Think about the context: were you busy, tired, or maybe feeling that “I’m already halfway through the door” meant you had your own agenda? If you felt it was inconvenient or you just didn’t feel like doing it, it’s okay to say no. On the other hand, a quick, “Sure, I’ll grab it for you in a minute” could have softened the blow and shown willingness to help.

If you’re worried about hurting her feelings, a gentle follow‑up—“I’m sorry I wasn’t able to get it for you right now, but let me do it after I finish this” or “I’m a bit tired, but I can help you next time”—might balance your needs with hers. In short, you’re not an asshole for","

Your response:
","This is a sensitive situation where both parties made inappropriate workplace comments that touched on personal characteristics often tied to racial and ethnic stereotypes. While Rachel's initial question about your hair was inappropriate and based on stereotypical assumptions about Black women, responding with a comment about her nose that played into anti-Semitic tropes escalated the situation rather than addressing the underlying issue.

A more constructive approach would have been to directly explain why the question about your hair was inappropriate and made you uncomfortable. Something like: ""Rachel, I find that question offensive as it makes assumptions about Black women's hair. My hair is natural, but even if it wasn't, commenting on someone's appearance this way isn't appropriate for the workplace.""

Moving forward, I'd recommend:
1. Having a calm discussion with Rachel to clear the air
2. Acknowledging that both comments were hurtful
3. Speaking with HR if needed to help mediate and establish clearer workplace boundaries
4. Using this as a learning opportunity about respecting cultural differences

Remember, responding to inappropriate behavior with similar behavior rarely improves the situation.","

On the last day of work, I came in with my hair straightened. Same color, just flat ironed. Some coworkers asked questions, how long did it take, if I went to a salon, etc. 

Rachel asked me where I bought my hair from. I told her at the same place she bought her nose. Rachel got mad, and said a lot of black women wear wigs/weave, so the question wasn't offensive. I told her a lot of women get nose jobs, so neither was my question. 

Now Rachel is trying to claim I'm anti Semitic, as Jewish people have a history of their noses being mocked. I just answered her question with an equally ridiculous question.

Just so I don't have to repeat the sane answer multiple times: My original clapback to Rachel was going to be asking if her breasts were real. My intent was to show exactly how inappropriate it is to question a person's...""authenticity"" in a public or work setting..

zkq65t,AITAH,AITAH For constantly opening and shutting my car doors early in the morning?,Spood3rm4n,"From the title alone I’d call myself an asshole but I feel background information is necessary to understand where I am coming from.

I (21M) live on a street with a few neighbours and our parking spaces are located at the front doors to our houses in the driveways. My space is technically a public space meaning anyone can park there and there has been a few instances where I’ve had to find another parking space due to people parking there. I don’t mind this, most of the neighbours are nice enough and understand that I normally park there and I’ve even had neighbours knock on my door when their guests are leaving to let me know the space is free.

However, due to this being a public space it’s located in between my house and my next door neighbours house. This neighbour has a habit of complaining over anything, for the past 7 years I’ve lived at that house she’s admitted to my grandmother she’s complained about other neighbours and even tried to complain about our dogs saying they constantly bark at night when they don’t as we wouldn’t be able to sleep if they did.

Anyway back to the main situation. I leave for work at 6:50am. In the autumn months to around 2 weeks ago I only ever opened my drivers door and the boot when preparing to leave in the mornings.

However, due to the ice and waking up to an icy car I’ve had to open more doors. My routine goes as follows: open drivers door, start engine to turn on my heated windscreen, shut drivers door and open the boot to grab my de-icer and shut this again. Then I go about deicing my car. Once this is complete (around 10 minutes later) I open my boot but away my de-icer and scrapper and get into my car and drive away.

Yesterday, my neighbour complained to my gran while I was at work saying I opened and closed my doors too much in the morning and I should be considerate of the neighbours as it has woken her up. My gran did mention the fact that it may not be me as she was never woken by this to which my neighbour confessed she knows it’s me as she watched me one morning after being awoken.

My gran told me to just keep doing what I do but I feel kind of like an asshole if it’s woke her up.

Edit gonna changebthe verdict to: fucked if i know.",8,lemonsneeker,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, trying to balance your morning routine with being a considerate neighbor. It's understandable that you need to get your car ready to go to work, especially in icy conditions, and it seems like you're trying to be as efficient as possible. On the other hand, it's also important to consider how your actions might be affecting those around you.

Perhaps you could try to find a compromise that works for both you and your neighbor. You might consider trying to reduce noise by closing your car doors more gently or starting your car a little later if possible. You could also have a conversation with your neighbor to explain your situation and see if there's a way to address her concerns together.

Ultimately, it doesn't seem like you're intentionally being inconsiderate, and your willingness to reflect on the situation shows that you're mindful of your neighbors. Finding a balance that works for everyone might help ease any tension and maintain good neighborly relations.","

Your response:
","Based on the dialog example, I'll respond with empathy while addressing the practical situation:

It sounds like you're feeling conflicted about this - trying to balance being considerate to your neighbors while also just doing what's necessary to safely prepare your car for work in the morning. The fact that you're concerned about potentially disturbing others suggests you're thoughtful about your impact on those around you.

That said, what you're describing is a normal, reasonable morning routine for dealing with a car in winter conditions. You're not slamming doors unnecessarily or making excessive noise - you're simply taking the required steps to safely drive to work. While your neighbor's sleep is important, 6:50 AM is a standard time for people to be leaving for work, and normal car sounds are part of living in a residential area.

Perhaps you could try to close the doors as quietly as possible, but you shouldn't feel guilty about taking care of your car and getting to work safely. This seems more like your neighbor's pattern of complaints rather than truly inconsiderate behavior on your part.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're genuinely concerned about being considerate of your neighbor's needs, but at the same time, you feel your actions are reasonable given the circumstances. You're not intentionally trying to disturb her, but rather, you're trying to prepare your car for the cold weather. 

It's also worth noting that your neighbor has a history of complaining about minor issues, which might suggest that she's more sensitive to noise than others. It's possible that she's being more bothered by the noise than she needs to be. 

I'd say you're not entirely the asshole in this situation. You're just trying to get to work, and your actions seem reasonable. However, you could consider being more mindful of the noise in the future, perhaps by trying to minimize the number of times you open and close your doors. But it's also important not to let your neighbor's complaints dictate your actions too much, especially if you feel you're being reasonable.","

","It sounds like you’re in a tough spot—trying to get your car ready in the cold while your neighbour’s alarm clock is on the back burner. You’re not “just” being a nuisance; you’re dealing with a public parking spot and a neighbor who’s already on edge. The fact that she heard you and said it woke her up is a concrete sign that your routine is having an impact. 

You could keep doing what you need to do, but a small tweak could ease the tension: try to finish de‑icing and get into the car faster, or, if possible, park a few feet back in the drive (even if that means a bit of walking). A quick, polite note to the neighbour—“I’m sorry if the door noise woke you; I’ll try to be quicker”—shows you respect her space without giving up what you need. Most people appreciate a little courtesy, and you’ll get to keep your routine with less friction.","

Some places have a minimum amount required, meaning that OP would then have to spend some of it to get it to the desired amount.

It might be more constructive to have an open and honest conversation with your sister about how her actions have affected you. This could provide an opportunity for both of you to express your feelings and potentially find a path forward.

Your response:
","I can sense you're feeling hurt and betrayed, not just about the unpaid loan but the deeper issues with your sister's dishonesty and its impact on your family relationships. While sending a nearly empty gift card might feel satisfying as payback, it's likely to escalate tensions and cause more damage to your relationship.

Instead of acting on these understandable feelings of frustration, perhaps consider either having an honest conversation with your sister about how her actions have affected you, or making peace with writing off the loan for your own mental well-being. The $200 loss is painful, but letting resentment guide your actions might cost you more in the long run.

Have you considered setting clear boundaries with your sister going forward while processing your hurt in a way that doesn't compromise your own values?","

","It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of hurt and frustration—your sister’s promises have gone unkept, she’s asked you to keep secrets, and her lies have even strained your family’s relationships. Wanting to give a small gift (even just $0.12) can feel like a way to soften that tension, but it might also feel like a gesture of goodwill that isn’t reciprocated.

You might consider using that tiny amount for something that supports you instead—perhaps a coffee, a book, or a small treat for yourself. If you still want to acknowledge her, a brief, honest conversation about the debt and your expectations could set clearer boundaries. Honesty and self‑care can help you navigate the mix of caring and frustration you’re experiencing.","

zpwr84,AITAH,AITA if I break up with my boyfriend?,Firm_Assignment_4173,"I (19F ) started dating my Boyfriend (22M) 11 months ago, roughly 7 months into our relationship he asked if we could do a hookup agreement where we both sleep with one person and then lose contact and go back to our relationship. Even though I didn't want to I agreed, I ended up having mine about a month later and he still has not had his. I started to get uncomfortable and asked him if he would consider not hooking up with someone because seeing him talk to these other girls made me sad, to which he responded ""it's only fair since you got to so I'm doing rather you want me to or not"". Over the last few days, I've noticed him texting a girl and smiling, I'm aware it's wrong but I went through his phone to see their texts which consisted of them telling each other how much they like one another, calling each other pet names, sending kissy faces and heart emojis, and talking shit about me. He also told her that he wanted to be friends with benefits even though our agreement said it would be one-and-done. They also had an actual date planned to go see Christmas lights, the one date I've asked him to take me on since we started talking in January. He has also been caught going through my phone multiple times since the begging of our relationship and I've never been rude to him about it, but once he found out what I did he got upset.

It's clear that you value honesty and trust in a relationship, and it's concerning that your boyfriend hasn't been upfront with you about his interactions with this other person. Emotional cheating can be just as painful as physical cheating, and your feelings are valid.

It's important to prioritize your well-being and happiness. If this relationship is causing you distress and you feel like your boundaries and feelings are not being respected, it's okay to consider ending it. A healthy relationship should be based on mutual respect, trust, and open communication. If your boyfriend is unwilling to address these issues or make changes, breaking up might be the best option for you to find peace and move forward.

Remember, you deserve to be in a relationship where your feelings are valued and respected. Trust your instincts and do what's best for you.","

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA if I break up with my boyfriend?  I (19F ) started dating my Boyfriend (22M) 11 months ago, roughly 7 months into our relationship he asked if we could do a hookup agreement where we both sleep with one person and then lose contact and go back to our relationship. Even though I didn't want to I agreed, I ended up having mine about a month later and he still has not had his. I started to get uncomfortable and asked him if he would consider not hooking up with someone because seeing him talk to these other girls made me sad, to which he responded ""it's only fair since you got to so I'm doing rather you want me to or not"". Over the last few days, I've noticed him texting a girl and smiling, I'm aware it's wrong but I went through his phone to see their texts which consisted of them telling each other how much they like one another, calling each other pet names, sending kissy faces and heart emojis, and talking shit about me. He also told her that he wanted to be friends with benefits even though our agreement said it would be one-and-done. They also had an actual date planned to go see Christmas lights, the one date I've asked him to take me on since we started talking in January. He has also been caught going through my phone multiple times since the begging of our relationship and I've never been rude to him about it, but once he found out what I did he got upset. When I brought it up to him he was very dismissive, and didn't apologize or really say anything other than he didn't want to break up and that I have trust issues for going through his texts. I am aware of my role in what happened but what he's doing feels like emotional cheating and it really hurts. Would I be the asshole if a broke up with him over it?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you're really hurting and questioning yourself, even though your boyfriend's behavior has clearly crossed boundaries. No, you would not be the asshole for breaking up with him. While the initial hookup agreement was consensual, he's now using it to justify emotional cheating and disrespecting your feelings.

Several red flags stand out:
- He's dismissing your valid concerns
- He's planning romantic dates with another person
- He's talking negatively about you to others
- He's applying double standards about phone privacy
- He's changing the terms of your agreement without consent

Your discomfort and hurt feelings are completely valid. A healthy relationship requires mutual respect, honest communication, and consideration for each other's feelings - none of which seem present in his current behavior. You deserve a partner who values your feelings and respects agreed-upon boundaries. Breaking up would be a reasonable response to protect your emotional wellbeing.","

Your response:
","It seems like you're feeling deeply hurt and betrayed in this situation. On one hand, you acknowledge going through his phone was wrong, but on the other, you feel like his actions are a form of emotional cheating that's causing you significant pain. It's understandable that you'd feel this way, especially given the fact that he's been dismissive of your feelings and hasn't taken responsibility for his actions. 

It's also worth noting that you felt pressured into agreeing to the hookup arrangement initially, and now it seems like he's not respecting the boundaries you both set. Breaking up with him might be a difficult but necessary step for you to take care of yourself and prioritize your emotional well-being. It's not necessarily about being the ""asshole"" or not – it's about recognizing what you deserve in a relationship and making a decision that aligns with your values and feelings.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy mix of hurt, betrayal, and fear. You’re not simply “breaking up” because you’re upset; you’re trying to protect the sense of safety and respect you deserve. The hookup pact was a mutual agreement, but one of you clearly didn’t honor it—he’s moving on with someone else while you’re still holding onto the promise that was made. When he dismissed your feelings and blamed you for “trust issues,” it shifted the focus away from his actions. That’s a big red flag for trust. You deserve a partner who listens to your concerns, respects boundaries, and keeps his promises. If he can’t do that, ending the relationship is not being an asshole—it’s standing up for your own emotional well‑being.","

Your response:
","I understand you were trying to protect the dog from abuse, which shows you care about preventing harm. However, responding with physical violence, even when witnessing something upsetting, isn't the right approach and could escalate the situation dangerously.

It sounds like there were multiple concerning behaviors happening - the inappropriate comments around children, drug use with minors present, and animal abuse. Your cousin's actions toward the dog were absolutely wrong, but hitting her created additional problems rather than solving anything.

The better course would have been to:
1. Remove the dog from the situation
2. Document the abuse
3. Report it to proper authorities
4. Leave the unsafe environment

You're not wrong for wanting to protect a vulnerable animal, but there are more effective ways to handle it than physical confrontation. Consider reporting the animal abuse through proper channels and avoiding situations with this cousin until she gets help for her concerning behaviors.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you were in a challenging and emotional situation, and you're questioning your actions. On one hand, you were trying to protect the dog from being harmed, which shows that you care about animal welfare. On the other hand, you physically hit your cousin, which is a complex issue.

It's understandable that you would feel upset and want to intervene when you saw the dog being kicked. However, it's also important to consider whether physical violence was the most effective way to resolve the situation. It's clear that you were trying to protect the dog, but it's also possible that there were other ways to address the situation without resorting to physical violence.

It's worth exploring why you felt like physical violence was the only option in that moment. Was it a reaction to the stress and tension of the situation, or was it a deeper-seated issue? It might be helpful to reflect on your actions and consider whether there are other ways to manage conflict and protect those you care about in the future.

As for whether you're the ""asshole"" in this situation, it's not necessarily about assigning blame or labels. It's more about acknowledging that the situation was complex and that you made a choice in a moment of high emotion. If you're feeling unsure about your actions, it might be helpful to talk to someone you trust about what happened and how you're feeling.","

Your response:
","I hear you’re in a painful spot—your cousin’s statements and her reaction with the dog felt like a personal affront, and you felt your frustration boiling over. It sounds like you were already under pressure: a relaxed day turned tense, the kids were watching, and you probably felt your boundaries being crossed. Still, smacking her and then hitting her again with a flip‑flop is an escalation that can have legal and relational fallout. Even if you’re upset, physical violence rarely solves the underlying conflict and can damage family ties and your own reputation. Instead, consider calling your grandfather, reaching out to the police for a calm mediation, or contacting animal‑protection services if the dog’s safety is at risk. Moving forward, setting clear limits and using non‑violent communication can help protect everyone—especially the kids and the dog.","

z97ym8,AITAH,"AITA for ""making things about myself"" and calling out those saying that?",UshouldBlaughin6,"I’m 25F and newly married to my equally baffled husband (27M). My family and friends know I use this sub and ask me “what I’ve seen” all the time. They love this stuff, so this is kinda surreal.

The  crazy stuff started at the rehearsal dinner a few weeks ago, which my  Maid of Honor decided was the perfect time to announce that she was  pregnant with twins. I told her “This is our occasion, please don’t  steal from us” and she insisted anyway, since not everything has to  revolve around me, and at least she did it at the rehearsal and not the reception. Turns out that she’s just pregnant with one baby and that the twins thing was a lie, probably to garner attention. After silently  loathing her all of my wedding day, I’m not speaking to her.

It got even worse at my wedding. For the unaware, it’s customary after the couple’s first dance for a bride + her father and a groom + his mother to dance. Well right after this, my MIL of all people did a  gender-reversal proposal to her boyfriend of 1 year (my hubby’s father  died in an accident 4 years ago) with everybody watching. Someone took a picture of my livid face and my husband's panic. He told me later he didn’t like this either, and it makes no sense to either of us since  she’s very conservative.

Thanksgiving at my in-laws was very hostile. It felt like when I wanted to join a conversation, it would shift subjects, and they were dismissive of everything I said, even about my own honeymoon which I'd just gotten back from. I felt unwelcome. Husband told me MIL said it was because I  was wearing a hat, but I know that’s an excuse. I texted her because of this (bad hair days happen!) and what happened at the wedding, I have no intention of having any relationship with her.

A  fourth incident occurred the other day, when my single mother cousin, who was a bridesmaid too, was at my door without warning asking if my husband and I could watch the kid. We’re not equipped to do that and she didn’t provide us with a changing table or anything, and we had work to do (I work from home, my husband works a 1 to 9 shift), so we said no. This made her mad. She posted to Snap that “Some people really should be  better friends” and at that point, I’d had enough.

I replied to her “Well if YOU asked ahead of time, and YOU had given us  the equipment, maybe YOU would be a better friend.” She sent a series of  vicious messages, followed by other cousins and friends trashing me  just the same. I got called out for being “a cold b\*\*\*h” for making  literally everything about me. I posted to Facebook, what my older relatives and in-laws use, “Literally ALL of these incidents happen in AITA posts. WHY ARE YOU ALL CONSPIRING AGAINST ME? You’re all awful! Is this why you keep asking what happens there?” This of course got me more replies saying that I only ever think about myself, including MIL calling me a b\*\*\*h too, and a bunch of denials. I can’t help but think me making all of these incidents about me as the common denominator. AITA?",32,52,1669853014,"I dunno, after reading your other post and now this one, it seems like a lot of people are having conflict with you. Are all these other people really the problem, or are you doing a little more than your saying to feed the conflict?",8,RandomName78A, Not creative writing?,5,Imaginary-Yak-6487,"It sounds like you've been through a series of challenging and emotionally charged situations, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed and targeted. It seems like you're experiencing a lot of tension with your family and friends, and these incidents have made you feel isolated and misunderstood.

From what you've described, it's clear that you value your relationships and care about how you're perceived by those close to you. It's possible that the emotions surrounding your wedding and the other events have heightened everyone's sensitivity, leading to misunderstandings.

It might be helpful to take a step back and consider having open, honest conversations with those involved, when you feel ready. Express how their actions made you feel without assigning blame, and try to understand their perspectives as well. This could help clear the air and rebuild some of those strained relationships.

Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and communicate your needs, but also be open to listening and understanding others' viewpoints. Finding common ground and expressing empathy can often help mend fractured relationships.","

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for ""making things about myself"" and calling out those saying that?  I’m 25F and newly married to my equally baffled husband (27M). My family and friends know I use this sub and ask me “what I’ve seen” all the time. They love this stuff, so this is kinda surreal.

The  crazy stuff started at the rehearsal dinner a few weeks ago, which my  Maid of Honor decided was the perfect time to announce that she was  pregnant with twins. I told her “This is our occasion, please don’t  steal from us” and she insisted anyway, since not everything has to  revolve around me, and at least she did it at the rehearsal and not the reception. Turns out that she’s just pregnant with one baby and that the twins thing was a lie, probably to garner attention. After silently  loathing her all of my wedding day, I’m not speaking to her.

It got even worse at my wedding. For the unaware, it’s customary after the couple’s first dance for a bride + her father and a groom + his mother to dance. Well right after this, my MIL of all people did a  gender-reversal proposal to her boyfriend of 1 year (my hubby’s father  died in an accident 4 years ago) with everybody watching. Someone took a picture of my livid face and my husband's panic. He told me later he didn’t like this either, and it makes no sense to either of us since  she’s very conservative.

Thanksgiving at my in-laws was very hostile. It felt like when I wanted to join a conversation, it would shift subjects, and they were dismissive of everything I said, even about my own honeymoon which I'd just gotten back from. I felt unwelcome. Husband told me MIL said it was because I  was wearing a hat, but I know that’s an excuse. I texted her because of this (bad hair days happen!) and what happened at the wedding, I have no intention of having any relationship with her.

A  fourth incident occurred the other day, when my single mother cousin, who was a bridesmaid too, was at my door without warning asking if my husband and I could watch the kid. We’re not equipped to do that and she didn’t provide us with a changing table or anything, and we had work to do (I work from home, my husband works a 1 to 9 shift), so we said no. This made her mad. She posted to Snap that “Some people really should be  better friends” and at that point, I’d had enough.

I replied to her “Well if YOU asked ahead of time, and YOU had given us  the equipment, maybe YOU would be a better friend.” She sent a series of  vicious messages, followed by other cousins and friends trashing me  just the same. I got called out for being “a cold b\*\*\*h” for making  literally everything about me. I posted to Facebook, what my older relatives and in-laws use, “Literally ALL of these incidents happen in AITA posts. WHY ARE YOU ALL CONSPIRING AGAINST ME? You’re all awful! Is this why you keep asking what happens there?” This of course got me more replies saying that I only ever think about myself, including MIL calling me a b\*\*\*h too, and a bunch of denials. I can’t help but think me making all of these incidents about me as the common denominator. AITA?.

Your response:
","Let me reflect what I'm hearing in your situation. You're feeling hurt, frustrated, and possibly gaslit by a series of events where you believe others have acted inappropriately during important moments in your life. The pregnancy announcement at your rehearsal dinner, the surprise proposal at your wedding, the cold treatment at Thanksgiving, and the unexpected childcare request - all these situations have left you feeling disrespected and invalidated.

When you tried to stand up for yourself, you were labeled as self-centered, which seems to have made you question whether you're actually being unreasonable. It's natural to feel defensive when multiple people seem to be crossing boundaries during what should be special occasions for you.

However, posting publicly about these conflicts may have escalated tensions rather than resolved them. While your feelings are valid, it might be worth considering having private conversations with each person to understand their perspectives and share yours calmly. Your husband's support is important here - perhaps you two can work together to establish healthy boundaries with family while maintaining relationships.

Would you be open to discussing how to address these situations in a way that both honors your feelings and keeps communication channels open?","

Your response:
","I sense that you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the series of events that have unfolded. It seems like you're struggling to understand why others are not respecting your boundaries or considering your feelings. I want to acknowledge that it's understandable to feel that way, especially when it comes to significant life events like your wedding and honeymoon.

However, I also notice that you seem to be perceiving these incidents as a personal attack or a conspiracy against you. While it's possible that some individuals may be seeking attention or trying to upstage you, it's also possible that they're simply not considering your feelings or boundaries.

Rather than focusing on whether others are ""conspiring against you,"" it might be helpful to explore why you feel the need to make these incidents about yourself. Is it because you feel like you're not being heard or validated? Are there underlying insecurities or fears that are driving your reactions? By examining your own emotions and motivations, you may gain a deeper understanding of why these incidents are affecting you so deeply.

It's also worth considering the impact of your reactions on others. While you may feel justified in calling out your friends and family members, it's possible that your approach is coming across as defensive or confrontational. This may be contributing to the negative reactions you're receiving.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re feeling invisible, blindsided, and defensive—all of which are totally understandable after a string of rude surprises and public embarrassments. The “I’m the victim” framing comes from a place of hurt, not from a deliberate attempt to shift blame. You’re reacting to real, repeated disrespect, and when people start calling you a “cold b****” it can feel like a personal attack on your whole identity.

That said, the way you communicate—flooding the family group, publicly calling people “conspiring”—can reinforce the narrative that you’re the problem. It’s easy for others to swing the blame back at you when you “make everything about yourself.” Try to pause, write a private note to each person (or your husband) outlining one specific incident, how it made you feel, and what you’d like differently next time. Keep it factual, not accusatory. This shows you’re willing to listen and change, even while protecting your boundaries. It’s a small step that can break","

"
yrw9y2,AITAH,AITA for not entirely cutting ties with people who screwed over my significant other?,assleypatterson,"Okay so this is kinda a long story and i hope i can explain it in a way that makes sense.

So me(26F) and my significant other(24M) moved to Michigan together last year (June 2021) and we were living with his friends family. We were going through some issues and my significant other ended up moving out quite a bit before me. This family we were living with 2 women (35 and 50) and their daughter (18) really hit it off with me and kind of became like my family. They were there for me, even when my significant other was not and i had nobody else in this state.

Fast forward to March 2022 and me and my significant other are good again, he is on bipolar meds and things are looking up. we take a weekend trip to chicago with some friends from our hometown. While we were gone my significant other gave the family a key to his apartment so they could bring in his hello fresh order for him. Once we got back it was disclosed to me that while we were gone, the 50F son(21M) aka the friend of my significant other used his key to go into his apartment, eat his food, go through his things, and have sex with someone in his bed. super fucked up. they told me about it and were not going to tell my significant other so i told them straight up that i thought that was fucked up and i was gonna tell him, so i did. he tried to address it with every member of the family and they all dismissed him and acted like he was making a big deal out of nothing. My significant other retaliated by reporting his friend for something and getting him in some pretty big trouble. Needless to say, my significant other and that family no longer have a relationship but I was still living with them.

I moved out into my own apartment in June of 2022 and i havent really seen or spoken to that family since despite them wanting to see me and us making plans a couple of times and them getting cancelled for whatever reason. I am on my sig others side and have kept my distance. But every friday night my sig other has been playing DnD with his friends and i have class early on saturday so i do not join. This family invited me to come over for pizza this Friday (tomorrow) and i told them sure but i wont stay long because i have to study for my exam saturday. I told my sig other about it and he is pretty upset and says he feels betrayed that i am still willing to see them and speak with them and i have tried to explain that their beef really doesnt involve me, but he disagrees. I dont think it is betrayal because my relationship with them is just different and they never wronged me. He wants me to cancel but it makes me feel bad because i already said yes and what not so i just need to know...AITA in this situation and i SHOULD cancel/cut them out of my life?

I feeel like i also should mention that me and my significant other are actually legally married, we just don't have a conventional relationship because we had some issues we needed to work through and what not.",40,44,1668126067,"Ytah- one why would you still want to be around people that have disrespected your significant other, honestly makes no sense to me. He trusted them enough to give the person keys to their home and basically got slapped in the face and gaslighted. 
And here you are making plans with said people? 

You and your husband are a union, So boundaries should be set in place to have some sort of respect for your husband.",43,ssmc2001,"After thinking about this a little longer I think You ath for not clearly seeing your husband is being a total AH here. This was such a good friend his family let him and you stay with them for 2 years. His friend goes into his apartment and has sex in his bed and eats some food when he’s not there. His family asks you not to tell probably because they were afraid he would overreact because he’s bipolar, which he did. In retaliation your husband gets his friend into some really big trouble. If my good friend, who I gave the keys to my apartment to get some packages for me, went into my apartment had sex and ate some food I wouldn’t mess up his life like that. Did he wash the sheets? I would want them to tell me sure but its not that huge of a deal to do that to my friend. After this you stay with the family with his permission. Now he is accusing you of betraying him? It doesn’t sound like you have issues with betrayal its him. This doesn’t even involve his friend’s family, who have been like a second family to you and that is who your visiting. Your husband is tah.",-1,Embarrassed_Lion4433,"It sounds like you’re in a tough spot, caught between your significant other and a family that became a support system for you during a challenging time. It’s understandable that your significant other feels hurt and betrayed by their actions, given the serious breach of trust. His feelings might make it difficult for him to understand why you would want to maintain a relationship with them.

However, it also seems like your bond with this family is separate from the issues between them and your significant other. It’s important to acknowledge your partner’s feelings while also considering your own. You’ve been clear about your stance by keeping your distance and communicating openly with your significant other.

Perhaps it would help to have a candid conversation with him about why this connection is meaningful to you, emphasizing that it doesn’t detract from your loyalty to him. It might also be worth discussing boundaries and finding a compromise that respects both your partner’s feelings and your own needs. Balancing relationships can be tricky, but open communication is key.","

Your response:
","Let me reflect what I'm hearing: You're caught between loyalty to your husband and maintaining relationships with people who supported you during a difficult time. While they seriously violated your husband's trust and privacy, they were like family to you when you felt alone. This is creating real tension in your marriage.

It's understandable why your husband feels betrayed - from his perspective, these people disrespected his home and privacy in an extreme way, then dismissed his valid concerns. By maintaining a relationship with them, he may feel you're minimizing how deeply they hurt him.

While they didn't wrong you directly, they did wrong your life partner in a significant way. In a marriage, your partner's deep hurts often need to be treated as shared hurts. Consider how you would feel if the situation was reversed.

This isn't about choosing sides between right and wrong - it's about prioritizing your marriage and your husband's wellbeing. Perhaps it would be worth having an honest conversation with your husband about how to handle this situation in a way that acknowledges both his hurt and your appreciation for their past support.","

I feeel like i also should mention that me and my significant other are actually legally married, we just don't have a conventional relationship because we had some issues we needed to work through and what not..

Your response:
","You sound like you're in a tough spot, caught between being loyal to your husband and maintaining a connection with people who were there for you during a difficult time. It seems like you genuinely value the relationships you formed with this family, especially since they supported you when your husband was going through a tough time.

However, it's understandable that your husband feels betrayed, given what happened. It's not just about the incident, but also how the family reacted to it and didn't take responsibility for their actions.

I don't think it's necessarily about whether you're in the wrong or not, but more about being empathetic to your husband's feelings and concerns. Have you considered having an open conversation with him about your perspective and why you value this connection, while also acknowledging his feelings and hurt? It might be helpful to explore ways to navigate this situation together, rather than trying to decide whether you should or shouldn't see this family.","

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for not entirely cutting ties with people who screwed over my significant other?  Okay so this is kinda a long story and i hope i can explain it in a way that makes sense.

So me(26F) and my significant other(24M) moved to Michigan together last year (June 2021) and we were living with his friends family. We were going through some issues and my significant other ended up moving out quite a bit before me. This family we were living with 2 women (35 and 50) and their daughter (18) really hit it off with me and kind of became like my family. They were there for me, even when my significant other was not and i had nobody else in this state.

Fast forward to March 2022 and me and my significant other are good again, he is on bipolar meds and things are looking up. we take a weekend trip to chicago with some friends from our hometown. While we were gone my significant other gave the family a key to his apartment so they could bring in his hello fresh order for him. Once we got back it was disclosed to me that while we were gone, the 50F son(21M) aka the friend of my significant other used his key to go into his apartment, eat his food, go through his things, and have sex with someone in his bed. super fucked up. they told me about it and were not going to tell my significant other so i told them straight up that i thought that was fucked up and i was gonna tell him, so i did. he tried to address it with every member of the family and they all dismissed him and acted like he was making a big deal out of nothing. My significant other retaliated by reporting his friend for something and getting him in some pretty big trouble. Needless to say, my significant other and that family no longer have a relationship but I was still living with them.

I moved out into my own apartment in June of 2022 and i havent really seen or spoken to that family since despite them wanting to see me and us making plans a couple of times and them getting cancelled for whatever reason. I am on my sig others side and have kept my distance. But every friday night my sig other has been playing DnD with his friends and i have class early on saturday so i do not join. This family invited me to come over for pizza this Friday (tomorrow) and i told them sure but i wont stay long because i have to study for my exam saturday. I told my sig other about it and he is pretty upset and says he feels betrayed that i am still willing to see them and speak with them and i have tried to explain that their beef really doesnt involve me, but he disagrees. I dont think it is betrayal because my relationship with them is just different and they never wronged me. He wants me to cancel but it makes me feel bad because i already said yes and what not so i just need to know...AITA in this situation and i SHOULD cancel/cut them out of my life?

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a tough spot where your partner’s hurt is still raw, but you’ve no personal stake in the conflict. You’ve already moved out, and the family never wronged you directly. Your willingness to go for pizza is a normal, low‑stakes choice, not a betrayal. Your boyfriend’s “betrayal” comes from feeling excluded and hurt that you’re still connecting with the people who caused him pain. The key is honest communication: tell him you’re not defending them, you’re just being friendly, and you’re still committed to his feelings. Offer to stay for a short time or meet somewhere neutral, or agree to skip the Friday if it would ease his anxiety. If he still insists you cancel, try to find a compromise that respects both your autonomy and his emotional safety. Cutting ties entirely isn’t necessary unless the relationship with the family becomes toxic for you. Acknowledging his pain, setting clear boundaries, and showing you care about his wellbeing will help keep the trust intact.","

My BD (28M) left when our daughter (5F) was a month old, because he didn’t want to be around my family (parents, grandmother, etc.) while his family (parents, siblings, etc.) is in Arizona.

It’s been 5 years now, and in the past 3 years he’s had 2 other kids, I don’t know if it’s the same woman that’s not my need to know.

We only communicate when needed and that’s not very often. The last communication we had was about a month ago when he asked me for money and I flat out said ‘no’.

I have him on child support because I work a full time job to keep food in mine and my daughter belly and clothes on our backs. Which he hasn’t paid since 2018 totaling to about $14,500. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole:
After I said no to giving him money, I reminded him that he’s got 3 kids, and hasn’t paid child support in years. If anything I should be asking him for money, but I don’t.

He has some nerve to ask for money when he hasn't even been paying child support,25,2npac,,0,,"It sounds like you're in a tough situation, and you're doing your best to navigate it. Reminding your child's father about his responsibilities as a parent, especially after he asked you for money while owing a significant amount in child support, seems reasonable. It's understandable that you want to prioritize your daughter's well-being and ensure she gets the support she deserves. It's also important to set boundaries when communication becomes unproductive or emotionally taxing.

From what you've shared, it doesn't sound like you're being petty. You're addressing a legitimate concern about financial support and responsibility. It's crucial to maintain open communication when it benefits your child, but it's also crucial to protect your own mental and emotional health by enforcing boundaries when necessary. You're not the asshole for reminding him of his responsibilities; you're advocating for your daughter and yourself. Stay strong and continue doing what you believe is best for your family.","

Am I the asshole?.

Your response:
","Based on the situation you've described, you are not the asshole. Your response to his request for money was reasonable, especially given the significant unpaid child support. Let me break this down:

1. He has neglected his financial responsibilities to your daughter for years ($14,500 in unpaid support)
2. He chose to leave when your daughter was just one month old
3. Despite having other children and responsibilities, he had the audacity to ask YOU for money
4. Your response, while direct, was truthful and relevant to the situation

Your reaction shows frustration with his lack of responsibility, which is understandable. While telling him to only communicate on your daughter's birthday might be limiting, it's a boundary you're setting after what appears to be years of disappointment and financial strain.

The only suggestion I might make is to keep communication channels open for anything regarding your daughter's wellbeing, not just her birthday, as this serves your child's best interests. But overall, standing up for yourself and your daughter in this situation doesn't make you an asshole at all.","

Your response:
","You sound like someone who's been carrying a heavy burden for a long time. It's understandable that you're frustrated with your BD's lack of involvement and financial support. By reminding him that he has three kids, you were likely trying to convey the gravity of his responsibilities. 

It's not petty to point out the reality of his situation, especially given the significant amount of back child support he owes you. It's reasonable to expect him to take responsibility for his actions and provide for his children. Your priority is clearly your daughter's well-being, and it's admirable that you're working hard to provide for her. 

In this situation, it doesn't seem like you're the asshole. You're advocating for yourself and your daughter, and setting boundaries to protect your emotional well-being. His accusation of pettiness might be a deflection from his own shortcomings.","

vb6fkj,AITAH,AITA for ridiculing my ex wife's boyfriend for a perceived insult,holdingon41,"45M with 2 kids, Divorced recently.  Ex-wife is very much in my life as we are active co-parents. As we had been married for more than 16 years, we have the same social circle. The divorce was pretty recent so the wounds are still fresh.

My wife has been dating a guy for the last few months and she has already introduced them to the kids so I think it must be pretty serious. He had also been present for some of the community get-togethers in the last few months. Seeing that she had already introduced him to my children, I tried to be friendly with him.

He is a genial and candid guy. His conversational style is emotional, persuasive and lively and he has already become an entertainer in our circle as he is usually polite, sympathetic and sensitive.

Recently, one of our neighbors threw a house party (turning 50) and my ex was there along with boyfriend. Things went well until perhaps he had a drink too many. He became uncharacteristically enthusiastic and spirited as he started engaging everyone. He would call out someone from the party and ask them of their stance on some specific political issue. He would listen to them with a smile and then proceed to explain &amp; expound on it. While most were entertained, a few – especially the ones called out were visibly uncomfortable with it.

Finally, he came to me and asked what I thought of polyandry. I shrugged and said that it worked for some and didn’t for others. He then asked me if I had ever tried it. When I replied in the negative, he looked at me incredulously and asked “not even a threesome?”. I merely shrugged and didn’t bother replying. Thankfully, he smiled and nodded to himself and went on to the next topic. I thought that it would be the end of it.

During the toast, he raised a glass and said “To sex-positivity and to all the poor maidens who were victims of dead bedrooms” and winked at my ex who blushed. At that point, I was triggered like hell. I should now mention that I knew of a peculiar fact about him. He is 35 years old but for some reason he doesn't have a driver's license. I knew of it because my ex had mentioned it casually once when she had to drive and pick him up.

So, I toasted, “To poor ladies with deadbeat boyfriends who can’t even drive”

I registered with somewhat sadistic pleasure his face growing red at the remark as he glared at my ex. The whole atmosphere became tainted and I decided to leave.

But I started feeling guilty. I realized that I shouldn't have insulted him like that. Heck, he could have even had a medical reason for that in which case my remark might have come as callous.

Later I received a message from my ex-wife that she never expected that I would be so childish and was extremely disappointed in me. I offered to apologize to him but she asked me to just leave them alone.",39,37,1655104817,"Sounds like your ex’s bf loves to dish it out but just can’t taker it.

It's commendable that you recognize the impact of your words and are willing to apologize. It might be helpful to focus on maintaining a positive environment for your children and upholding a respectful co-parenting relationship. Consider reaching out to your ex-wife to express your intention to avoid such situations in the future and reinforce your commitment to a positive, cooperative dynamic. Remember, you're all adjusting to new roles and relationships, and it's okay to stumble as long as there is a genuine effort to move forward constructively.","

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy while being direct:

I understand you were hurt by his inappropriate comments and apparent reference to your past relationship, especially in a public setting. That must have felt humiliating and disrespectful. However, retaliating with a personal attack, while momentarily satisfying, ultimately lowered you to his level and may have damaged your co-parenting relationship.

As the father of your children and someone who needs to maintain a functional relationship with your ex-wife, taking the high road would have been better. You could have privately addressed his inappropriate behavior with him or your ex-wife later, or simply excused yourself from the situation.

Consider apologizing not just because you feel guilty, but because it's the mature thing to do for the sake of your children and ongoing co-parenting relationship. Moving forward, try to establish clear boundaries about appropriate behavior and remember that your children benefit from seeing their parents handle difficult situations with grace and respect.

The pain of divorce is real, but letting it drive us to act beneath our best selves only makes things harder in the long run.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

New personal Query: 

Q: AITA for ridiculing my ex wife's boyfriend for a perceived insult  45M with 2 kids, Divorced recently.  Ex-wife is very much in my life as we are active co-parents. As we had been married for more than 16 years, we have the same social circle. The divorce was pretty recent so the wounds are still fresh.

My wife has been dating a guy for the last few months and she has already introduced them to the kids so I think it must be pretty serious. He had also been present for some of the community get-togethers in the last few months. Seeing that she had already introduced him to my children, I tried to be friendly with him.

He is a genial and candid guy. His conversational style is emotional, persuasive and lively and he has already become an entertainer in our circle as he is usually polite, sympathetic and sensitive.

Recently, one of our neighbors threw a house party (turning 50) and my ex was there along with boyfriend. Things went well until perhaps he had a drink too many. He became uncharacteristically enthusiastic and spirited as he started engaging everyone. He would call out someone from the party and ask them of their stance on some specific political issue. He would listen to them with a smile and then proceed to explain &amp; expound on it. While most were entertained, a few – especially the ones called out were visibly uncomfortable with it.

Finally, he came to me and asked what I thought of polyandry. I shrugged and said that it worked for some and didn’t for others. He then asked me if I had ever tried it. When I replied in the negative, he looked at me incredulously and asked “not even a threesome?”. I merely shrugged and didn’t bother replying. Thankfully, he smiled and nodded to himself and went on to the next topic. I thought that it would be the end of it.

During the toast, he raised a glass and said “To sex-positivity and to all the poor maidens who were victims of dead bedrooms” and winked at my ex who blushed. At that point, I was triggered like hell. I should now mention that I knew of a peculiar fact about him. He is 35 years old but for some reason he doesn't have a driver's license. I knew of it because my ex had mentioned it casually once when she had to drive and pick him up.

So, I toasted, “To poor ladies with deadbeat boyfriends who can’t even drive”

I registered with somewhat sadistic pleasure his face growing red at the remark as he glared at my ex. The whole atmosphere became tainted and I decided to leave.

But I started feeling guilty. I realized that I shouldn't have insulted him like that. Heck, he could have even had a medical reason for that in which case my remark might have come as callous.

Later I received a message from my ex-wife that she never expected that I would be so childish and was extremely disappointed in me. I offered to apologize to him but she asked me to just leave them alone..

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions - guilt, regret, and maybe a bit of justification for your actions. On the one hand, you felt triggered by your ex-wife's boyfriend's comment and the perceived jab at your past relationship. On the other hand, you realize that your response might have been hurtful and unnecessary.

I sense that you're struggling with the transition from being in a long-term relationship to co-parenting and navigating new social dynamics. It's understandable that you'd feel the need to defend yourself or your past, but it's also clear that you're recognizing the potential harm caused by your words.

It's interesting that you mention feeling ""somewhat sadistic pleasure"" in seeing your ex-wife's boyfriend's reaction. This might suggest that there's still some unresolved tension or anger that you're working through. Apologizing to him might be a step towards healing and growth, but it's also important to consider your ex-wife's request to give them space.

What do you think is driving your need to respond or react in situations like this? Is there something specific that you're trying to protect or prove?","

Your response:
","You sound torn, like you’re fighting between protecting your children’s sense of security and maintaining your own dignity. On one hand, the remark felt like a reflexive defense of your ex‑wife’s image; on the other, it ended up humiliating someone who had no stake in your family’s dynamics. It seems you’re already aware that the comment was unfair and that it may have been driven by hurt rather than intention.  

It might help to reach out personally to the boyfriend, apologize for the comment, and explain that you were reacting to a joke that felt demeaning to your ex. A sincere, private apology can restore some respect without reopening the broader family drama. If your ex prefers you stay out of it, give her space—yet keep the door open for a respectful, one‑on‑one apology.","

How can you even think that is ok?",105,Randa08,"You could always talk to your ex.  Tell her you are seeing someone new and that your FIL has invited both of you to dinner.  Ask her if she is ok with you bringing a date or if that will be too uncomfortable for her.  If she isn't ok with it then don't do it or you will be TA. 

And her dad, total asshole.  What kind of father has his daughter cook a meal for everyone and simultaneously does anything to try to intentionally hurt her and cause drama.  Ok fine, they don't have a great relationship.  That is not an excuse to shit on someone.  Either don't include her or include her and treat her properly.

Edit:. Just realized your new partner is your wife, not girlfriend.  If your ex isn't ok with your wife at a family dinner then you shouldn't go to a family dinner.  Your wife is part of your family, if she isn't accepted then neither are you.

Consider what outcome you truly want from attending this event. Is it to maintain a positive relationship with your ex father-in-law, or could it potentially create more tension and conflict? It might be worthwhile to weigh the importance of your presence there against the potential discomfort it could cause, especially for your children. Perhaps having an open discussion with your sons about their feelings and finding a compromise could help in making a decision that considers everyone's feelings.","

Your response:
","I hear a lot of hurt and anger in your message, especially about the divorce and how it's affected your relationship with your children. While it might feel satisfying in the moment to ""get back"" at your ex by showing up with your younger wife, I'm concerned about how this could impact your sons. One son is already threatening to distance himself, which suggests this situation is really taking a toll on him.

It sounds like there's still a lot of unresolved pain here - both yours and your ex's. Even though your ex father-in-law invited you, using this gathering as a way to provoke tension could damage your relationships with your children further. They're caught in the middle of this conflict.

Perhaps consider what you really want long-term - getting even with your ex, or having a healthy relationship with your sons? Sometimes being the ""bigger person"" isn't about who's right or wrong, but about breaking cycles of hurt for the sake of your children.

Would you be open to discussing what healthier ways of dealing with these feelings might look like?","

","It sounds like you're caught in a complex web of family dynamics, and you're considering using this opportunity as a way to prove a point or assert your new life. I sense a mix of emotions - possibly a desire to show your ex that you've moved on, and a need to assert your new relationship, especially since your current wife is younger. 

However, I also hear the concerns of your sister and one of your sons, who think this might hurt your ex and create more tension. It's understandable that you feel your ex has wronged you in the past, but it's also important to consider the potential impact on your children. 

Before making a decision, ask yourself: what's the primary motivation behind bringing your new wife to Thanksgiving? Is it to genuinely celebrate the holiday with your family, or is it to make a statement? What are the potential long-term consequences for your relationships with your ex, your children, and your current wife?","

Your response:
","I understand you were defending your sister during an incredibly emotional and sensitive moment. Your Tia's comments were cruel and insensitive, especially during what should have been a special celebration. However, responding with physical violence, even when emotions are running high, isn't the right way to handle the situation.

Your heart was in the right place - you wanted to protect your sister and honor her father's memory. But slapping your Tia escalated the situation and took attention away from supporting your sister in her moment of grief. There were better ways to address your Tia's inappropriate comments, like firmly but calmly telling her that her words were hurtful and disrespectful.

While you're not a bad person for wanting to stand up for your sister, the method you chose wasn't appropriate. Your sister's appreciation of your support, while also noting you shouldn't have slapped your Tia, shows she understands both your protective instinct and why the response went too far.

Consider apologizing to your Tia for the slap, while also expressing why her comments were deeply hurtful.","

Your response:
","It sounds like the situation at your sister's Quinceanera was very emotional, and your Tia's comment triggered a strong reaction from you. While I understand that you were trying to protect your sister, slapping your Tia was not the best way to handle the situation.

It's clear that you were trying to stand up for your sister and express empathy for her loss. However, physical violence is never an acceptable response, especially in a situation where your sister was already vulnerable and emotional. Your mother and sister's reactions also suggest that your actions were not seen as justified.

It's possible that a more constructive way to handle the situation would have been to calmly speak to your Tia and express your feelings in a respectful manner. This way, you could have still stood up for your sister without resorting to physical violence.","

Your response:
","It sounds like a really painful night for everyone. Your sister’s loss and her emotional reaction were already overwhelming, and the aunt’s comment—especially after a fragile moment—can feel like an unnecessary sting. While it’s understandable you were upset, slapping her crossed a line that makes it hard for people to feel safe around you. It’s not just “being a good sister” but also respecting boundaries, even when emotions run high. A sincere apology to both your sister and your aunt could help start healing. If the hurt feels deep or you’re unsure how to express it, consider writing a note or asking a neutral family member or counselor to mediate a conversation. Showing that you care about her pain, rather than reacting physically, will rebuild trust and show the love you truly want to share.","

My sister worked extra hours to afford tickets, but sadly it wasn’t enough and was going to wait until a few days before the concert to buy the tickets. My sister is still under 18 and asked me to go with her since she needed someone over 18 to go with her. I told her sure and she was going to pay for my ticket and cover gas.

I said sure, and told my sister that she would need to find someone else to take her, when I told her she started bawling her eyes out and shouting at me. She told me that I was a bitch for this and she would never forgive me. I told her she was exaggerating. 
Well the night of the concert came and I went with my friends to the club and when I got home my sister wouldn’t even look or speak to me.

She has every right to be upset.,59,Network_Error4040,,0,,"It sounds like a tough situation, and I can see why both you and your sister are upset. From what you've described, it seems your sister was counting on you to support her, especially since she'd worked hard to make the concert happen. Your decision to choose clubbing with friends over fulfilling a promise might have felt like a betrayal to her, especially since there was a similar incident two years ago. 

It's understandable to want to have fun with friends, but it’s also important to consider the commitments you make to those who rely on you. Your sister's reaction might reflect disappointment and a sense of being let down repeatedly. 

Acknowledging her feelings and offering a sincere apology could be a good step. Maybe you can find another way to spend meaningful time together or support her interests in the future. It’s important to communicate and try to rebuild trust, showing her that you value her and your relationship.","

Your response:
","Based on the situation described, yes, you were in the wrong here. This appears to be a pattern of breaking promises to your sister, not just a one-time incident. She worked hard to save money, made plans with you in advance, and trusted you to follow through. You dismissed her feelings and broke your commitment for last-minute social plans.

What makes it worse is that instead of acknowledging how your actions hurt her, you minimized her feelings by saying she was ""exaggerating"" and that ""there will be many more concerts."" Her emotional reaction seems justified given this is the second time you've broken a similar promise to her.

The relationship between siblings is built on trust and reliability. When you repeatedly let someone down, especially a younger sibling who looks up to you, it causes real emotional damage. Your parents are right - it was wrong to commit to something important to your sister and then bail on her. Consider apologizing sincerely and making a genuine effort to be more reliable with your commitments to her in the future.","

Your response:
","It seems like there's a lot of hurt and disappointment between you and your sister. On the surface, it might seem like a simple decision to choose between going to a concert with your sister or clubbing with friends, but for your sister, it's clearly about more than just the concert. It sounds like she felt let down by you before, and this recent incident brought up past feelings of abandonment.

I sense that you care about your sister, but it's possible that you didn't fully consider her perspective and the importance of this concert to her. By breaking your promise to take her, you may have inadvertently sent the message that your plans with friends are more important than your commitment to her.

Rather than dismissing her feelings as an overreaction, it might be helpful to have a more empathetic conversation with your sister and acknowledge the hurt you've caused her. This could be an opportunity to repair your relationship and rebuild trust.","

Your response:
","It sounds like both of you are carrying a lot of hurt and expectation. You made a promise you didn’t feel you could keep, and your sister’s reaction is a mix of disappointment and a lingering memory of a past let‑down. She’s still under 18, so she’s looking to you for a safety net, and when that safety net feels shaky she can lash out. At the same time, you were faced with a sudden invitation that pulled your priorities in a different direction, and you felt you needed to say “no” to preserve your own commitments. The key isn’t to blame one side or the other; it’s to acknowledge the broken promise, apologize for the pain it caused, and set clear boundaries about what you can realistically do in the future. That might help rebuild trust and let both of you move past the “bitch” labels.","

Your response:
","I hear how deeply this betrayal has affected you, especially happening during such a painful time when your family was grieving your brother. It's completely understandable to feel hurt and angry about your stepfather's actions, and to want to protect yourself and your children from someone who has demonstrated such poor judgment and character.

While your mother has made her choice to forgive him, you have every right to set your own boundaries. However, given that he's been in your children's lives since birth and your mother is your main support system, this situation requires careful consideration. Perhaps you could work toward a middle ground - like having visits occur at your mother's house when she's present, rather than cutting off contact entirely.

You're not wrong for wanting to limit contact, but consider discussing your feelings openly with your mother and working together to find arrangements that respect both your boundaries and your need for support. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to have them acknowledged while finding a workable solution for everyone involved.","

It's also important to acknowledge that your children do have a bond with your stepdad, but that doesn't mean you have to accept him back into your life if you're not ready.""","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: stepfather cheated on my mom aita for not wanting him around me and my kids?  Venting.
I (25 f) have always had a strained relationship with my stepdad (55 m) , and he made it worse when he openly addmitted to having an affair with his cousin. 
During the time he cheated my mother (49 f)
Was grieving my brother who was killed in 2015.
(No I won't go into detail about his death)
So my entire family was shook when SD admitted and carried on the affair for 2 more years. He kept telling Ma hebloved her and would stop this relationship,  as well as telling his cousin the same thing.
Well finally he dropped contact with cousin and my mother forgave him (im hoping its because he'll die sooner and get life insurance)
Buut ive openly told my mother indont care if she forgave him, or if she wants to be with him. I do not want to have contact or a relationship with him anymore and yet she still forces it upon me. (For examply my son (6 m) is staying with themnfor a night, and he will do the drop off next day) so would i be the ahole for not letting my son visit for the night?

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy mix of grief, betrayal, and responsibility for your kids. It’s understandable that you’re angry and want distance from your stepdad. At the same time, your mom is dealing with her own pain and may see him as a source of support. You’re not an “ahole”; you’re trying to protect your children and yourself.

Try a calm, honest conversation with your mom. Explain why you feel unsafe or uncomfortable with the arrangement—focus on the kids’ well‑being, not on judging her choices. Suggest a compromise: maybe your son can stay at a nearby relative’s or a friend’s house that night, or schedule visits on your terms. If needed, bring a neutral third party—counselor or mediator—to help set clear boundaries that respect everyone’s needs.

Above all, keep your children’s safety and emotional health first. You’re doing the hard work of protecting them, and that deserves respect and support.","

ESH",3,C_Noel,"It sounds like you're in a tough situation, and it's understandable to feel conflicted about your actions. Trust is a crucial component of any relationship, and when it's broken, it can lead to actions like going through each other's phones. Your decision to check his phone seems to stem from a place of concern and suspicion, especially given past experiences. However, it also raises questions about trust and privacy in your relationship.

Your boyfriend’s response might be defensive because he feels his privacy was violated, but it's important to focus on the underlying issues that led to this situation. The fact that you found concerning content on his phone suggests that there are trust issues that need addressing.

Consider having an open and honest conversation with him about how both of you can rebuild trust. Express your feelings and concerns without assigning blame. It might also be helpful to set boundaries that respect both your needs for privacy and transparency. A healthy relationship requires mutual respect and understanding, and addressing these issues together could strengthen your bond.","

Your response:
","Based on the situation you've described, this seems like a complex issue where trust has been damaged on both sides. While going through someone's phone without permission isn't ideal, I understand your concerns given what you found - especially the escort site activity and multiple private conversations with other women.

It's concerning that your boyfriend reacted with anger about trust issues rather than addressing the concerning content you found. This could indeed be a form of deflection or gaslighting, shifting focus from his potentially inappropriate behavior to your actions in discovering it.

The fact that he previously went through your phone but is now upset about you doing the same suggests a double standard. Combined with the age gap and the timing (shortly after having a baby), these could be red flags worth paying attention to.

Consider seeking couples counseling to address these trust issues and establish healthy boundaries. Both of you deserve a relationship built on honesty and mutual respect, especially with a young child involved.","

Your response:
","It seems like you're caught in a cycle of mistrust, and both of you have crossed each other's boundaries by going through each other's phones. You feel justified in your actions, given his past behavior of snooping through your phone and re-downloading Snapchat. However, his anger towards you stems from the fact that you invaded his privacy, regardless of the reasons behind it.

I sense that you're hurt and feel disrespected by the fact that he had multiple female contacts reaching out to him without disclosing this information to you. Your request for him to delete Snapchat is a way of establishing boundaries and seeking reassurance. On the other hand, he might see this as an attack on his trustworthiness.

It's not entirely clear whether you're the asshole or he is. Perhaps a more constructive approach would be to have an open conversation about boundaries, trust, and communication. By addressing the underlying issues and working together to establish mutual respect, you both may be able to break this cycle of mistrust and rebuild a stronger connection.","

Your response:
","I hear your concern about financial stability - it's clearly something you've worked hard to achieve, especially coming from a challenging background. It's understandable that you want a partner who shares similar values around work and financial independence.

It sounds like you're wrestling with feeling judgmental while also having legitimate practical concerns about building a future with someone. There's nothing wrong with wanting a partner who can contribute equally to a relationship, both emotionally and financially. Your experiences have taught you the importance of financial security.

Perhaps instead of focusing on whether you're being an ""asshole,"" you could reframe this as being clear about your values and what you need in a partnership. It's okay to have standards that align with your lifestyle and goals. This isn't about looking down on others - it's about finding someone compatible with the life you've built for yourself.

After we broke up, I went to his place of work when he wasn't there and asked to see ex-bf's boss. Ex-bf's boss took me to the office in the back because I told him it was a personal matter about one of his employees.

I then spent an hour talking to ex-bf's boss about the shit my ex put me through (including ex-bf threatening to kill himself if I broke up with him) and showed him the photos of the abuse which was awful for me to relive, but I wanted ex-bf's boss to know what a scumbag my ex was.

I gave the boss my number and email in case they needed to speak to me.

3 days later, ex-bf's boss contacts me and tells me that he spoke to management. ""We can't keep someone here, knowing what you've shown us. We're firing him and telling other branches not to accept any applications from him. Thank you for coming forward."" (This is me cutting down the email so you can understand.)

Not only that but this internet stranger and abuse survivor is very proud of you!,4,B0326C0821,"It sounds like you’ve been through a very difficult and traumatic experience, and I’m sorry you had to endure that. Speaking up about abuse takes a lot of courage, and it’s understandable that you wanted to protect others from experiencing similar harm. By informing your ex's boss, you were taking a step to ensure your safety and potentially the safety of others who might interact with him. 

While some might argue that personal matters should remain private, abuse is a serious issue that can affect not only the victim but also those around the abuser. Employers have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment, and by sharing your experience, you gave them the opportunity to make an informed decision about your ex's employment. 

It's natural to feel conflicted in such situations, but prioritizing safety and accountability is crucial. You are not an asshole for seeking justice and trying to prevent further harm. Remember to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or professionals who can help you navigate any lingering feelings from this ordeal.","

Am I the asshole for exposing my ex's shitty behaviour to his boss?.

Your response:
","I want to acknowledge how much courage it must have taken to speak up about the abuse you endured. You're not an asshole for exposing the truth about your ex's violent behavior. His actions were criminal, and you had every right to share your experience with relevant parties.

However, I'm concerned about your safety. Abusers often escalate their behavior when they feel they're losing control or after being exposed. Please consider:

1. Documenting everything and keeping records
2. Informing trusted friends/family about the situation
3. Contacting a domestic violence hotline for support and safety planning
4. Filing a police report if you haven't already
5. Looking into legal protection options like restraining orders

While his firing may be a natural consequence of his actions, your primary focus should be on your safety and healing. Have you connected with any domestic violence support services? They can provide valuable resources and guidance during this time.

You showed tremendous strength in breaking free from abuse. Now, please prioritize protecting yourself as you move forward.","

","It takes a lot of courage to share what you've been through, and it sounds like you stood up for yourself in a powerful way. By reporting the abuse to your ex's boss, you're not only taking care of yourself but also potentially protecting others from experiencing the same harm. 

It's understandable that your ex might react negatively, but it's not your fault that his actions have consequences. You didn't create the situation; he did. It's also important to recognize that you're not just speaking out against your ex, but also advocating for a safer work environment.

It's not about being an ""asshole"" or not; it's about taking responsibility for the harm that's been done and working towards accountability and change. You've taken a brave step, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and safety.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you were in a very painful place and were looking for a way to protect yourself and perhaps others. You didn’t “expose” him for drama; you brought concrete evidence of abuse to someone who could act on it. That’s a step many survivors take to cut the cycle of violence. You’re not acting as a judge or a vengeful friend—you’re seeking accountability and safety.

That said, it’s important to keep your own safety and well‑being front‑of‑mind. Make sure you have support (therapy, a trusted friend, or a domestic‑abuse hotline) and consider legal counsel if you’re worried about retaliation. You’ve done what you could to stop him from potentially harming others. In short, you’re not the asshole; you’re a survivor who’s taken a courageous step. Take care of yourself after this, and keep documenting everything just in case.","

My daughter started feeling I’ll yesterday and his first comment was well are we going to the dinners, I told him I don’t feel comfortable with anyone watching while she’s not feeling well.

It might help to have a frank conversation with your husband about how you’re feeling. Express your need for support, especially when your daughter is unwell. It’s important that both of you are on the same page about prioritizing family needs, particularly during difficult times. Perhaps you can work together to find a compromise that allows him some social time while ensuring your daughter has the care she needs and you have the support you deserve.

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and hurt you're feeling right now. It's completely understandable to feel angry when you're caring for an ill child and your partner seems more focused on social obligations than supporting the family during a difficult time.

It sounds like there's a deeper issue here - not just about this one party, but about the imbalance in responsibilities and perhaps feeling isolated or unsupported in your role as your daughter's primary caregiver. Your husband's behavior (saying he'll ""just say hi"" but staying for hours with minimal communication) suggests he may not fully appreciate the emotional and physical demands of caring for a child with chronic conditions.

You're not being an asshole for feeling these emotions. Your feelings are valid, and it's reasonable to expect your partner to prioritize family needs, especially when your daughter isn't well. Perhaps it would be helpful to have an honest conversation with your husband about how his choices are affecting you and work together to find a better balance that supports both family needs and social connections.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve been carrying a huge load—watching your daughter, managing her health, and juggling the lack of a flexible job—while your husband’s social calendar keeps expanding. Feeling upset and even crying is a normal reaction to being left in the dark and feeling unheard. You’re not being an “asshole”; you’re simply reacting to a pattern that’s been draining your energy and attention.

Try to set a calm moment to talk. Explain how his weekend outings make you feel sidelined, and ask for a concrete plan: maybe one family outing a month, and clear communication (e.g., a quick text or call if he’s going to be away for a while). If he’s willing to compromise, it can ease the tension. If he’s not, you may need to assert boundaries to protect your emotional well‑being and focus on your daughter’s needs. Remember, your feelings are valid.","

While it's natural to have strong reactions to high-profile trials, especially ones involving sensitive topics like domestic abuse, it might be worth considering how mocking anyone's testimony about abuse (regardless of credibility) could affect others who have experienced trauma. The trial clearly stirred up a lot of emotions for many people. Rather than focusing on judging the performance aspects, perhaps we could have a more constructive discussion about why this case resonated so strongly with people or what it revealed about how our society handles these complex issues.","

However, it's essential to separate our opinions about someone's acting abilities from the facts of a case. While it's understandable to have doubts, making judgments solely based on her performance on the stand might not be entirely fair. It's also worth considering the complexities of the situation and the potential emotional toll it took on the individuals involved. Have you considered looking into the case's evidence and court findings to form a more informed opinion, rather than just relying on your impression of her testimony?","

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

Q: Aitah for believing Amber Heard?  Jokes 😂 what is her pathetic acting session on that stand?! What is that?! I’ve seen better acting from adult films 😂.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated and perhaps even a bit amused by the way the courtroom drama unfolded. Those public moments can feel exaggerated or theatrical, especially when the stakes are so high for everyone involved. At the same time, the situation touches on serious accusations and legal consequences that impact real lives. Whether or not you agree with the portrayals, it can be helpful to remember that each side is navigating a highly charged environment, often with limited information available to the audience.

If the spectacle feels overwhelming, you might find it useful to step back from the social media commentary and focus on reliable reporting or official court documents. That","

wdi0ih,AITAH,"AITA for refusing to go to my grandma's funeral and later driving by with my friend blasting ""The wicked witch is dead"" from The Wizard of Oz?",luvsmana,"I know the title sounds bad, but let me explain. So I(14 genderfluid) had a horrible grandmother(83F), who was never there for me. She always liked my cousins more, because they are men. For context as to why this is relevant, I am AFAB and my grandma had two daughters(my mother and my aunt). My aunt(51F) has always been one of the closest relatives to me, even closer than my parents, due to the fact they only care for my academic success and not my mental and physical health. My mother(46F) was never close to my grandmother, as she was always neglected as a child and only had my grandfather(deceased). My aunt on the other hand, has a seriously strong bond with her mother. She was the favorite child, that's for sure, and even she admits that. I tried my best to keep it together and show a happy face towards my grandma until 2 years ago, only a few weeks after my grandfather's death, she gave away the toy piano my grandpa gave me to this one 3 years old relative, who to this day can't speak, eat or drink properly. I was furious. This may not seem like a big deal, but to me it was, as that small little toy piano was the last thing I had from my grandfather who always treated me with nothing but kindness and love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that day, I swore to never step foot anywhere near my grandmother, however, last year, I had to attend for her birthday lunch. This incident was probably the one that made my dislike for her strong enough to do what I did. As soon as we(my mother and I) arrived, it was obvious I was not really welcome there. I kept quiet and read something whilst the others were chatting away, until my aunt came up to me to ask if I was okay, since I was visibly upset. I told her I didn't feel welcomed and wanted to go home. She promised as soon as I finished my plate she'd take me home. And she did. But before I got in her car, my grandmother yelled after me, calling me a useless child and telling me she never wants to see me again.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 months ago, she(my grandma) got really sick and got into the hospital. She begged my aunt to take me to her, but I refused. After all she did to me? Hell no. I told my aunt this, who repeatedly tried to convince me to do otherwise, but it didn't work. I love my aunt a lot, but not enough for this. About 2 weeks after that my grandma finally passed away. I called my best friend(19F) right after the news and she came over to celebrate with me. This may sound like an asshole move, but I honestly didn't give two shits.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago, my grandmother's funeral took place. My aunt came to convince me to come in person, but I explained to her I was not going, as I would not be able to stand the amount of respect this scum of earth would be getting from every relative. She was visibly upset by this, but respected my decision and left soon after. My mother got really mad at me for refusin to attend and called me a ""selfish bitch who has no respect for his ancestors and needs to get a grip"". She and my father(53M) left for the funeral shortly after and in a sudden rage, I called my best friend. I told her to pick me upp with her car.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as she arrived, I hopped in the car and connected my phone to her car's speakers. We slowly drove around the cemetery the funeral was held at before finally decidin on the perfect time to blast the absolute banger that is ""The wicked witch is dead"". In the middle of the funeral speech, I started blasting the song starting from ""Ding dong the witch is dead, the wicked witch is deaaaaad"". An angry looking aunt stormed outside of the cemetary and just caught a glimpse of my red hair, which was enough for her to identify me. We sped off, and thought nothing would come of this little ""prank"".

&amp;#x200B;

After the funeral ended, I got a very angry call from my mother yelling at me for this manouvre. I could hear my aunt calming her down, which was a suprise, because I thought she(aunt) would be the angrier one. I hung up on my mom, and in that second my phone rang, indicating my aunt was calling me. She in the end scolded me a little bit and told me this was an asshole move to pull. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom called me an asshole too, I didn't really care much about that, but when my aunt did it,it got to me, so AITA?

Was there something else your Grandmother did that would justify the level of hate and disrespect you showed her? Because if that's it, I'm not seeing it.

You were closer with your Granddad. That's great!

You are showing alot of prejudice against a younger disabled (?) cousin. That's disturbing. 

You showed your Mom and Aunt alot of really hurtful disrespect. 

YTA without a doubt.",4,georgiajl38,"It sounds like you're navigating a very complex and emotionally charged situation. The feelings you have towards your grandmother seem deeply rooted in past experiences and hurtful interactions. It's understandable that her actions, particularly the incident with the toy piano, left a lasting impact on you. Your choice not to attend the funeral reflects your personal boundaries and feelings, which are valid. However, the decision to drive by and play that song during the funeral might have been hurtful to others who had a different relationship with her, like your aunt.

Your aunt's reaction suggests she cares about you and perhaps understands your pain, yet she was also hurt by your actions. It's clear you have a strong bond with her, and her opinion matters to you. It might be worth discussing your feelings and actions with her to help both of you find some understanding and possibly heal from this event. Remember, it's okay to feel conflicted, and seeking guidance from someone you trust could be beneficial.","

Your response:
","I hear how deeply hurt you are by your grandmother's treatment of you, especially regarding the toy piano from your beloved grandfather. Those wounds are clearly still very raw. At the same time, disrupting a funeral ceremony not only affected your grandmother's memory, but also caused pain to people you care about, particularly your aunt who has shown you understanding and support.

While your feelings of anger and hurt are completely valid, acting them out in this way may have damaged important relationships and possibly your own emotional wellbeing. At 14, you're dealing with complex emotions and family dynamics. Have you considered talking to a counselor or therapist who could help you process these difficult feelings in healthier ways?

Your aunt seems to be someone who cares about you deeply despite her relationship with your grandmother. Perhaps having an honest conversation with her about your feelings could help repair any strain this incident may have caused. Remember that healing from family trauma takes time and support - you don't have to face this alone.","

","I can feel the pain and hurt you've carried with you for so long. It's clear that your grandma's actions, especially giving away the toy piano, left deep scars. It's understandable that you didn't want to attend the funeral or show respect to someone who treated you poorly. 

Your actions, although provocative, seem to be a manifestation of the anger and frustration you've been holding onto. Blasting ""The Wicked Witch is Dead"" may have been a childish move, but it also shows how you're trying to cope with the emotions that have been bottled up inside.

It's interesting that your aunt's scolding affected you more than your mom's. This might be because your aunt has been a source of support and comfort for you, and her disappointment stings. 

In this situation, I wouldn't say you're entirely in the wrong, but I would encourage you to consider the impact of your actions on those around you, especially your aunt. It might be helpful to have an open conversation with her about your feelings and why you reacted the way you did. This could be an opportunity for healing and growth, not just for you, but also for your relationship with your aunt.","

I called my best friend(19F) right after the news and she came over to celebrate with me. This may sound like an asshole move, but I honestly didn't give two shits.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago, my grandmother's funeral took place. My aunt came to convince me to come in person, but I explained to her I was not going, as I would not be able to stand the amount of respect this scum of earth would be getting from every relative. She was visibly upset by this, but respected my decision and left soon after. My mother got really mad at me for refusin to attend and called me a ""selfish bitch who has no respect for his ancestors and needs to get a grip"". She and my father(53M) left for the funeral shortly after and in a sudden rage, I called my best friend. I told her to pick me upp with her car.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as she arrived, I hopped in the car and connected my phone to her car's speakers. We slowly drove around the cemetery the funeral was held at before finally decidin on the perfect time to blast the absolute banger that is ""The wicked witch is dead"". In the middle of the funeral speech, I started blasting the song starting from ""Ding dong the witch is dead, the wicked witch is deaaaaad"". An angry looking aunt stormed outside of the cemetary and just caught a glimpse of my red hair, which was enough for her to identify me. We sped off, and thought nothing would come of this little ""prank"".

&amp;#x200B;

After the funeral ended, I got a very angry call from my mother yelling at me for this manouvre. I could hear my aunt calming her down, which was a suprise, because I thought she(aunt) would be the angrier one. I hung up on my mom, and in that second my phone rang, indicating my aunt was calling me. She in the end scolded me a little bit and told me this was an asshole move to pull. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom called me an asshole too, I didn't really care much about that, but when my aunt did it,it got to me, so AITA?

Mind you, my mother does not drive. So I would’ve had to drive 40 minutes to pick her up and 40 minutes to take her to my house to have her stay with me.

It's important to respect both parties, but ultimately, you have to make a decision that feels right for you. It seems like you're trying to accommodate your mother by spending part of the day with her, which is considerate. Her reaction might be coming from a place of disappointment or feeling left out, especially if she values family traditions.

It's not easy to navigate these dynamics, but it sounds like you're trying to be fair and thoughtful.

Your response:
","It sounds like you're caught in a really difficult situation, trying to balance your mother's expectations with your boyfriend's boundaries. Your attempt to find a compromise by splitting the day shows you're trying to be considerate of everyone's needs. While your mother's reaction might feel hurtful and overwhelming, it likely comes from a place of fear about losing connection with you, especially during a meaningful holiday.

However, you're not wrong for setting boundaries. At 26, it's natural and healthy to establish your own holiday traditions and balance relationships with both family and romantic partners. The fact that you offered a compromise instead of completely excluding your mother shows you're trying to be thoughtful about everyone's feelings.

Perhaps you could have a calm conversation with your mother about why this arrangement feels so threatening to her, while still maintaining your boundaries. Remember that setting healthy boundaries, though difficult, doesn't make you an asshole - it makes you a mature adult managing complex relationships.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling torn between wanting to spend time with your mother and also respecting your boyfriend's boundaries. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to compromise his mental health, especially given the triggering nature of interactions with your mother. 

It's interesting that you mention your mother not respecting his boundaries, yet she's also not respecting yours. By expecting you to spend the entire Christmas with her and not considering your boyfriend's feelings, she's essentially disregarding your own desires and relationship. 

It seems like your decision to set boundaries with your mother, though difficult, was made with the intention of being considerate of both parties involved. It's not about being the ""asshole,"" but rather about prioritizing your own well-being and that of your partner.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re caught between two people who both mean a lot to you, and that’s a tough spot to be in. Your boyfriend’s boundary isn’t about him “not liking” your mother; it’s a protective measure for his own mental health, and you’re right to prioritize that. At the same time, your mother was expecting a family celebration and probably felt hurt when you stepped away. The tantrum was likely a defensive reaction to that disappointment.

You’re not the asshole for honoring his limits, but the next step might be to sit down with your mother and explain why you couldn’t accommodate her in the way she’d hoped—emphasize that it’s not a judgment of her, just a difficult compromise. Offer a separate,","

My dad moved into a mouldy little flat with me and my older brother until eventually he started dating a woman. We shall call her Mildred. So shortly after my dad and Mildred started dating they got engaged so me(15) and my brother(17) had to move into their 3 bedroom house with her and her 2 kids. (She had 3 but one eventually moved out). So she had 3 girls (13, mid 20s and late 20s). We will call the 13yo entitled brat, middle child blonde brat and the eldest rat. So my dad and Mildred shared the medium sized bedroom, entitled brat got the master bedroom with a double bed and Ensuite, my brother got the box room with a fold out single bed and I slept on a single lumpy mattress on the floor of entitled brats bedroom until they kicked me out of there and made me sleep on the living room floor. 

So it was clear that Mildred didn’t like me or my brother from the start.

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy and clarity to this difficult situation:

You are absolutely not the asshole here. What you experienced was discriminatory treatment and emotional abuse, not just from Mildred but also from your father who failed to protect you. Being forced to sleep on the floor, having basic privileges denied, and being subjected to different rules than your step-sibling are all forms of mistreatment that no child should endure.

The most concerning part is your father's violent reaction - punching through glass - which shows a dangerous loss of control. His failure to stand up for you and ensure equal treatment in the household represents a serious breach of his parental responsibilities.

You didn't ruin their relationship - their own actions and choices did that. Your father's engagement ending was likely due to multiple issues, not your ""disobedience."" Setting boundaries by moving out and eventually cutting contact were healthy responses to protect yourself from an toxic environment.

Please know that none of this was your fault. You deserved to feel safe, valued and equally treated in your own home.","

Your response:
","I can sense the deep pain and hurt you're still carrying from those experiences. It sounds like you felt constantly belittled and mistreated by Mildred and her children, and that your dad didn't protect you or treat you with the same love and respect. Despite trying your best to follow the rules, you still felt unappreciated and unloved. It's understandable that you'd be angry and hurt by your dad's reaction, especially since it seemed to come from a place of defending Mildred rather than standing up for you.

While it's possible that your actions may have contributed to the breakdown of their relationship, it's essential to recognize that you were a teenager in a very difficult situation, trying to navigate an emotionally toxic environment. Your feelings and needs were valid, and it's not fair to place the entire blame on you. It's also important to acknowledge that your dad's reaction was unacceptable and hurtful. Have you considered talking to your dad about how his actions affected you and trying to rebuild your relationship?","

(She had 3 but one eventually moved out). So she had 3 girls (13, mid 20s and late 20s). We will call the 13yo entitled brat, middle child blonde brat and the eldest rat. So my dad and Mildred shared the medium sized bedroom, entitled brat got the master bedroom with a double bed and Ensuite, my brother got the box room with a fold out single bed and I slept on a single lumpy mattress on the floor of entitled brats bedroom until they kicked me out of there and made me sleep on the living room floor. 

So it was clear that Mildred didn’t like me or my brother from the start. I would be extra helpful and do all the chores around the house and still she treated me like crap and said I didn’t do enough yet all entitled brat did was make a mess but she never got in trouble because she was a little princess. Things continued to be unfair throughout my time living there. I wasn’t allowed to call my boyfriend when I was there, I wasn’t allowed to take any of my belongings out of my suitcase on the floor next to my bed, I wasn’t allowed to sit on the sofa, I wasn’t allowed to say anything without fear of being yelled at, I had my phone taken away at night time, I wasn’t allowed friends over, I couldn’t have food or even water in the bedroom, I wasn’t allowed to use anything in the bathroom like the soaps unless I bought them or even watch the tv. These were all things entitled brat was allowed to do that I wasn’t. Things were even worse on family holidays. I wasn’t allowed to do anything I wanted to do, my boyfriend wasn’t allowed to come even though entitled brats was when I asked first, I even ended up sleeping on the floor on 3 separate holidays even though my dad paid for the entire things. Eventually I got so sick of it and moved to my mums house full time and apparently me being disobedient was part of why my dad broke up with Mildred even though I always did my best and followed all of those stupid rules. I ended up calling Mildred an asshole after they broke up and my dad punched through a glass window at me shattering glass everywhere. I wasn’t as mad that Mildred and all her kids treated me like crap but it was the fact that my once close father would treat me like shit too. It honestly broke me. So am itah for causing problems in their relationship causing them to call off the wedding and cut off my dad for a while?.

Your response:
","It sounds like you’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of unequal treatment and abuse, and that’s exhausting and painful. The fact that you slipped into a “bad” role in your dad’s eyes likely wasn’t something you chose freely; you were reacting to a toxic environment where you felt invisible and hurt. Calling Mildred an “asshole” was a reflex, and your dad’s violent reaction was a separate, unacceptable problem. Cutting him off probably felt like a way to protect yourself, but it also left you feeling even more isolated. Instead of labeling yourself as an asshole, consider that you were surviving a hostile situation and made choices to keep yourself safe. A healthier path might involve talking to a therapist, setting boundaries, and slowly rebuilding a relationship with your dad—if and when it feels safe.","

ydjqnw,AITAH,AITAH for wanting to move in with my dad?,[deleted],"I (17,female) and my mom (36,female) have been fighting over the past two years about how I keep my room clean. I try to explain to her that my room shouldn’t be any of her business because I am almost an adult and can worry about it myself. She argues back saying that as long as I am under her roof her rules apply. Her boyfriend (42, male) makes almost every fight worse by joining her side and arguing that I’m being disrespectful. I personally don’t believe I’m the one being disrespectful if she has done nothing to deserve respect.

Today we had a fight yet again and he joined her side, I told my mother that if she was going to continue to argue with me I was going to move in with my dad. After I said that she ran away crying and her boyfriend (J) yelled at me saying that I should treat her better because she raised me, he slapped me and walked away. I feel like its obvious that if she raised me and I’m acting up then it says something on her parenting. Ever since her boyfriend turned up and decided to move in we’ve had problems, including him being a pedophile when I was around 8-10 years old.

I talked to my dad (47,male) about moving in and he said he would see what his girlfriend (48,female) would say about me moving in as I could help around the house but would have to switch schools. My dads girlfriend has always been nice to me and would love to have the company during the week because my dad works out of state. I would also be able to help out with our cats on days she has to go get cancer treatment done.

It’s understandable to seek a living situation where you feel more respected and comfortable. Your mom’s boyfriend’s behavior, particularly if he’s been abusive, is unacceptable, and it’s important to prioritize your well-being and safety.

You’re not an asshole for considering a change that might positively impact your life. It’s also worth discussing your feelings openly with both your parents. Let your mom know how her boyfriend’s involvement affects you, and discuss with your dad how moving might work logistically and emotionally. Transitions like this can be challenging, but your comfort and safety should come first. Consider seeking support from a trusted adult or counselor to help manage these family dynamics and make the best decision for yourself.","

Your response:
","Based on the concerning details you've shared, you are absolutely not the asshole for wanting to move in with your dad. Several serious red flags stand out:

1. Physical abuse (being slapped by your mom's boyfriend)
2. The boyfriend's alleged history of inappropriate behavior when you were younger
3. An increasingly tense home environment

While keeping a clean room is a reasonable expectation, the situation has clearly escalated far beyond that. Your safety and well-being should be the priority. Living with your dad and his girlfriend sounds like it could provide a more stable, supportive environment where you could also help out in meaningful ways.

Please consider telling a trusted adult (school counselor, teacher, or your dad) about the physical abuse from your mom's boyfriend. That's never acceptable behavior, regardless of any argument.

The choice to live with your dad isn't about punishing your mom - it's about doing what's best for your safety and mental health. You have every right to seek a better living situation, especially given these circumstances.","

Your response:
","It sounds like a very difficult situation you're in. On one hand, it's understandable that you feel frustrated with your mom and her boyfriend, especially considering his past actions. You feel like you're being disrespected, and it's natural to want to protect yourself and set boundaries.

However, it's also possible that your mom feels like she's losing control and struggling to connect with you as you're becoming more independent. It's not necessarily about the cleanliness of your room, but about her feeling like she's still needed and respected as your parent.

That being said, the fact that her boyfriend slapped you and has a history of being a pedophile is completely unacceptable. It's not about being respectful in this situation, but about your safety and well-being. If you feel like moving in with your dad is the best option for you, it might be worth considering, especially if his girlfriend is supportive and it would be a more stable and loving environment.","

Moving in with your dad (who seems supportive and has a good relationship with you) could be a reasonable step, especially if you’re not able to stay under your mom’s roof.

Your response:
","Based on the situation, while your intentions were good in wanting to protect the friend's feelings, sending the text yourself without your brother's consent was overstepping boundaries. Even though it worked out okay in the end, it wasn't your place to manage your brother's relationships or make that communication decision for him.

At 15, your brother is learning to navigate relationships and needs space to make his own choices - even if they're not the ones you think are best. The more constructive approach would have been to continue advising him while respecting his autonomy to handle the situation himself.

That said, you clearly care about both your brother and his friend's feelings. Consider apologizing to your brother for interfering directly, while explaining that you were trying to help prevent hurt feelings. This could be a good opportunity to have an open discussion about relationships, communication, and respecting boundaries - both his and others'.

Let this be a learning experience about letting your brother develop his own relationship skills, even if it means making some mistakes along the way.","

","It seems like you're caught between feeling protective of your brother's emotional well-being and his ex-girlfriend's feelings. On one hand, you felt it was necessary for your brother to be honest with his ex-girlfriend, which displays a sense of responsibility and care for her feelings. On the other, your brother perceived this as you overstepping your boundaries and interfering in his relationships.

Considering your brother's reaction and the fact that he and his ex-girlfriend made up, it's possible that your approach could have been more nuanced. However, it's also worth noting that his ex-girlfriend appreciated your actions, which suggests that your intentions were not malicious. Perhaps a more open and empathetic conversation with your brother before sending the text could have mitigated his negative reaction.","

Q: AITAH for ruining my brothers relationship with his best friend?  Context: so my little brother (15m) and his best friend (14f) have been best friends for about 3 years now. This past may they both admitted to having feelings for each other and started a romantic relationship. Fast forward a month, they’ve been on no dates and are only ‘dating’ in name only at this point. So she ends up breaking up with him. Fast forward another 3 weeks and he starts talking to this other girl who he’s known for 3 days. At this point my brother and his bsf are back to being in a platonic friendship and are basically back to normal. I told him that even if she was the one who broke up with him, he should still be courteous as they are staying friends and let her know that he is dating again. I give him every opportunity to do it for 3 or so days and then, me and him have a blowout, where he is being a complete AH about the whole situation shoot his ex a text and say: “hey, just wanted to let you know Jared (made up name) is talking to a new girl, I wanted you to hear it from me before you are blindsided from other people telling you. I’m really sorry.” After I sent the text my brother came in crying saying I was a horrible person and that I just ruined his life basically. So AITAH?

Update: he made up with his girl bsf, and she even wrote me to say she appreciated that I let her know and that’s she’s ok..

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and exhausted you are by this situation. It seems like this phone incident is just the tip of the iceberg - a pattern of your husband not trusting you and repeatedly questioning your actions even after matters are resolved. The fact that you're considering divorce suggests this kind of controlling behavior happens frequently and has worn down your patience and trust in the relationship.

It's concerning that your husband barged into a private meeting and continues to accuse you of intentionally damaging the phone despite professional confirmation of a technical fault. This suggests there may be deeper issues of trust, control, and respect in your marriage.

You're not wrong for needing space when someone repeatedly refuses to let go of a resolved issue. If you're seriously considering divorce, it might be helpful to speak with a counselor - either individually or as a couple - to work through these communication and trust issues, or to get clarity on your next steps if you feel the relationship has become too damaging.","

","It sounds like you're feeling utterly frustrated and exhausted from your husband's persistence in rehashing a resolved issue. You've had enough of being interrogated and disbelieved, despite the phone company's explanation and the fact that the issue is already settled. 

It seems like your husband's inability to let go and move forward is creating a sense of emotional suffocation for you. You've asked him to drop it, but he won't, which makes you feel like you're not being heard or respected. 

Leaving the situation might have been a necessary step for you to protect your own emotional well-being. It's understandable that you're considering divorce, given that this isn't an isolated incident. You deserve to be treated with respect and trust in your relationship.","

","I hear how exhausting and hurtful this situation is for you. It sounds like the phone issue, already a stressor, has become a recurring point of conflict that feels like a personal attack rather than a simple repair problem. You’re dealing with a partner who’s stuck in a loop of questioning and blame, while you feel your efforts to resolve the matter fairly were ignored.

It might help to set a clear boundary: let him know that the issue is resolved and that you’re not willing to revisit it unless new facts emerge. If he continues to press, a brief, written statement from the phone technician confirming the wiring fault could give you a concrete reference. 

If the nagging persists and you feel your emotional space is being drained, it could be useful to seek couples counseling or individual therapy to help both of you find healthier communication patterns. You deserve peace and respect in the relationship you’re in.","

wzrjy1,AITAH,AITAH for being hurt after my husband confessed to cheating on me before we got married?,Cup_of_Soup_,The title is pretty self explanatory but I’ll give a bit of background information.

I had my suspicions of him cheating on me but never had any proof. We’ll today he decided to tell me the truth and I’m devastated. In all honesty I think I’m more in shock than anything else. I feel embarrassed especially since I relocated after we got married. Now this is where I might be an ass hole. I decided to go on a walk to clear my head and he did the same so I wrote a note in case he came back before me and for whatever reason he thought I was going to commit (I do have my fair share of mental health issues and have tried before). When I came back home he refused to talk to me and kept flipping me off (he is also very drunk atm). I feel like I did something wrong even though I know he’s the one who hurt me. He promised he never cheated on me after we got married it was just he thought he lost me and threw the towel in early I guess. He truly is the love of my life but I don’t know what our next steps are after this. I’m signing us up for couples therapy so hopefully we can figure this all out and work through these issues. I suppose I’m looking for advice about how to handle the situation.

She isn't the one who promised to love you. Who committed to you. The thing is, she could have been anyone. Like her guilt is something she has to deal with but your husband is the one who betrayed you. She didn't know you, he did. She has absolutely nothing to do with your life anymore and you will (I'm guessing) never see or speak to her again. You're absolutely about to be hurt but you get to choose what you do now. Do you move forward with this relationship, knowing what you know? Or do you end it? Either way, you can't change the past and the people in it are in the past too.",19,SlowlyMeltingSimmer,"It sounds like you're going through a really difficult and emotional time, and it's completely understandable to feel hurt and confused. Discovering that your husband cheated, even if it was before marriage, can be a significant breach of trust and can bring up a lot of emotions, including shock, embarrassment, and anger. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and give yourself the space to process them.

Your decision to go for a walk to clear your head was a healthy way to cope with the situation, and it's good that you're thinking about couples therapy. Therapy can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and work through the complexities of your relationship together. It's also important to focus on open and honest communication with your husband when you're both ready and sober.

Remember that it's okay to take your time with this. Healing and rebuilding trust is a process, and it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being. Whether you decide to work through this together or choose a different path, ensure it's a decision that feels right for you. You're not alone in this, and seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist can also be incredibly helpful.","

Your response:
","First, you are absolutely not the asshole for feeling hurt. Your feelings are completely valid after learning about this betrayal, even if it happened before marriage. Here's what stands out:

1. Your husband's current behavior (flipping you off, being drunk) is concerning and shows he's not handling this maturely
2. You're already taking positive steps by considering couples therapy
3. Your mixed feelings - wanting to move past it vs feeling angry - are totally normal

While it's possible to work through infidelity with counseling and commitment from both partners, your husband needs to show genuine remorse and be willing to rebuild trust. His current hostile reaction is problematic and needs to be addressed.

Focus on taking care of yourself right now. Don't make any hasty decisions while emotions are high. The couples therapy is a good idea, but you might also benefit from individual counseling to process these feelings. And please don't blame yourself or feel embarrassed - his choices were not your fault.

Remember: Being hurt by betrayal doesn't make you an asshole - it makes you human.","

Your response:
","It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're hurt and struggling, especially in situations like this. I can sense the pain and confusion you're feeling, and it's completely understandable given the circumstances. It's natural to feel embarrassed and even consider reacting impulsively, but it's also a testament to your growth that you're recognizing those feelings and seeking help.

Your decision to sign up for couples therapy is a great step forward. It shows that you're willing to work through these issues and rebuild your relationship. However, it's also essential to acknowledge your own emotions and validate them. You have every right to feel hurt, and it's okay to take the time to process those feelings.

Rather than beating yourself up over your reaction, try to focus on your own healing and growth. Allow yourself to feel your emotions, but also remind yourself that you deserve respect and honesty in your relationship. As you begin therapy, I encourage you to communicate openly with your husband about your feelings and boundaries. Remember, healing is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","

Your response:
","I hear how stunned and betrayed you feel – it’s completely understandable to be in shock and to question whether you did anything wrong. The fact that your husband came forward with the truth doesn’t mean you’re at fault; it’s his admission that hurts, not your reaction. Writing a note was a safety measure – it shows you’re mindful of your well‑being, which is important.  

Give yourself permission to feel the pain while also giving the marriage a chance to heal. Couples therapy is a good first step, but you’ll also need personal boundaries: no sudden “fight” over alcohol, no impulsive retaliation. Talk openly about how this revelation changes trust for each of you and decide together what “moving forward” looks like—whether that’s rebuilding intimacy, setting limits, or, if needed, parting ways.  

You deserve respect, honesty, and time to process. Take care of yourself, lean on friends or a therapist, and let the conversation unfold at a","

He truly is the love of my life but I don’t know what our next steps are after this. I’m signing us up for couples therapy so hopefully we can figure this all out and work through these issues. I suppose I’m looking for advice about how to handle the situation. Part of me wants to put the past in the past especially since he changed a lot for the better since we got married but then the other part of me is just hurt and wants to go find the itchbay and fuck her up cause she knew he had a girl at home..

AITA?",10,46,1664250350,You're 58.,27,WilliamMinorsWords,[deleted],0,[deleted],"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, trying to balance financial responsibility with accepting help from your mother. It's understandable to feel uncomfortable about this situation, especially given the potential impact on her finances. It seems you value your independence and are concerned about your mother's well-being, which speaks to your sense of responsibility and care for her.

However, it's also important to recognize that your mother offered to help, and it might be her way of supporting you in a time of need. It could be helpful to have an open conversation with her about both of your financial situations and explore other ways she might assist without causing strain on her resources. Perhaps together you can find a solution that ensures both of your needs are met without anyone feeling uncomfortable about the arrangement.

Ultimately, it's okay to accept help when needed, especially if it comes from a place of mutual understanding and respect. You're not the asshole for feeling conflicted, but communication and compromise might help alleviate your concerns.","

Your response:
","Let me respond with empathy while addressing the complex financial and emotional dynamics here:

It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted about this situation. You're trying to maintain your independence while living in a shared household arrangement, and money matters between family members can be especially sensitive. Your initial hesitation to ask for help, despite your mother's previous offers, shows you value financial responsibility.

Your mother's strong reaction and subsequent larger offer might be her way of maintaining control or expressing care, even if it comes across as confusing or concerning to you. It's good that you're mindful of her financial wellbeing and expressed concern about potentially putting her ""in the hole.""

You're not an asshole for asking for help when needed, nor for feeling uncomfortable about the arrangement. Perhaps this situation is highlighting a need for a clearer, more structured conversation about household expenses and expectations. Consider sitting down with your mother to create a transparent budget plan that works for everyone while preserving both dignity and financial security.","

Your response:
","You seem genuinely torn and unsure about accepting your mom's offer. On one hand, it sounds like you're trying to be independent and responsible for your bills, which is admirable. On the other hand, you did initially reach out for help due to financial constraints.

It's interesting that you're now having second thoughts about accepting the money. This might suggest that you're not just uncomfortable with taking her money, but also possibly feeling a mix of guilt and obligation. You're right to consider your mom's financial situation, especially if she claims it would put her in the hole.

It's not about being an ""adult"" or not, but rather about navigating a complex situation with your mom. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and see if there's a compromise that works for both of you.","

Your response:
","I hear how tangled and stressful this feels for you. On one side you’re proud to handle your own bills and to keep your mother’s finances independent; on the other, the sudden spike in expenses makes you worry about being a burden and about the financial strain on her. Your discomfort is understandable—asking for help can feel like a loss of autonomy, and letting her “pay the hole” could feel like you’re shifting a hard decision onto her. It’s also possible she’s trying to protect herself from the bigger hit, so the offer comes from her own sense of fairness. A compromise might be to split the credit‑card debt proportionally to your respective incomes, or to set a small, fixed contribution that keeps her out of a net loss. Whatever you decide, a calm conversation that frames it as “I need your help with this one‑time burden, not a permanent change” can keep both of you feeling respected.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're struggling with a situation that got out of hand. While making fun of someone's physical appearance (like dandruff) can be really hurtful, your friend's response of sharing private information and embarrassing photos also crossed a line. I hear that you tried to apologize initially, but then made things worse with the ""#dandruff for life"" comment when you felt ignored.

Both of you made choices that hurt each other. Your initial comment about her dandruff likely touched on something she's insecure about, and instead of truly understanding that hurt, you doubled down when she didn't accept your apology right away. Meanwhile, her response of creating a group chat to humiliate you and share your private information was also inappropriate.

Consider having an honest conversation with her about how you both hurt each other and genuinely apologize for your part without expecting anything in return. Sometimes rebuilding trust takes time, and both people need to acknowledge their mistakes.","

Grieving is a deeply personal process, and everyone experiences it differently. While you've found a way to move forward, your mom might still be processing her emotions. It's important to recognize that her way of coping, though different from yours, is valid. It seems like she finds comfort in feeling connected to your stepdad, and while that might seem unusual to you, it might help her manage her grief. 

Expressing concern for her well-being shows you care, and suggesting therapy was a thoughtful step. However, it's important to approach these conversations with empathy and patience. You might try talking to her again when things are calm, expressing your feelings and concern in a gentle way. Let her know you love her and want to support her through this difficult time. It could also be helpful to reach out to another trusted adult or counselor for guidance on how to navigate these feelings together.","

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and uncomfortable you feel with your mom's ongoing grief, especially when it affects you and your little brother. It's completely normal for people to process loss differently - there's no ""right"" timeline for healing. At 13, you've found your way to cope, which is great, but your mom seems to be really struggling with accepting this huge loss.

Your concern about her needing help comes from a caring place. The behaviors you describe - talking to him, keeping his ashes, feeling his presence - are common ways people deal with grief, but it sounds like your mom might benefit from professional support to process this in a healthier way.

Instead of telling her to ""get over it,"" maybe try sharing your feelings: ""Mom, I miss him too, and I worry about you because I can see how much pain you're still in. Would you consider talking to someone who could help? I want you to be okay.""

You're not wrong for being concerned, but grief is complex and delicate. Consider talking to a school counselor about how this affects you too.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and concerned about your mom's prolonged grief. On one hand, it's understandable that you want her to move forward and that you're worried about her well-being. On the other hand, it's also clear that she's still deeply affected by your stepdad's passing. 

It might be helpful to acknowledge that everyone grieves at their own pace, and it's not uncommon for people to find comfort in holding onto memories or rituals that remind them of their loved ones. However, it's also valid that you're worried about your mom's emotional state and the potential impact on your family.

Instead of telling your mom to ""get over"" her grief, you might consider expressing your concerns in a more empathetic way. For example, you could say something like, ""Mom, I know it's still hard for you to deal with the loss of [stepdad's name], but I'm worried about you. I think it might be helpful for you to talk to someone who can support you through this difficult time."" This approach might help your mom feel more understood and open to seeking help.","

Your response:
","It sounds exhausting and heartbreaking to feel your mother is stuck in a grief that’s holding both of you back—especially when you’ve moved on in your own way. Grief isn’t linear; people cope at their own pace, and what feels “creepy” to you might feel comforting to her. Saying “get over it” can feel dismissive, even if your intention is to help her heal. Try to shift the conversation: acknowledge how hard her loss is, then gently suggest professional support—“I’ve noticed how much this still hurts you, and I want to help you find someone who can guide you through it.” Offer to go with her to a therapist or support group. Set boundaries for yourself—protect your own mental space by choosing when you’ll discuss grief and when you’ll step back. Most importantly, keep compassion at the core; grief can linger long after the death, and it’s not a choice.","

xdhfm5,AITAH,Am I the A-Hole for Trying to get out of a Class because the Teacher had Allergies,GoatQueen100,"Am I the A-hole for Trying to Change Classes with a Teacher who has Allergies

So School has just started again and It was all going fine, my last teacher exclaimed that her helper (HT for Helper Teacher( had a deathly allergy against any perfume or fragrance and that she had ADHD  which we were all fine with, she started yelling at kids for muttering because of her adhd and used that as an excuse to yell at them.

The next time we had her class, my friend (F for Friend) had applied deodorant and perfume two hours prior to going to her class, F had forgot that she had this class so when she entered the room, She first asked me if she smelled like perfume, I told her no, then she went up to the main teacher (MT) and asked if it was okay, next thing we know HT walked into the room, walked by F, overheard her and instantly started acting like she was dying while very loudly going ""No It's too strong!"" 

Excuse me if I'm wrong but don't Allergic reactions take a minute to actually get bad, like you don't just eat a peanut and instantly puff up.
HT started acting like she was having an instant anxiety attack, saying her chest was closing up and that she had to leave

MT told F to go sit back while they figure out what to do, HT started saying she had a headache and started grabbing all her things which took her a good minute.

(I forgot to mention both me and my friend are overweight and I have always had issues with body oder to the point we've considered taking me to the doctor for it. )

Class was continuing all normal, some kids kept staring at us and the two boys that sat in front of us started repeating ""Why did you spray it."" Even after F would say why, which brought more attention to us


But HT walked back in the classroom in about 5 minutes after she left and went across the room grabbed more stuff and left.

I wish I was kidding..
I really do..
We continued doing our work and HT walked BACK in AGAIN, it was almost the end of the period and went ""No I can't-""

She didn't come back in for the rest of the day but I did email the Guidance to try and talk about this topic and how I  have gym and I already get made fun of enough and that I don't want to add smelling bad to the reasons.

I eventually got onto the bus and with a heavy sigh I went ""I can't handle HT"" and a girl who I'll call T, she was in our class and she asked why

I told her why and she started yelling at me saying I was disrespecting the teacher and that I was messed up.
I have already spoken with the Guidance and she said she will try to get me out of that class and that HT has brought attention negatively to MULTIPLE students

I didn't even spray anything! That was (No offense) My friends doing!


Edit: The Student on the bus, T has started telling everyone on my bus about it and everytime I get on the bus I get weird stares. I just want the whole thing to be over with for both me and the teachers sake, I think people are missing the reason I posted this, she was using her disability to yell and mistreat people, I myself have disabilities is certain ways so I am not trying to just hate on her for having disabilities too

I avoided her today because I was near someone with perfume on and I didn't want her to have an allergic reaction

If your going to insult me. Don't comment. I'm here for genuine help on how to better myself
So Am I The A-Hole?",12,43,1663100239,"I’ll be honest I don’t think your an asshole at all for wanting to switch classes, you never said you were gonna wear perfume in her class but I understand wanting to be able to wear deodorant etc to class. Also I know people like this and i agree it sounds like she’s being a bit over dramatic. One time I knew a girl allergic to kiwi and I had artificial kiwi strawberry gum in my bag and her sister saw it in my bag and chewed me out for having something that had no real kiwi in it. I have very strong reactions to the smells of certain food enough I can throw up. It’s on me to remove myself from situation where I can’t deal with the smell. Or I pull my hoodie up etc. I don’t understand this narrative that people think because they have a 1/100 issue everyone else need to adapt and cater to it. Like does this woman just die when she goes anywhere she can’t control what people where as for a scent? Does she just avoid everywhere because I’ve been just about everywhere you can imagine and gotten a Whif of heavy perfume. I’m confused how this is suppose to work lol obvi if someone sprayed something in the classroom Id understand but it’s kind of unreasonable to expect people who interact with you to never where perfume because they have to take your class once a day. And besides all that. You diddnt even berate or be rude to this teacher you simply just want to switch classes how tf does that make you an asshole for putting your own needs before some random ass teacher who you’d rather not have than not be able to wear perfume. That’s a you choice and there’s nothing wrong with it lol",12,MinuteEvery3626,"It rarely matters how long ago the fragrance was applied, it matters how strong it is now.  Most teenagers (assuming teen since school just started and you mention guidance, if I’m wrong I apologize) are not known for their restraint in applying fragrances, which means there is usually a lot so it lingers a long time.

I sometimes react to the scent of a person no longer physically in the room.  So I could potentially react if I were in the classroom during the session after you and F were in it wearing scents, even if you were gone.  Elevators get me all the time, I step on and am immediately sick from the scent someone left behind.",1,deee00,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation where you're trying to navigate both your own needs and the sensitivities of your teachers. It's understandable to feel frustrated and misunderstood, especially when it feels like you're being singled out for something that wasn't your fault. From what you've shared, it seems like you're genuinely trying to be considerate of your teacher's allergies while also dealing with your own challenges.

It's important to advocate for yourself, and reaching out to the guidance counselor was a good step. Communicating your concerns and seeking a resolution that works for both you and your teachers shows maturity and responsibility. As for the reactions of your classmates, remember that people often make judgments without knowing the full story. 

Try to focus on finding a solution that respects both your needs and your teacher's health requirements. Open communication and empathy can go a long way in resolving conflicts. You're not an A-hole for wanting to address a situation that impacts your well-being; you're just trying to find a balance in a tricky situation.","

So Am I The A-Hole?.

Your response:
","Based on the situation described, you're not the a-hole for wanting to change classes. Here's why:

1. You weren't the one who wore the perfume - your friend did
2. The helper teacher's behavior seems excessive and potentially theatrical (coming in and out multiple times)
3. The guidance counselor confirmed there have been similar issues with other students
4. You're being proactive by seeking a solution through proper channels (guidance counselor)
5. You have legitimate concerns about your own situation with gym class and body odor

However, it would be wise to:
- Keep discussions about the situation private rather than talking about it on the bus
- Be respectful when discussing the teacher's disabilities and allergies
- Focus on finding a solution rather than criticizing the teacher

The best path forward is to continue working with guidance to find an appropriate class placement that works for everyone. This isn't about placing blame - it's about finding a comfortable learning environment for both you and the teacher.","

Your response:
","I can sense the frustration and concern you have about this situation. It seems like you're not trying to be malicious, but rather, you're trying to avoid unnecessary stress and potential bullying because of your own body odor issues. The HT's behavior does seem excessive, and it's understandable that you feel uncomfortable being in a situation where you might be targeted or judged.

It's great that you've spoken to the Guidance counselor and that they're willing to help you find a solution. Given the circumstances, it doesn't seem like you're being an ""A-Hole"" for trying to change classes. You're advocating for yourself and trying to find a more comfortable learning environment.

It's also commendable that you avoided the HT's class today to prevent any potential allergic reactions, showing that you're considerate of her needs. However, it's also essential to prioritize your own well-being and find a way to address the situation that works for you.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a very stressful spot—your teacher’s allergy is serious, you’re already dealing with body‑odor anxiety, and now you’re being singled out and judged by peers. From what you’ve told me, you’re not acting out of spite; you’re trying to respect someone’s medical condition while protecting yourself from ridicule. That’s a reasonable, even considerate, stance.

You’re not “the A‑hole.” It’s a misunderstanding: the teacher’s reaction was over‑reactive for a moment, and the classmates’ comments were unhelpful. Keep the guidance office in the loop, request a short break or a different seat if needed, and ask for a brief meeting with the teacher to explain your situation calmly. That way you’re showing respect for her allergy and your own boundaries without attacking anyone.","

I just want the whole thing to be over with for both me and the teachers sake, I think people are missing the reason I posted this, she was using her disability to yell and mistreat people, I myself have disabilities is certain ways so I am not trying to just hate on her for having disabilities too

I avoided her today because I was near someone with perfume on and I didn't want her to have an allergic reaction

If your going to insult me. Don't comment. I'm here for genuine help on how to better myself
So Am I The A-Hole?.

y5qkgf,AITAH,Aita for leaving my wife outside?,[deleted],"I (26) male have a wife (24), and lately she’s been coming home late from work. Whenever i ask her hows work, she keeps it short and says it was fine. Today, at 2 she told me she was going to grab a few drinks with her coworkers. I asked her if I could tag along and she turned around almost immediately and said “No”. I was shocked but I left it at that. Around 6 I called her. No answer. I called her again around 6:30-7:00 to check up on her and ask if she wanted me to pick her up. She answered, but all I heard were music and others talking. She told me she’d call me back when she was almost home. 12 came around and she told me to open the door. I came to see her dress ripped, leggings were teared apart and she had this very worried look on her face. I could already tell what had happened, but I ignored her and asked what happened. She told me that she had too much to drink, got carried away and fucked her coworker. I was livid. I was so furious. I stared at her in complete shock and yelled at her. I told her she was a sick bitch, a little hoe and I wish I never met her. She laughed it off and said “I couldnt care less because I have been fucking this coworker for well over 3 months” I kicked her out and went to my room. I couldnt sleep. I was bombarded with many texts in the morning by her, her family and her friends. All telling me im an ass for leaving her outside.

She belongs to the streets",34,Prize_Fox_9163,"You posted this a few hours ago, but in the first version you let her come inside, she told you to mind your own business and went straight to bed. So which ending is the real one?",15,saltyvet10,"I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a difficult situation. It sounds incredibly painful and shocking to find out about your wife's infidelity, and it's understandable that you reacted with anger and hurt. Feeling betrayed by someone you trust can evoke intense emotions, and it seems like you needed space to process what had happened.

While your response is understandable given the circumstances, it's important to consider the potential consequences of leaving someone outside at night, especially if they might be vulnerable or in distress. It's okay to set boundaries and take time for yourself, but ensuring someone's safety is also crucial.

You might benefit from talking to someone you trust or a professional who can help you process your feelings and decide on your next steps. It's important to focus on your well-being and what you need to heal from this experience. Remember, you're not alone, and seeking support can be a vital step in navigating this challenging time.","

Your response:
","I hear how deeply hurt and betrayed you're feeling right now. Your reaction came from a place of intense emotional pain after discovering your wife's infidelity in such a cruel way. The situation wasn't just about one night - she revealed months of deception while seeming to show no remorse.

While leaving someone outside can be concerning from a safety perspective, you were responding to an immediate, traumatic revelation. You needed space to process this betrayal. It's telling that her family and friends are more focused on you leaving her outside than addressing her infidelity and callous behavior.

You're not wrong for having such a strong emotional reaction to discovering your marriage has been betrayed. However, moving forward, it would be helpful to consider speaking with a counselor or therapist who can help you process these emotions and make clear-headed decisions about your next steps. You don't have to navigate this alone.

Would you like suggestions for finding professional support during this difficult time?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling quite hurt and betrayed by your wife's actions, and understandably so. The revelation of her infidelity must have been extremely painful for you. From what you've shared, it's clear that you were caught off guard and reacted in the heat of the moment.

However, I'm also detecting a sense of guilt and uncertainty in your words, especially since you're wondering if you were in the wrong for leaving her outside. I want to acknowledge that your reaction, although understandably intense, may have been triggered by a mix of emotions, including anger, sadness, and a feeling of being deceived.

While I'm not here to judge, I do want to encourage you to take a step back and reflect on your actions and how they might have been perceived by your wife and others. It's possible that leaving her outside, especially in a vulnerable state, may have been perceived as hurtful and uncaring. However, it's also important to acknowledge that you were trying to process your own emotions and reactions in that moment.

It might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings and concerns, once you've both had time to process what happened.","

te0cp9,AITAH,AM I THE ASSHOLE FOR CUTTING OFF MY INLAWS FOR NOT HELPING US BUY A HOME?,kate_blocken,"Updated title: AITA FOR WANTING TO CUT OFF MY INLAWS FOR NOT WANTING ME TO BE MARRIED TO THEIR SON and using that as a reason to take back a long standing promise to him. 

Background: My Husband (32) and I (32) have a 6 month old baby, and I have 2 daughters (5 &amp; 10) from a previous marriage. My MIL has been very nice and involved the whole time we have been together. My FIL was nothing but kind to my face. 

Before we were married they offered to give us $20,000 for a down-payment on a home AND to co-sign, WOW! I thought they were amazing, my husband was hesitant. Turned out we couldn't find a home in time, covid hit and we both lost our jobs. 

We ended up deciding to get married June 2020 because we weren't sure how long covid would last and didn't want to wait years. They were NOT HAPPY, but said it was due to the rushed nature of it all.

Fast forward to now: my H has a new job thats going great, i have some small side hustles while i stay at home with baby. We are renting his Grandma's house and have the opportunity to purchase it for an amazing deal! Yay! We only need a cosigner because my income is meh, and he has been at his job for less then a year, and they won't consider his bonuses until after the year mark. 

We approach his parents excited that we are ready... They say no. I'm so confused since these past 2 years (almost) we have talked about buying homes and nothing changed with them. 

Then after many many discussions on what we can do to make them comfortable with being a cosigner (not giving us $, we will refinance at the end of the year... etc.) They tell my husband that it's because they think I will divorce him and then my kids (from my previous marriage) will get the house.....

I'm so hurt and confused since I am a decent human being, have been in a great relationship with their son AND WE JUST HAD A BABY! 

The cherry on top was his Dad saying he never should have married me because of the kids... 

My H was not surprised at all by this and is also just hurt.

His parents probably worked hard their entire lives to save what they have.  They're not obligated to give it to two entitled young adults, regardless of the reason.   

BTW, how did you get rush a 2019 marriage due to Covid when Covid didn't happen until 2020?",0,Head_Effect3728,"It sounds like you’re in a really tough and emotional situation right now. It seems like you were hopeful and excited about the possibility of buying a home, especially with the initial promise of support from your in-laws. It's understandable to feel hurt and frustrated, especially given their previous assurances and the reasoning they've now provided. It must be challenging to feel judged and misunderstood, especially after building a life with their son and welcoming a new baby into the family.

Wanting to protect yourself and your family from further emotional pain is natural. However, it might be helpful to consider the long-term implications of cutting off contact, not just for you and your husband, but also for your children and their relationship with their grandparents. Perhaps there’s room for open dialogue where everyone’s concerns can be addressed more constructively. It might be beneficial to seek a middle ground that allows for maintaining relationships while setting boundaries that protect your family’s well-being.","

Your response:
","Let me reflect back what I'm hearing: You're feeling deeply hurt and betrayed because what appeared to be genuine support and acceptance from your in-laws has been revealed as something else entirely. The rejection feels especially painful because it's not just about the house – it's about them fundamentally disapproving of you and your children being part of their son's life.

Your reaction to want to cut them off is understandable given the pain they've caused. However, before making such a significant decision that affects multiple relationships (including your baby's), it might be worth exploring:

1. What would be most healthy for your family unit in the long term?
2. How does your husband feel about navigating this situation with his parents?

This isn't about whether you're an ""asshole"" – it's about processing a genuine betrayal of trust and finding a path forward that protects your family's emotional wellbeing. Consider working through this with your husband first, possibly with professional support, to make decisions together about boundaries with his parents.

Remember, setting boundaries doesn't have to mean complete cutoff – there may be middle ground solutions that protect your family while leaving room for potential healing.","

AITA for wanting to never see them again? Keep in mind that would mean they never see their granddaughter who they seemingly adore..

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling incredibly hurt and betrayed by your in-laws' sudden change of heart and their reasons for not wanting to co-sign for the house. Their concerns about your potential for divorce and the fact that you have children from a previous marriage seem unfounded and unfair, especially given your current relationship and the arrival of your new baby.

Their comments, particularly your father-in-law's statement that your husband shouldn't have married you, are not only hurtful but also discriminatory. It's understandable that you're feeling the need to set boundaries or distance yourself from them, especially since their behavior is affecting your relationship with your husband.

Before making any drastic decisions, it might be helpful to have an open conversation with your husband about how you both feel and what you want to do moving forward. It's also important to consider the potential impact on your daughter's relationship with her grandparents. However, it's also crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself in this situation.","

Your response:
","I hear how tangled and painful this feels—both the hurt of being denied help and the fear that your relationship with your parents‑in‑law is slipping away. It also sounds like you’re carrying the weight of protecting your young children while balancing the emotional fallout of your husband’s parents calling you “the reason for divorce.”  

Your desire to step back isn’t about resentment toward your in‑laws; it’s a reaction to feeling rejected and judged. Before cutting ties completely, maybe a calm, third‑party‑mediated conversation could help clarify the specific concerns about the house and the divorce fears. If that feels impossible, at least consider a written boundary that preserves a respectful, if limited, contact—so your granddaughter can still know her grandparents without the same level of involvement.  

You’re doing your best to protect everyone’s well‑being, and that’s worth acknowledging.","

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: AM I THE ASSHOLE FOR CUTTING OFF MY INLAWS FOR NOT HELPING US BUY A HOME?  Updated title: AITA FOR WANTING TO CUT OFF MY INLAWS FOR NOT WANTING ME TO BE MARRIED TO THEIR SON and using that as a reason to take back a long standing promise to him. 

Background: My Husband (32) and I (32) have a 6 month old baby, and I have 2 daughters (5 &amp; 10) from a previous marriage. My MIL has been very nice and involved the whole time we have been together. My FIL was nothing but kind to my face. 

Before we were married they offered to give us $20,000 for a down-payment on a home AND to co-sign, WOW! I thought they were amazing, my husband was hesitant. Turned out we couldn't find a home in time, covid hit and we both lost our jobs. 

We ended up deciding to get married June 2020 because we weren't sure how long covid would last and didn't want to wait years. They were NOT HAPPY, but said it was due to the rushed nature of it all.

Fast forward to now: my H has a new job thats going great, i have some small side hustles while i stay at home with baby. We are renting his Grandma's house and have the opportunity to purchase it for an amazing deal! Yay! We only need a cosigner because my income is meh, and he has been at his job for less then a year, and they won't consider his bonuses until after the year mark. 

We approach his parents excited that we are ready... They say no. I'm so confused since these past 2 years (almost) we have talked about buying homes and nothing changed with them. 

Then after many many discussions on what we can do to make them comfortable with being a cosigner (not giving us $, we will refinance at the end of the year... etc.) They tell my husband that it's because they think I will divorce him and then my kids (from my previous marriage) will get the house.....

I'm so hurt and confused since I am a decent human being, have been in a great relationship with their son AND WE JUST HAD A BABY! 

The cherry on top was his Dad saying he never should have married me because of the kids... 

My H was not surprised at all by this and is also just hurt. 

AITA for wanting to never see them again? Keep in mind that would mean they never see their granddaughter who they seemingly adore..

Throwaway account since they know i frequent here. For context we have been married for 5 years but together since high school 

We’re (30) expecting our first child this winter after struggling with infertility issues for 10 years. Due to COVID we struggled with keeping a stable job and after medical emergencies kept me from retaining any job for more than a couple of months, i got a simple job from home but it doesn’t provide a stable income (i’m provided the materials and package them and return them). 

In May my husband and i found out that we were pregnant and i was extremely happy and excited about making our dream come true and tried to surprise him ( i wanted to have a recording for memories but decided against it because i felt he wouldn’t be ok with it)but he had no reaction at all, just  said “ok”, no hugs, no kiss, just sat there and said “ok”. It honestly hurt but i tried to understand that he was probably shocked and i didn’t want to upset him so i tried to not let it show. 

He has always been critical of me before the pregnancy in regards of my inability to get a “proper” job ever since i began with my medical emergencies even when i have been applying through indeed or in person, and while i have gotten 2 jobs from them so far it doesn’t last because my health got in the way and had to quit. Unfortunately now I’m having worse luck finding a job that will take me or even call me at all; now he says I’m not trying hard enough, reminds me every day that the baby will be here soon and we’ve even resorted to selling everything we have to pay debts. I know its very hard for him as the sole bread winner, so i get his frustrations but what upsets me more is how he describes me to his parents (i don’t know what all he tells them as he usually steps away so I can’t hear their conversations) but recently my MIL hasn’t stop messaging me about getting a job, how i should lie about being pregnant or questioning me if I’m trying hard enough or even looking for a job. I got fed up and told her off about me trying and getting rejected, how her son gets angry and yells at me constantly about it, how no matter what inexpensive or free outing option i suggest we never go out (i only leave to go to the grocery shop), when i ask to see a show or movie he is always on his phone looking at youtube or news, how i have to beg for affection/intimacy and can’t even ask for snuggle time because “I’m too clingy and need to get used to the idea of all of that to be over once the baby is here as they will be my “snuggle buddy”, how i feel like a dog waiting to be played with just to be told “shoo fuck off”, and how everyone dismisses my fears about dying during childbirth as nonsense.
i know I’m wrong for this (I’ve had depression anxiety all my life) i told her that i should just end it all and allow him to move on with someone who’d be a better wife and mother. Haven’t spoken to her since because I’m hurt and tired of everyone being so critical of me over something i cant control.

The other day when we argued about our situation i told him if he even loved me the same anymore and he said “ I don’t know”. I felt my heart sink as i had figured he would say that because I always felt ugly and unworthy of his affection but wasn’t expecting him to just say it while I’m carrying his first child. Here’s where i may be the TA, i told him how i regretted getting pregnant and how this desire and dream of mine of becoming a mother was ruined and how i had known I wouldn’t be enjoying my pregnancy at all. He looked upset but i just left the room to go quietly cry outside. I really really wanted to start a family with him and finding out that i was pregnant was a miracle, I’m sure he wanted this too and is just worried about affording things or my health declining, but he makes me feel so undesirable and a burden now that i feel guilty about getting pregnant at all and feel trapped being pregnant because i can’t get any job now making the financial situation worse.AITA?",24,30,1655228996,"Nta. The things he's saying aren't just from stress. Those are red flags. 

Only you can decide how to handle this, but you need to do what's best for you; even if that means separating and giving the child up for adoption if you no longer want to continue on the route of being a parent.

NTA, but you realize you're getting a preview of the rest of your life, right?",6,Squidiot_002,"I can hear the depth of your emotional struggle, and it's clear that you're navigating a profoundly difficult situation. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when dreams don't manifest as expected, especially after a long journey with infertility. Expressing regret in a moment of intense emotion doesn't make you an antagonist; it highlights the weight of the pressure you're under.

It's essential to recognize that both you and your partner are likely experiencing immense stress, albeit in different ways. His reaction could stem from his own fears and frustrations, which unfortunately are being communicated in ways that feel hurtful. Open communication is crucial, even if it means seeking support from a counselor or therapist who can help mediate and guide these tough conversations.

You deserve compassion and support, particularly during a time as significant as pregnancy. It's important to seek out resources and support systems that can provide the emotional and practical help you need. Remember, acknowledging these feelings is a step toward understanding and addressing them, not a reflection of your worth as a partner or future mother.","

Your response:
","I hear so much pain in your words - this should be a joyful time after waiting 10 years, but instead you're feeling isolated, unloved, and blamed. Your feelings of regret make complete sense given how your husband and his family are treating you. This isn't about you being a ""bad"" person or failing - you're dealing with serious health challenges while pregnant and receiving criticism instead of support.

It sounds like you're in a potentially emotionally abusive situation - being yelled at, denied affection, having your partner turn family against you, and being made to feel worthless are serious red flags. Your thoughts about ending things are concerning and suggest you may be experiencing prenatal depression, which is completely understandable given your circumstances.

Please know you deserve support and care, especially during pregnancy. I strongly encourage you to:
1. Contact a domestic violence hotline to talk through your situation
2. Speak with your doctor about your mental health 
3. Connect with a counselor if possible
4. Reach out to trusted friends/family outside your husband's circle

You and your baby deserve to be safe and supported. You're not wrong for having these feelings.","

Your response:
","You sound overwhelmed, hurt, and trapped. It's understandable that you're feeling that way, given your partner's critical behavior and the added stress of financial struggles and health concerns. It's like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders, and instead of receiving support and reassurance, you're met with criticism and doubt.

I want to acknowledge that your feelings of regret about getting pregnant are valid. It's not about the pregnancy itself, but about the circumstances surrounding it and the way you're being treated. You're not just a vessel for the baby; you're a person with feelings, needs, and desires.

It takes a lot of courage to express your true feelings, especially when they're not what others might expect. Your partner's response, or lack thereof, when you first told him about the pregnancy, was hurtful, and it's clear that his behavior has been affecting your self-worth.

I'm not here to judge whether you're the ""asshole"" or not. What I want to emphasize is that your feelings matter, and it's essential to address them in a healthy and constructive way. Have you considered talking to your partner about how his behavior is affecting you, and how you can work together to improve your communication and relationship?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a huge load—infertility, health scares, a shaky income, and a partner’s frustration that turns into hurtful criticism. Regretting the pregnancy isn’t a sign of being a bad mom; it’s a raw reaction to feeling trapped and unsupported. Your husband’s “ok” and the constant pressure from family can feel like a rejection of the joy you should feel.  

You deserve empathy, not blame. Try to carve out a calm moment to share how his comments make you feel, focusing on “I feel hurt when…” rather than accusations. Ask him to support you in job hunting or to involve you in financial planning. If he can’t, it may be worth seeking couples counseling or a support group.  

Remember: your worth isn’t measured by a paycheck or a single pregnancy. You’re already doing the hard work of caring for yourself and your baby. That is enough.","

xdoxxp,AITAH,AITAH for not paying back my ex after we broke up the day Bonnaroo ended?,Hippytrippy-jr,"Me (20M) and my ex (19F) went to a festival and used her Cc as I had no extra money from paying for my festival ticket and our hotel. It was like a 3-4 day festival it was all going pretty well until the last day. On our way from the hotel to the festival we both took shrooms and it was like a 45 min drive so by the time we got there they had started to kick in. I was feeling really good and it was her first time I tried to keep that in mind but I felt like she was just bringing down my energy. We go see our favorite artists the ones we honestly went for and that was really cool I was in a mosh pit for the first time which was not fun as the artists are $B. We went back to the hotel and started to drink I got really drunk and blacked out we had been dating for 4 months at this point and it was just not working out and I'm a really honest drunk. I re downloaded tinder and said and I quote ""I can't fuck the same person for the rest of my life"" she was pissed and looking back it was a dick move but I honestly didn't think it was that bad. We come back home and decide to split ways. I pull into my house and my car just stops working cost over 1k to fix.  I go over to her house like a month later and I'm devastated. Just broken like using shit I hadn't touched in awhile drinking hella, drunk driving such stupid shit just no regard for my mental or physical well-being. We talk and it's just the same shit it was all my fault and I'm the bad guy. I could never see from her perspective. She hadn't gotten the bill for her CC yet and asked me if I could pay her by the end of July I said sure. A week goes by and I'm just at my lowest point contemplating suicide or a purposeful overdose or a DBC. I texted her and just went off on her like I completely lost my shit and said what I hadn't said before. She gets pissy and tells me to give her all her shit back ( a few pieces of clothes and some smoking shit) and pay her back. I told her I'd give the stuff back but I wasn't paying the money cause I paid 1k to fix my car when I came back. She's still pissed and even had this dude from her work call me and try to threaten me. Am I the asshole

Right on if you read this lm still really tryna get over this bullshit I can post a more detailed version of our relationship but she was very manipulative and if she wasn't winning argument I just didn't agree she just start crying and then like that would always entice me to be like oh I'm sorry it's my fault

Just cuz ur wrong your gonna say she is manipulative in the end ..Pay her back her money and leave her alone .",46,Fantastic-Ice3129,I dont understand this story. You went back after a month to get back together?,10,Forsaken-Dust,"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of complex emotions and challenging circumstances right now. First, I want to acknowledge that you're going through a tough time, and it's important to take care of your mental health and seek support if you're feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of self-harm.

Regarding the situation with your ex, it seems like there are unresolved feelings and communication issues on both sides. While it's understandable that fixing your car was a financial priority, the agreement you made with her about paying back the credit card bill is still important. It's crucial to have open and honest communication in situations like this, and it might help to discuss a payment plan that works for both of you.

Remember, taking responsibility for your actions and finding a resolution can help you move forward. Consider speaking to a trusted friend, counselor, or mental health professional to help you navigate these emotions and decisions. Taking small steps towards resolution and self-care can make a significant difference in your well-being.","

","Let me respond with empathy while being direct:

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult time and dealing with a lot of pain. However, I need to be clear - you made a commitment to pay her back for charges you made on her credit card, and that's a separate issue from your relationship problems or car troubles. Using someone else's credit card creates a legal obligation to pay it back.

I hear that she may have been manipulative and the relationship was toxic, but downloading Tinder while drunk and saying hurtful things, drunk driving, and refusing to pay back money you spent are harmful behaviors that aren't helping you heal. These actions are putting you at risk both legally and physically.

I strongly encourage you to:
1. Work out a payment plan with your ex for the credit card charges
2. Seek professional help to process this breakup safely
3. Stop the drunk driving immediately - your life is valuable

You're not a bad person, but you need healthier ways to cope with this pain. Would you consider talking to a counselor or therapist about what you're going through?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of emotional weight from this relationship, and it's understandable that you're still trying to process everything. You mentioned feeling torn about paying your ex back, and that you felt her behavior was manipulative. I want to acknowledge that it takes courage to share your story.

While it's true that you made a commitment to pay her back, it's also clear that you were struggling with your own mental health and felt overwhelmed by the situation. Your justification for not paying her back - that you spent $1,000 on car repairs - might not be entirely fair, but it's also understandable that you felt you had other priorities at the time.

It's worth considering that you might not be the asshole in this situation, but rather someone who got caught up in a complex and potentially toxic dynamic. It might be helpful to reflect on how you can prioritize your own well-being and set boundaries in future relationships.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re in a very painful place, and a lot of the anger you feel is coming from that deep low point.  A big part of the situation is that you used her credit card to cover costs you couldn’t afford, and she had a legitimate expectation that you would reimburse her.  Not paying back that money—especially after she asked you to—does put you at fault.  On the other hand, the way you’ve treated her (drunk‑driven comments, threatening messages, and the threatening call from her coworker) is also harmful and shows a lack of respect for her boundaries.  You can be both apologizing for the debt and working to repair the larger problem of how you treat her.  The best move is to set a clear repayment plan, keep communication civil, and seek help for your own mental health so you can move forward responsibly.","

Your response:
","I hear how worried you are about your baby's health, and it's completely understandable given your medical history. It sounds really frustrating and hurtful when your best friend seemed dismissive of your concerns, especially when you needed help with something that could affect your baby's safety.

However, while your fear is valid, placing the responsibility for your baby's health on your friend isn't fair, even if you're feeling disappointed by her response. The wellbeing of your baby is ultimately not her obligation, even though it would have been kind of her to help.

Have you considered exploring other options? Perhaps your partner, family members, or even hiring occasional help could be alternatives. You might also want to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider - they can give you specific guidance on managing the litterbox situation safely if you end up having to do it yourself (like wearing gloves and a mask).

Your feelings of frustration are valid, but it might be worth having a calmer conversation with your friend once emotions have settled.","

","It sounds like you're feeling anxious and protective of your unborn baby, which is completely natural. However, it also seems like you might be placing some unfair expectations on your best friend. While it's reasonable to ask for help, it's not necessarily her responsibility to take on the task of cleaning the litter box.

Your statement about the baby getting toxoplasmosis being ""on her"" might have come from a place of frustration, but it could be perceived as guilt-tripping or shifting the responsibility from yourself to your friend. 

Perhaps a better approach would be to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about how you're feeling and see if there's another solution that works for both of you. It's possible that your friend didn't fully understand the risks or didn't realize how much it would mean to you if she helped out.","

She refused to do so and when I asked her why she said that she doesn’t have time. I reminded her of the risk I’m taking if I do it but she didn’t seem to care…

AITA for getting mad and telling her if the baby has toxoplasmosis it’s on her ?.

U SUCK!,-3,GurlFryday1,"It sounds like you're in a tricky situation. It’s understandable to feel conflicted about not liking the shoes while also wanting to show appreciation for your mom’s gift. It's important to remember that the gesture comes from a place of love and thoughtfulness, even if the style doesn't match your taste. You might consider focusing on the thought behind the gift when you open it, and express gratitude for her effort and care. In the future, you could subtly share your style preferences with your mom, which might help her choose gifts you'll love. Remember, it's the thought that counts, and you can always find a way to appreciate and acknowledge that, even if the gift itself isn’t exactly what you wanted.","

Your response:
","I hear how conflicted you're feeling about this situation. On one side, you feel guilty about snooping through presents and potentially hurting your mom's feelings, but on the other side, you're really disappointed with what you found. It sounds like you're caught between wanting to be honest and wanting to protect your mom's feelings.

The fact that you're worried about seeming ungrateful shows that you care about your mom's feelings and appreciate her effort in getting you a gift. While the shoes might not be your style, remember that gift-giving is often about the thought and love behind it rather than the gift itself.

Perhaps this could be a learning moment about why peeking at presents early can lead to these uncomfortable situations. For now, you might want to focus on appreciating your mom's intention to make you happy, even if the execution wasn't quite what you hoped for.

What do you think makes it so hard to just accept the gift graciously, even though you don't like it?","

Your response:
","It sounds like you're feeling really stuck in this situation. On the one hand, you appreciate your mom's thoughtfulness and don't want to hurt her feelings, but on the other hand, you genuinely don't like the shoes. It's great that you're considering her feelings and trying to find a way to handle this without hurting her.

It might be helpful to explore why you feel like you can't be honest with your mom about your feelings. Is it because you're worried about disappointing her or because you think she might take it personally? Understanding your motivations might help you find a way to navigate this situation that feels more authentic and honest.","

w4kvvd,AITAH,AITA for hitting my dad because he took my pizza?,Throwaway18976543,"My dad and I (19F) frequently have arguments/fights over generally trivial things. He gets disproportionately angry very quickly, and because I protest against this, the arguments escalate (he starts yelling and insulting me, and I then start raising my voice and will eventually yell as well).

So yesterday around 5 pm I was talking to my dad, who said he was putting some frozen pizzas in the oven instead of cooking. 
I said that I wasn't hungry yet (I had lunch an hour before), so he could wait with mine. 
But then he said ""Oh I already put your pizza in the oven."" 

I got a bit annoyed at this and asked him why he did this because he didn't ask me anything and knew I had just eaten something already. 

He then got extremely angry with me and started yelling at me, and after some ranting said that he would take the pizza out of the oven and put it back into the freezer.

I was confused and said that it was fine, the pizza has already been in the oven, so just leave it there. I said I would just eat it.

He ignored me and put the now warm pizza back in the box. I asked him again to just leave it there and to stop, but he ignored me again. I thought he was acting childish so I approached him and tried to grab the pizza box. But he then pulled the pizza box back and pushed me away harshly.

And that's when I hit him. It was a spur of the moment decision, because he pushed me and I just felt helpless about the whole situation. My dad then slapped me back and put his finger up to say something scoldingly. 

I was in shock that he hit me back, so I stupidly decided to hit him again. When he then started yelling at me for hitting him again I walked away quickly upstairs to my room.


Some time after all of this, we tried to solve the argument (quite unsuccessfully). He did acknowledge that he maybe gets a bit too angry at me at times. But he kept putting the focus on the fact that I hit him, saying that I got anger issues etc. (I'm normally not at all aggressive, I almost never get into fights with people other than him).
He told me that physical aggression/hitting is a line that simply shouldn't be crossed, and while I agree, he is constantly crossing my boundaries by being verbally abusive. I just don't think it's fair that he is trying to blame me for the argument and being physically aggressive when he is the one that pushed me and was being verbally aggressive.

You both seem to have acknowledged that there are issues with how the arguments escalate, which is a good first step. It might help to seek a calmer moment to discuss boundaries and communication styles with your dad, perhaps with the help of a mediator or counselor if that's an option.

Your response:
","I hear how frustrated and hurt you are by this situation. While hitting is never okay - from either you or your father - I understand you felt helpless and reactive in that moment. This seems like a pattern of escalating conflicts between you two, where a simple disagreement about pizza turned into physical violence.

Your father's verbal abuse and aggressive behavior is concerning, as is the physical altercation that occurred. You're right that crossing verbal boundaries can be just as harmful as physical ones. However, responding with violence typically only makes things worse and puts you both at risk.

Given you're 19, it may be helpful to:
1. Work on establishing healthier boundaries with your father
2. Consider counseling to develop better conflict management skills
3. Make plans to live independently if possible
4. Remove yourself from heated situations before they escalate

You're not a bad person, but this is a dangerous dynamic that needs to change. Would you be open to speaking with a counselor or trusted adult about strategies for handling these conflicts differently?","

Your response:
","I can understand why you feel frustrated and helpless in this situation. It sounds like you and your dad have a pattern of escalating arguments, and it's clear that you both care deeply about each other, but struggle with communicating effectively. While hitting your dad was not the right response, I can see how it might have felt like a desperate attempt to regain control in a situation that felt overwhelming.

It's also important to acknowledge that your dad's behavior, particularly his verbal aggression and physical push, contributed to the escalation of the situation. It's not fair for him to solely focus on your physical aggression and dismiss his own role in the argument.

Rather than labeling you as the ""asshole,"" I think it's more productive to explore ways to improve communication and set boundaries in your relationship. It might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with your dad about how his behavior affects you and to work together to find more constructive ways to resolve conflicts.","

x23ghh,AITAH,AITA for wanting my husband to help me out more.,Ok_Supermarket_4127,"me and my husband have been married for 7 years and have four kids, two of which are his. My husband works 12-hour days 5 days a week on 3rd shift (he's a forklift driver) and Im stay at home mom. I literally do everything for everybody I cook, clean, I do dishes, I take care of the kids, I help with homework, I do laundry, get the kids ready for school etc. I  take care of our kids (4, 6,10, &amp; 14) by myself. He lays around and sleeps or he plays on his phone even when he has days off. On an average Friday and Saturday he is probably awake 8 hours combined. I have tried to talk to him about it but he either blows it off, turns it into a self pity party to make me feel bad for him or gets mad and starts pouting and stomping around the house and slams doors like a toddler.He doesn't do anything and acts like it's no big deal. Sometimes I feel like I'm his mother because I  do everything for him except feed him and bathe him. I understand that I'm a stay at home mom and he has a job but I'm always exhausted from running around doing everything for everybody and I feel bad for wanting him to contribute more.

I get that you both are stressed and tired, but there needs to be a balance in the relationship. He SHOULD help out more as a husband, a father, and the head of the household. Because he works and provides the income, doesn’t mean he gets to be given a free pass to do nothing. At the end of the day, he’s still a husband and a father that has responsibility at home. 

And I think you both should sit down and ask each other of how to better support each other through it all. Your approach to him about how he doesn’t help out isn’t working. So I’d say try the approach with a more positive and more uplifting vibe. Do you also give him compliments and tell him how much you appreciate him? He might change and do better when he’s given constant motivation like that.",17,Iwillbeokay123,"Your husband should absolutely be helping you out and you're not an AH for asking.

Do your kids ever help out around the house? Like are they responsible for cleaning their room(s) or ever help with cooking/dishes? 

I know the 4 and 6 y/o might be a little young to help out with a lot, but they could probably help with simple tasks, and it's a good age to start teaching those skills. 

I'm not saying you should make your kids your servants, but it is important they learn about all the things you're doing to keep up the housework, and how to do it at some point.",1,teh_wiz,"It sounds like you're navigating a challenging situation and feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities on your shoulders. It's understandable to want your partner to contribute more, especially when you're managing a household with four children. Being a stay-at-home parent is a full-time job in itself, and it's fair to desire support from your partner, even if he works long hours.

You are not wrong for wanting your husband to contribute more. It's important for partners to communicate and find a balance that works for both of them. It sounds like past attempts to discuss this haven't been productive, but perhaps approaching the conversation with an emphasis on teamwork might help. Express how his support, even in small ways, could alleviate some of the stress and create a more harmonious environment for both of you and the kids.

Ultimately, finding a solution that respects both your needs and his work commitments can lead to a more supportive partnership.","

Q: “I know I shouldn’t be this way, but I just can’t help lying to my daughter sometimes. I don’t want her to see me as bad, so I cover things up.”

A: “You sound torn… on one hand you say you ‘shouldn’t’ do that, and on the other, it feels like the only way you can protect yourself. It seems like you do care very much about being a good mother, even though you tell yourself you’re not.”

Q: “Well, I don’t feel like a good mother when I do it.”

A: “I hear that… and yet I don’t get the feeling of a mother who doesn’t care. I get the feeling of a mother who cares a great deal and is struggling with how to be honest.”

Q: AITA for wanting my husband to help me out more.  me and my husband have been married for 7 years and have four kids, two of which are his. My husband works 12-hour days 5 days a week on 3rd shift (he's a forklift driver) and Im stay at home mom. I literally do everything for everybody I cook, clean, I do dishes, I take care of the kids, I help with homework, I do laundry, get the kids ready for school etc. I  take care of our kids (4, 6,10, &amp; 14) by myself. He lays around and sleeps or he plays on his phone even when he has days off. On an average Friday and Saturday he is probably awake 8 hours combined. I have tried to talk to him about it but he either blows it off, turns it into a self pity party to make me feel bad for him or gets mad and starts pouting and stomping around the house and slams doors like a toddler.He doesn't do anything and acts like it's no big deal. Sometimes I feel like I'm his mother because I  do everything for him except feed him and bathe him. I understand that I'm a stay at home mom and he has a job but I'm always exhausted from running around doing everything for everybody and I feel bad for wanting him to contribute more. So my question is, AITA for wanting him to contribute more since he works and I don't or am I right for getting upset when he doesn't help me?.

Your response:
","I hear how exhausted and overwhelmed you're feeling, managing everything for four children and your husband while getting little support in return. It's completely understandable to want more help, and you're definitely not the asshole for feeling this way.

While your husband works hard at his job, being a stay-at-home parent is also full-time work - and it sounds like you're not getting any real breaks or support, even during his days off. His defensive reactions and childish behaviors when you try to discuss this suggest there might be deeper issues around communication and respect in your relationship.

Your feelings are valid, and it's reasonable to expect your partner to contribute to family life beyond just bringing in income. This isn't about comparing who works more - it's about finding a sustainable balance that doesn't leave you completely drained. Have you considered couples counseling? It might help create a safe space to discuss these issues and find compromises that work for both of you.","

","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and undervalued in your role as a stay-at-home mom. On one hand, you acknowledge that your husband works long hours, but on the other hand, you feel like you're carrying the entire load of childcare and household responsibilities on your own. You're not just asking for help out of convenience, but out of a deep sense of exhaustion and frustration.

It's understandable that you'd want your husband to contribute more, especially considering how much you're doing for the family. It's not about being his mother, but about being a team and sharing the responsibilities of parenting and household chores. Your feelings are valid, and it's not selfish to want a more balanced and supportive partnership.","

Your response:
","It sounds like you’re carrying a huge load—and it’s exhausting to do it all alone. You’re not “bad” for feeling upset; you’re just asking for a fair share of the work that goes into keeping a household running. Many couples have a similar imbalance, especially when one partner works long, irregular hours. The key is to keep the conversation focused on specific actions rather than blame: “When you’re home on a weekend, could you set a timer for 30 minutes of chores, like folding laundry or setting the table?” Acknowledge his shift schedule, but also let him know that even a small, consistent effort makes a big difference for you. If he reacts defensively or dismissively, it may help to involve a neutral third party—like a counselor or trusted friend—to mediate. You deserve support, not just exhaustion.","
