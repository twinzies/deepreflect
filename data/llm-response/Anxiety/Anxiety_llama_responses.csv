Coffee is the best! Try it again with the same consequences.",1,r3dl3opard,"""Hey OP, I totally get it. It's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle and can't escape. I've been there too, and it's exhausting. First off, just want to acknowledge that it's not your fault - anxiety and depression can be super sneaky and make everyday tasks feel like monumental challenges.

One thing that might help is finding alternative energy boosters that don't involve caffeine. For me, a quick 10-minute walk outside or some light stretching can do wonders for my mood and energy levels. Also, have you tried establishing a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down? Maybe something like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches?

Remember, it's okay to take things one small step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you can't break the cycle right away. Just focus on making tiny progress each day, and know that you're not alone in this struggle.""","

r5dver,Anxiety,Do you ever stay up late cause it‚Äôs your time to just exist?,[deleted],"If I go to sleep then the next day is gonna come so much faster, but if I stay up late I can just exist and not have to deal with the world and I can just be in my little bubble.

There's something so appealing about those late-night hours when the world outside feels like it's just paused, and you're free to just be. No expectations, no responsibilities, just the quiet and calm.

I think it's amazing that you've found a way to carve out this time for yourself, even if it means sacrificing some sleep. It's almost like you're giving yourself permission to just exist, to breathe, and to be present in the moment.

Here's the thing, though - while it's great that you've found this little bubble, don't forget that the world outside isn't always as overwhelming as it feels. Sometimes, taking a step back and acknowledging your feelings can actually make it easier to face the next day. Maybe try journaling or taking a few deep breaths before bed to help you process your emotions. You might find that it makes it easier to sleep, and you can still wake up feeling refreshed and ready to face whatever comes next.

You're not alone in this, by the way. I think a lot of us can relate to feeling like we just need a little more time to ourselves.","

As someone who's struggled with anxiety and missing classes in the past, it's incredibly reassuring to hear that professors actually care about their students' well-being. I think a lot of us get caught up in the idea that we're disappointing you or falling behind, and it's hard to shake off that feeling.

Your advice to just shoot an email and be open about what's going on is really helpful. It's also a great reminder that professors are people too, and they've likely been in similar situations. I'll definitely take your words to heart and encourage others to do the same.

To anyone who's struggling with missing classes, I want to add that it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your mental health. Don't let guilt or anxiety hold you back from reaching out for help. And to professors like OP, thank you for being understanding and supportive. It makes all the difference.","

First of all, just want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean that you're failing or that there's anything wrong with you. Anxiety can be a really powerful force, but it doesn't define your worth as a person.

If you're feeling comfortable, can you try taking a few deep breaths with me? Inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of seven, and exhale for a count of eight. Sometimes, this can help calm your body and mind down a bit.

Remember that you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to help. If you feel safe doing so, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. You got this, and you can get through this.","

n0y195,Anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,SendBoobPics4ADollar,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&amp;#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",3269,147,1619676000,The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,1235,bruhmomentnumber46,The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,1235,bruhmomentnumber46,"""Dude, that's incredible empathy and kindness you showed your Uber driver. I can only imagine how scary it must be to have a panic attack while driving someone around. Your response was perfect - acknowledging his struggle, offering space, and not making him feel like he's inconveniencing you. It's amazing that you were able to share your own experience with panic attacks and offer support.

One thing that stood out to me was your suggestion to let him finish the trip. That takes a lot of understanding and compassion. It's clear that you prioritized his well-being and financial needs over your own convenience.

Your story is a great reminder that we never know what someone might be going through, and a little kindness can go a long way. I'm sure your driver appreciated your support and understanding, and who knows, maybe your conversation will help him feel more comfortable opening up about his anxiety in the future.""","

I used to think I was just being 'responsible' or 'cautious', but in reality, I was just letting my high functioning anxiety control my thoughts and actions.

One thing that's helped me is recognizing when my brain is slipping into worst-case scenario mode. When that happens, I try to challenge those thoughts by asking myself if they're based in reality. I also remind myself that I've survived every difficult situation I've ever faced, and I can do it again.

Another thing that's helped is practicing self-compassion. Instead of beating myself up over mistakes, I try to treat myself with kindness and understanding. I remind myself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay not to be perfect.

It's great that you're acknowledging these patterns in yourself. Recognizing them is the first step to making a change. Keep working on it, and remember that you're not alone in this. We're all in this together.","

And it's not just about the anxiety - it's also super helpful for people with dietary restrictions or preferences. Knowing what options are available beforehand can make all the difference.

I totally second your plea to restaurants to post their menus online. It's literally the simplest thing they can do to make their customers' lives easier. And it's not like it's a huge ask - just throw the menu up on the website or social media, and you're good to go.

To all my fellow anxious eaters out there, don't be afraid to reach out to restaurants if you can't find their menu online. A quick phone call or DM can go a long way in helping you feel more prepared and confident. And to the restaurants, let's make this a standard practice already!","

I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy.

She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you.

It's amazing how one simple phrase can shift our perspective like that. I can totally relate to the feeling of worrying what others will think - it's like we're constantly seeking validation for our emotions. But your therapist nailed it - it's about how it affects YOU, not anyone else.

What I love about this is that it's a reminder that our experiences and feelings are unique to us, and that's what makes them valid. It's not about comparing our problems to others or seeking external validation; it's about acknowledging that what we're going through is real and worthy of attention.

Your therapist sounds amazing, and I'm so happy you found someone who gets it. Remember to be kind to yourself and keep that phrase in mind whenever you're feeling anxious or uncertain - 'it's a big deal because it's a big deal to you.' You got this, and you deserve to heal and thrive!","

If I could offer some advice, it would be to communicate your boundaries with the people in your life. Let them know how they can best support you when they need to have a serious conversation. For me, it's been helpful to say, ""Hey, if you need to talk about something, can you please give me a heads up on what it's about? Or can we schedule a specific time to talk?""

It's not about avoiding conversations, but about being able to mentally prepare myself. I hope this helps, and I'm sending you all the calm vibes.","

At any given moment, the physical mechanisms of your brain are using about a quarter of the resources carried to it by blood (air, water, nutrients). When thinking hard, you can use up to 50%. That's half of all your blood and resources just for the brain, and half for the rest of the whole body. If overthinking is exhausting you, it's literally because you are exhausting your resources with your brain. There's nothing imaginary about it.",421,Kwakigra,"I like that, really interesting way to look at it.  Thanks for sharing!",11,pickindim_kmet,"""I love this analogy, and I'm glad your psychiatrist found a way to help you understand the impact of anxiety on your energy levels. It's so relatable to think of our mental resources as a finite battery that can get drained when we're constantly 'on edge'.

I've found that recognizing the toll anxiety takes on our energy is the first step to making positive changes. From there, it's about learning to manage those feelings and prioritize self-care. For me, that means setting realistic goals, taking breaks when I need them, and practicing mindfulness techniques to calm my mind.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's amazing that you're taking steps to understand and address your anxiety. Keep exploring what works for you, and don't be too hard on yourself when you need to take a step back. You're not alone in this, and there are people here who care about your well-being.""","

Mondays can be tough, and it's easy to get caught up in the stress of the day. I've been finding myself tensing up lately, and it's amazing how a simple deep breath can calm everything down.

I also want to add that it's great you're spreading kindness like this. We often forget to take care of ourselves, and a gentle reminder like yours can make a big difference. If anyone's feeling overwhelmed, I recommend taking a short walk outside or doing some quick stretching exercises. It can really help shift your focus and clear your mind.

Thanks again for the reminder, and I hope you have a wonderful Monday too!""","

One thing that's helped me is to set a consistent bedtime routine, even on nights when I'm feeling anxious about the next day. It's not about having more time, but about using the time I have more intentionally. Try setting a specific bedtime, and then use the hour or so leading up to it to do something that actually helps you relax, like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches. It might not feel like it's giving you more time, but it can help you feel more grounded and prepared for the next day.""","

It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of survival mode, where just making it through the day feels like the only goal. I've been there too, and it's exhausting.

Firstly, please know that you're not wasting your life - you're just taking care of yourself in the best way you know how right now. However, I understand your desire to do more and live more intentionally. 

One thing that might help is to start small. Instead of trying to overhaul your entire life, try to find one thing each day that brings you joy or fulfillment. It could be as simple as taking a short walk during lunch, reading a chapter in a book, or cooking a new recipe. Having something to look forward to can make the day feel less monotonous.

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and it's okay to not have it all figured out. You're taking the first step by recognizing your pattern and wanting to change. Keep taking tiny steps towards a more fulfilling life, and be kind to yourself in the process.","

ghiqy2,Anxiety,Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?,shoretee,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don‚Äôt have a bad relationship with any of them. I don‚Äôt consider myself anti social. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day.

It‚Äôs hard but sometimes doing a reality check that my thought is actually a worse case scenario or unrealistic black and white thinking, for example, and not necessarily true just because it popped into my head can be really helpful.",284,jessicamay14,"I completely understand what you're going through - it's like having a constant 'what if' loop playing in the back of your mind. I've experienced similar feelings, especially in social situations where I feel like I might have inadvertently offended someone. 

One thing that helped me was to acknowledge that these feelings are usually rooted in my own anxiety and self-doubt, rather than any actual wrongdoing. When I catch myself spiraling into 'what if' mode, I try to reframe the situation in a more realistic light. I remind myself that I'm not a mind-reader, and that people's reactions are often more about themselves than me.

It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings. They can offer you personalized strategies to manage your anxiety and build confidence in your social interactions.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's amazing that you're willing to open up and share your experiences with others. Your vulnerability is genuinely helping others feel less isolated, so thank you for that.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?

POST BODY: Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don‚Äôt have a bad relationship with any of them. I don‚Äôt consider myself anti social. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they‚Äôll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don‚Äôt want to be a broken record either. I‚Äôm sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I‚Äôm not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you‚Äôre not alone brings you some relief as well. And I‚Äôm nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I‚Äôm here.

I feel less alone when it comes to this subject but at the same time it's sad and upsetting to know that this problem is everywhere and the mental health when it comes to society has a loooooooong way till it's normalised like a physical illness. Sending my support to you guys and I hope the world can eventually treat you better without being gaslit &lt;3",2377,123,1620396626,"I think a lot of people just don't understand what anxiety/depression actually looks like and get overwhelmed when faced with it. I try not to blame them because it's something society doesn't talk about much and can be a lot. 

When someone exhibits ""normal"" levels of stress/worry/sadness it's easy to alleviate that person's pain with support and kind words and encouragement. Plus, there's usually a light at the end of the tunnel, an end point. Someone saying they are having anxiety over a presentation at work presents it and then the stress is done. That's what a lot of people think anxiety means both because we use that word flippantly and because its what people talk about when referring to ""anxiety"". (Please know I'm not saying these people don't have anxiety or can't feel overwhelmed, I am not gatekeeping the term, just that it's harmful when we use that term in only one way). 

Then here comes someone who says they are having anxiety and are in the bathroom for an hour, having trouble breathing, can't eat, can't get out of bed. And people are like whoa whoa whoa, this isn't anxiety, this has got to be some way worse mental health issue! Especially if it keeps happening!

I guess what I'm trying to say in a very long winded way is that we have turned the words 'anxiety' and 'depression' into meaning 'stressed' and 'sad'. People can deal with those emotions, there's a definitive end to those feelings. Most don't know what to do with someone having prolonged anxiety attacks. Which is why we need to more openly discuss mental health so more of us can be informed.",234,Kiwikow,"Literally at my workplace, this happened:

All-staff meeting: HR gives presentation on wellness and taking care of your health.

Later that same day: HR messages me to scold me about a few hours of sick leave.",10,stayonthecloud,"I completely get where you're coming from. It's infuriating when companies and society in general preach mental health awareness, but the moment you actually show signs of struggling, you're judged and stigmatized. It's like, they want to look good on paper, but when it comes to actual action and accommodation, it's a different story.

I think it's essential to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. There are people who genuinely care and want to help. It might be worth having an open conversation with your HR department or a trusted supervisor about your needs and boundaries. It's also crucial to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself, even if that means setting boundaries or seeking support outside of work.

Remember, your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek help when you need it. You deserve to be supported and understood, not judged or condemned. Sending you lots of love and solidarity, and I'm glad to see that you're feeling less alone after sharing your story.","

One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around 'wasted' years. Instead of viewing those years as lost, try to see them as a catalyst for growth. Every experience, even the tough ones, has the potential to teach you something valuable. You're already doing that by recognizing your anxiety and seeking support, so that's a huge step forward.

Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.",rubertidom,"Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat.

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

Mopping the floor can take me a month because I‚Äôll put it off til the next morning. Then the evening. Rinse repeat.

I can put off shopping until my cupboards are bare and sometimes go through withdrawal because I can‚Äôt do something as simple as refill a repeat prescription.

An interaction on one of my posts today had me realise that the more I ruminate over tasks, the more daunting they become. 

One of the household chores I never seem to struggle with for example, has always been the dishes. Because it‚Äôs never been something I‚Äôve put on my mental to do list. I tend to wash a couple of dishes while I‚Äôm waiting for the kettle to boil or waiting for the microwave to ping etc etc and they just get done. 

But mopping the floor becomes an impossible task because I overthink it. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just mop the floor. I‚Äôve gotta sweep first. Then I have to pick up all the stuff on the floor. Then I‚Äôve gotta make up the bucket etc etc etc. Oh and there‚Äôs no point having a clean floor if the stove is dirty. So I have to clean that first and then the wall tiles are gonna look weird if the floor is all shiny. So I‚Äôll have to clean those too... then the windows will need doing. Eh. There‚Äôs no time for all that now‚Äù then I‚Äôve made it into a whole thing. 

Stupid example, but that‚Äôs pretty much how I approach everything in life and I‚Äôm just sat here on my arse doing nothing with my life at 32 because making a phone call is too hard",134,s4few0rd,Goodness. I wish it was that easy,4,Fosad,"I can totally relate to this struggle. It's like our brains are wired to put off the thing that's causing us the most anxiety, but in reality, that just makes it worse. I've been there too, where a task seems manageable in the morning but becomes an insurmountable mountain by the end of the day.

I love this tip, and I'm so glad you shared it. Making the anxiety-provoking task your first task of the day can be a total game-changer. Not only do you get it out of the way, but you also build confidence and momentum for the rest of the day.

One thing that might help is breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, be kind to yourself as you work through it ‚Äì remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious, and that you're taking steps to overcome it.

Thanks for sharing this tip, and I hope it helps others as much as it's helped you!","

okttam,Anxiety,I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it.,Marthmellow44,"It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out.

It's completely understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed and shaken - it's not every day we put ourselves out of our comfort zones like that. But the fact that you did it despite your fears is truly admirable.

You're not making a big deal out of being a decent human, by the way - it's the small acts of kindness like these that can make a huge difference in someone's life. And it's not just about the physical warmth the blanket and hot water bottle will bring, but the emotional comfort of knowing someone cares.

Remember that your anxiety is valid, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. But it's also important to acknowledge and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. You've shown yourself that you're capable of overcoming your fears and doing something amazing, and that's something to be proud of. Keep being kind, and don't be too hard on yourself.","

jubv7z,Anxiety,There are people out there who don't have anxiety,AKLJW1122,"Isn't it just such a wild thought that there are people out there who just live their lives? They're not constantly worrying or feeling overwhelmed. They don't have panic attacks. They're able to do whatever they feel like doing! Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.

I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a ""normal"" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.

EDIT: I was not expecting this much of a response from everyone, I am very surprised! I am a little overwhelmed by all the comments, so I'm sorry if I don't respond to you but I am reading them! Thank you so much everyone. You are all lovely people, wishing you all the best!",2104,248,1605397453,"Yeah, this is my boyfriend essentially. It‚Äôs fascinating to witness and I envy his carefree attitude to life.",443,Roxy_Tanya,I definitely understand this.  I'm convinced I could have been anything if I didn't have this anxiety holding me back and this crippling fear that I'm just not good enough,170,Niki-Nicole,"I can totally understand why you'd feel that way. It's mind-boggling to think about how some people can just breeze through life without the weight of anxiety holding them back. I've struggled with anxiety myself, and it's like living in a constant state of 'what if' - always on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time. It's easy to get caught up in the idea of 'fearless' people, but the truth is, everyone has their own struggles - anxiety just happens to be yours. Instead of comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own strengths and accomplishments. Celebrate the small wins, even if it's just making it through a tough day.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are so many people who understand what you're going through, and we're all rooting for you. Keep pushing forward, and don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

I think it's amazing how often our bodies react to stress before our minds even realize it's happening. It's like our bodies are trying to tell us something, but we ignore the signals until it's too late.

Your edit about getting notifications reminding you to relax is hilarious, but also kind of brilliant. Maybe we can all use a little reminder to take care of ourselves throughout the day. I'm definitely going to try setting a recurring reminder on my phone to ""unclench and relax"" - thanks for the idea!

i2jiqh,Anxiety,Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing?,xstarlesseyess,"I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!",2194,124,1596401574,"Totally get what you mean, I had/have the same issue with feeling like aaaah why am I not creating/doing useful stuff/exercising/bettering myself every minute of every day! 

I personally think it‚Äôs super common in younger folk (don‚Äôt know if that applies to you) - we‚Äôve grown up in an unstable economic situation, and we‚Äôre constantly reminded that our productivity and ability to make money define us and our futures. It‚Äôs an ingrained idea - and it‚Äôs obvious in the hustle/monetise your hobbies culture that‚Äôs so pervasive at the moment. 

That aside, being productive is great, but there are plenty of things that are equally or more valuable than being productive. Doing things you enjoy is definitely one of them! Taking time to unwind, destress, play video games, read, browse Reddit, whatever makes you happy, is a valuable and worthwhile use of your time. Is it productive? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I like to think that the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is improved mental health, relaxation, happiness - maybe not as tangible as your work days, but arguably more important. 

It‚Äôs an easy thing to accept, but hard to put into practice (from my experience, anyway). But I hope that you can work towards letting yourself have unproductive and fun days, as often as is possible - you‚Äôre only going to have one shot at life and you may as well enjoy it :)",192,wilt-ed,"Yes.

But at the same time I feel too tired to do anything.

Even ""unproductive"" things.

So I just sleep, and then feel awful about it afterwards.",41,chelledoggo,"Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's like, you're finally off work, but your brain is still in productivity mode, making you feel guilty for relaxing. I've been there too, especially since the pandemic. It's like, you're stuck at home, and it's hard to disconnect from work when your workspace is also your living space.

First off, let's acknowledge that it's okay to take a break and do nothing. You're not ""wasting"" your days off, you're recharging. Your brain needs time to unwind, and that's not always easy, especially for introverts like you who might need more alone time.

Instead of beating yourself up over what you ""should"" be doing, try to focus on what you want to do in the moment. If that's playing video games or reading a book, that's perfectly fine. And hey, if a drink or two (or a relaxing high) helps you unwind, that's okay too - just be safe and responsible about it.

Remember, your days off are for you, not for productivity or pleasing others. Take a deep breath, and give yourself permission to relax. You deserve it.","

cnmz0o,Anxiety,Anxiety is waking up 3 hours before your alarm and not being able to fall back asleep because you're worried you won't be able to fall back asleep.,Hateno,Thanks brain.,2186,103,1565276615,Or worried you‚Äôll sleep through your alarm,218,2Throwscrewsatit,,0,,"I feel you. Those pre-alarm wake-ups can be brutal. It's like your brain is trying to sabotage your sleep, and it's hard to shake off that anxiety spiral. 

Here's something that might help: when you wake up early, try not to engage with the worry thoughts. Instead, focus on your breath or a calming phrase. Remind yourself that you're awake, it's okay, and you can deal with it. 

Rather than lying in bed and stressing about not being able to fall back asleep, get up and do something relaxing, like reading a book, listening to soothing music, or practicing some gentle stretches. This can help signal to your brain that it's not time to be alert yet. 

Also, consider establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a bedtime routine, and optimizing your sleep environment. These habits can help regulate your sleep and reduce those pesky early wake-ups. Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this.","

When we're anxious about something, our minds tend to exaggerate the potential consequences, making it feel way more daunting than it actually is. But once we take the leap and face our fears, it's often a huge relief.

I think this is a great reminder to ourselves to challenge those anxious thoughts and take action despite them. Not saying it's easy, but it's definitely doable. Next time you're feeling anxious about something, try to break it down into smaller, manageable steps. This can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

You're definitely not alone in this feeling, and it's awesome that you're acknowledging and sharing it. Keep pushing through those anxious moments, and remember that the sense of accomplishment afterwards is always worth it.","

lcke3m,Anxiety,Always afraid of 'getting in trouble' - anyone else?,gedmansrevenge,"I've always been nervous about 'getting in trouble' - I'm not sure I can even put words to it exactly.  As a kid it made sense, I had super strict parents, but it's followed me into my adult life.  Like at work, I'm always anxious I'm going to get 'in trouble'.  

And when I self talk that it doesn't even make sense - like who gives a fuck?  Losing my job would suck but I've never lost a job and my boss says I'm doing well.  And yet I find myself always looking over my shoulder and feeling guilt and anxiety building if anything is going wrong or if I slack off a bit after getting work done.

I wish I could shake the tendency but I just can't seem to.  Anyone else feel this?",1990,241,1612458375,Yes I constantly think I‚Äôm doing a bad job even if I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm doing a good job. I imagine my boss considering firing me and it makes me anxious. I overanalyze every interaction we have. It‚Äôs so stressful!,463,Dpdr00,"I have a large staff, and something that often catches my attention is when I want to check in with someone, first thing I often hear is ""Am I in trouble?"" Even when I've never coached or addressed something with this person ever - I have strong relationships with my staff, lots of positive feedback over the years, and still hear this.

Here's the message I've had to push the last few years to help - ""Adults don't get into trouble. Adults are held accountable for actions.""

And accountability is NOT punishment, sometimes accountability is just a n honest conversation about what happened, why and what the plan is to fix it, with no hard feelings, no malice, only a desire to encourage and growth. I used to feel like you do, and that's largely because my parents made ""getting into trouble"" A GIANT DEAL. Punishments were frankly beyond reason, and a source of trauma. Accountability is about speaking to and taking ownership of specific actions you've taken. ""messing up"" is something that mightve gotten me punished as a child, but as an adult, I am empowered to have a plan in place to fix it. 

You're not a kid (I think)  and other adults can't punish you like a child, and if they are, quit and find a place where you esteem and respect. Why? Cuz fuck em, that's why.  

My suggestion - reach out to your manager and request a weekly review or 1x1 of your performance - or even monthly biweekly, and explain that it's to make sure you have a clear understanding of performance and where you stand. This should really be a standard in offices, but it doesn't always happen. This can help you get clear understanding which should offer stability.

Anxiety is really tough and I dealt with it  in a crippling manner for the better part of 20 years.  i am very hopeful you can find relief &lt;3",17,urinaImint,"Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I've struggled with similar feelings of anxiety and fear of 'getting in trouble' throughout my life, even when there's no logical reason to feel that way. It's like that childhood voice of ""don't get caught"" has stuck with me into adulthood.

One thing that's helped me is to recognize that this fear is often rooted in a need for control and a fear of uncertainty. When I'm feeling anxious about 'getting in trouble', I try to remind myself that I'm doing my best, and that's all anyone can ask for. I also try to reframe my thinking around 'getting in trouble' - instead of seeing it as a catastrophic event, I try to view it as an opportunity to learn and grow.

It might also be helpful to explore the root causes of this fear with a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through those underlying emotions and develop coping strategies to manage your anxiety.

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel this way. Just remember that you're doing your best, and that's something to be proud of.","

It might also be helpful to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worst-case scenarios. When someone is being nice to you or sharing something about themselves, try to appreciate the interaction for what it is, rather than analyzing it to death. Remember that people are complex and multifaceted, and it's okay if you don't know their ""true"" intentions.

POST BODY: i almost always doubt someones intentions when they are talking to me. im always worried they think im weird or annoying, and that theyd rather be someplace else. and i almost always think when someone is being nice to me, that they are not being sincere. or when they are telling me something about themselves, they are lying to see if im ""stupid enough to believe it"" or something. i know its dumb and irrational. does anyone know how to let go of this doubtfulness, because im sick and tired of having nearly every conversation be like this. i just want to be able to socialise properly lol. to be honest i think this is less a social anxiety issue and more a self esteem issue but they kinda go hand in hand so

g8v0l8,Anxiety,Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,annajac89,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing. I have a great routine now (way more balance with work/life/health than I did pre-covid) and love having more time to spend with my pets, reading &amp; contemplating. All the zoom meetings for work and maybe 1-2 virtual ‚Äúcatch ups‚Äù with friends every week are adequate for me socially. 

However when I think about how I‚Äôll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat? 

Note I‚Äôm not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù that I hated.",2001,199,1587968002,"It‚Äôs very strange to me how well I‚Äôve adapted to things. Over the past couple months I‚Äôve dropped several bad habits, some of them years old, and developed many good ones - out of necessity, mind you, but it‚Äôs been working for me. Overall, I‚Äôm in a much better headspace than I was at the start of this. 

I‚Äôm very introverted and strongly dislike my line of work, so there‚Äôs that. But my general anxiety has been much more manageable and not having to deal with the pressures of day-to-day life has been undeniably positive for me. I do miss my friends, but many of them are people I go weeks or even months without meeting with even when we‚Äôre not in quarantine.

I‚Äôm in the same boat as you - while I sincerely want covid-19 to end for the sake of the greater good, I am not ready to return to my normal life.",323,BenDanBreak,"Yes. 

Going back to work on may 11th is making me sick for several reasons.

I've been confined and working at home since march 17th. To sum up, I can't stand my collegues and hierarchy anymore. It ended in sick leave last autumn. 

So I feel better confined at home and going back to that place is disturbing me deeply already.

Moreover measures for social distancing at work have not been decided yet, but I fear the worse. There's some people who clearly doesn't care about personal space and I don't want to meet them.

School is supposed to start again on may 11th, but a majority of parents won't put their kids back and won't return to work. As a child-free woman, again i will be forced to do my collegues job in addition to mine (I'm already several months late on some subjects) and as usual, I will get no help in return only a pat on the head.

Sorry this looks like a vent, but I fear all the job I did with my therapist have been pointless.",29,Shaka38,"I completely get where you're coming from. It's almost like you've discovered a new sense of balance and control in your life, and the thought of giving that up is daunting. It's not about wishing the pandemic would continue, but rather about the uncertainty and discomfort of returning to a routine that didn't serve you.

Firstly, acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's normal to feel anxious about change, especially when it involves going back to something that wasn't working for you.

Rather than focusing on the anxiety of going back to the old grind, maybe try to think about what aspects of your current routine you can maintain when things go back to ""normal"". Can you negotiate flexible work arrangements? Can you prioritize self-care and make time for your pets, reading, and contemplation?

Remember that you've grown and adapted so much during this time, and that's something to be proud of. You have the power to create a new normal that works for you, even if it's not exactly the same as your pre-pandemic life.","

It sounds simple, but just acknowledging that I'm feeling anxious and giving myself permission to take a break can make a huge difference. Sometimes that means saying, 'hey, I need a minute' and stepping away from the situation. Other times it means just taking a few deep breaths and reminding myself that I can handle this.

It's also helped me to practice self-compassion and remind myself that it's okay to not be okay. I'm not a monster for snapping at someone - I'm just a human who's struggling. And that's something to be kind to, not beat myself up over.""","

I think it's really interesting that you bring up the idea that these experiences might've made you better. I believe that's true. Our mistakes and struggles can be incredible teachers, and it's clear that you've learned from yours.

When those anxious nights come around, try to practice some self-compassion. Remind yourself that you did the best you could with what you knew at the time, and that's all anyone can ask for. It might also help to reframe those memories as opportunities for growth, rather than sources of shame.

You're not alone in this, and it's amazing that you're willing to confront these feelings head-on. Keep taking care of yourself, and remember that you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of.","

Only every time I talk to someone.",264,tontovila,"Oh yeah sure. 

Couple weeks ago I was at a backyard movie night with some local friends. I'm not a big social person, and they know it, but either way I really don't have much a problem hanging out by myself or taking a break if I need. 

Anyhow.

One of the wives starts to chit chat with me, and is like *what have you been up to lately?* and honestly, the real answer is not much, working, exercising, riding my bike, walking the dog, that sort of thing, and she's like *come on throw me a bone, you have to be up to something new*, so I'm like *oh I am, I bought a jump rope the other day, and after struggling a bit I can do a couple reps of a hundred each without fucking up. You should try it, it's fun,* and that ended the conversation.

Later, I was really wondering if maybe she felt I was implying that she needed to exercise more, and it bugged me for a solid couple days. Really though, I feel like I'm pretty good at squashing that type of feeling, and generally it's just my brain being a pain in the ass, so I'm good, but it happens.",3,Scapular_Fin,"I totally get it. I've been there too, replaying conversations in my head and cringing at things I said or did. It's like our brains have a built-in ""critic mode"" that just can't be satisfied. 

First of all, just want to say that you're not alone in this. A lot of people struggle with social anxiety and post-interaction rumination. It's actually a pretty common phenomenon, especially for people who are naturally more self-aware and reflective.

One thing that's helped me is to practice self-compassion and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes. I mean, nobody is perfect, and people are usually more focused on themselves than on judging us. I also try to reframe my thinking by focusing on the positive aspects of the interaction, like the good times we had or the meaningful conversations we shared.

Another strategy is to set a ""worry time limit"" ‚Äì like, give yourself 30 minutes to think about the conversation, and then consciously let it go. It's not always easy, but it can help you break the cycle of anxiety.","

I've always been an overthinker and escapist too, often finding solace in fictional worlds. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to have a rich inner life, especially if you're an empathetic person. Your ability to imagine and connect with characters is actually a strength, not a weakness.

However, it's understandable that you're wondering if this is still a healthy coping mechanism at 22. While it's okay to take refuge in fantasy, it's also important to find balance in your life. Try to set aside time for both escapism and real-life interactions. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and nurture your relationships.

Remember, it's not about cutting off your imagination completely, but about finding a balance that works for you. You can still be a dreamer and live in the real world. And hey, being an adult doesn't mean you have to give up on fantasy altogether ‚Äì it just means you're learning to navigate both worlds.""","

I can totally understand how overwhelming anxiety can be, especially in situations like job interviews. It's amazing that you pushed through those feelings and nailed the interview.

I love that you acknowledged the inevitable anxiety that might come with your first day on the job, but you're not letting it hold you back. That's the key - recognizing those feelings, but not giving in to them.

Your story is a great reminder that our comfort zones often hold us back from achieving our true potential. It's awesome that you're taking this opportunity to grow and challenge yourself.

Also, kudos on negotiating a higher salary - that's a great confidence booster. Remember that your worth and value are reflected in your achievements, not just your anxiety. Keep pushing forward, and I'm sure you'll continue to crush it. Thanks for sharing your inspiring story with us!""","

hylc6u,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxious when being yelled at, or just hearing someone raise their voice?",rlyns319,I've noticed here recently that my chest gets tight and I can hardly breathe when being yelled at or hearing someone raise their voice in general. Does anyone have a way to calm themselves when this happens?,1970,162,1595823131,"I don't have any advice, but yeah, I don't like people yelling or raising their voices. I've never liked conflict, even if it wasn't directed at me. I used to cry even at 17 as my dad yelled at my addict and alcoholic older brother. If I didn't mind my dad yelling, I wouldn't still be having nightmares about arguments 5 years after moving out. People lecturing me/talking to me in a disapproving way is enough to make me cry and shut down. Something in particular comes to mind. I also had nightmares from that. I've tried explaining to people even if they aren't physically yelling at me, my reaction is no different than if they were. It's all the same to me if someone is upset with me. 

I have to remind my husband to not raise his voice when we are debating/disagreeing on something unimportant.",233,SensitiveBugGirl,[deleted],1,[deleted],"I totally get it. I've been there too, and it's like my body's immediate response is 'fight or flight.' For me, it's not just about the yelling itself, but the feeling of being on edge and not knowing how to react. 

One thing that's helped me calm down in those situations is taking a few deep breaths and reminding myself that it's not about me - it's about the other person's emotions. It sounds simple, but it really helps to separate myself from the situation.

Another thing you could try is practicing some grounding techniques. For example, focusing on your five senses - the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin. It can help bring you back to the present moment and calm you down.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it doesn't mean you're weak. It's just your body's way of responding to stress. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to manage it.","

If you don't mind me asking, what do you think helped you feel more confident and comfortable during that drive? Was there anything specific that you did to prepare or any mindset shifts that you made?

Keep celebrating this win and know that you're capable of more than you think. You got this, and I'm rooting for you to continue pushing past your comfort zone.""","

I've been there too - looking back, I wish I'd been more outgoing and taken more risks, but at the same time, I know that my anxiety would've probably made those experiences more stressful than enjoyable.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on the things that I do enjoy and make me feel good about myself, even if they're not the same things as my friends or peers. It's not about comparing yourself to others, but about finding your own path and what brings you happiness.

It's also worth remembering that just because you didn't have the same experiences as others, it doesn't mean that your life is any less valid or valuable. Your experiences, even if they're not the same as others, are still worth something, and you can still learn and grow from them. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the present and what you can control. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.""","

I just recently moved back home to be with family and got a new job around October. Everything was great and I felt like I was thriving.

As time goes on, it's natural to shift focus from the immediate health concerns to the long-term financial implications. It's especially tough when you have big life events on the horizon and everything feels uncertain.

One thing that might help is to break down your financial concerns into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of worrying about the entire 12-18 month period, try focusing on the next 3-6 months. What can you do now to prepare and adapt? Can you review your budget, cut back on non-essentials, or start building an emergency fund?

It's also important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people are going through similar struggles, and there are resources available to help. Look into local and national support programs, and consider reaching out to a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Lastly, try to focus on what you can control, and take things one step at a time. It's okay to feel anxious, but don't let it overwhelm you. You've got this, and you'll navigate this uncertainty with time.","

fo6h6w,Anxiety,Anyone else have to keep reminding themselves the tightness in their chest is probably just anxiety?,Big-Setting,"I‚Äôve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, especially after my job closing due to the covid-19 pandemic.  I keep feeling tightness in my chest and then get stressed worrying I might have a mild case.  Then I have to stop and put myself in check.  Do I have a fever?  No.  Body aches and chills?  No.  Dry cough?  No.  Does anyone else have to keep themselves in check like this?",1802,268,1585061921,Yup my main symptoms are always chest pain and shortness of breath to the point I feel like yawning and gasping for air. Right now I have had a super dry throat and a sensation of having something stuck there for about three weeks and a cough that I think is me trying to get rid of that sensation. Of course this is making me panic more but I'm trying to remind myself the the mind is a crazy thing and all of these sensations are commonly experienced as a symptom of anxiety. It's like I'm sabotaging myself by knowing those of the symptoms and manifesting them. Still freaking out though,288,lunavenusian,"I feel so stupid constantly getting caught off guard by the same chest tightness over and over again.

It's like, your brain is already on high alert with all the stress and anxiety, and then your body throws in some physical sensations that just fuel the panic. I've been there too, and it's exhausting.

First of all, just want to acknowledge that it's amazing you're taking the time to check in with yourself and rationalize your symptoms. That takes a lot of self-awareness and emotional regulation.

One thing that might help is to remind yourself that it's normal for anxiety to manifest physically, especially in your chest. It's like your body's ""fight or flight"" response is on overdrive. When you start to feel that tightness, try taking a few deep breaths, and focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. It can help calm your nervous system and remind you that you're safe.

Remember, it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed, but it sounds like you're doing a great job of managing your anxiety. Keep taking care of yourself, and try to focus on the things that bring you calm and comfort.","

I've been there too, hesitating to post because of the fear of being judged or downvoted into oblivion. It's not silly at all - Reddit can be a tough crowd, and it's natural to want to avoid potential criticism.

Here's the thing: most people on Reddit aren't trying to be harsh or judgmental. They're just passionate about the topics they're discussing, and sometimes that passion can come out as strong opinions. It's not personal.

If you're still feeling anxious about posting, try this: take a deep breath, write your post, and then walk away from it for a bit. Come back to it later with fresh eyes, and ask yourself if it's really something you're worried about. Chances are, it's not as big of a deal as you think. And if you do get some negative feedback, try not to take it personally. Remember, you're not defined by your Reddit posts. You're a person with valuable thoughts and experiences to share.","

j61jth,Anxiety,You are safe,[deleted],"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You‚Äôre not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, ‚ÄúI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It‚Äôs okay. I got this.‚Äù (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

The lady at Wendy's was really nice to me and gave me extra bacon and I almost cried. Made me feel motivated to try to live life more.,220,torystory,"This post brought tears to my eyes. I needed to read this today, and I'm sure many others did too. It's so easy to get caught up in our fears and feel like we're not good enough or that something is wrong with us. But your words are a beautiful reminder that we are loved, we are safe, and we are deserving of kindness - not just from others, but from ourselves.

I especially resonated with the idea of finding love in the little moments - a stranger's smile, a courteous driver, a friendly store clerk. These small acts can bring so much comfort and joy. And I love the idea of radiating love and safety, not just receiving it.

To anyone reading this, take a deep breath and hold yourself tight. You are loved, you are safe, and you are enough. Don't abandon yourself in times of fear or uncertainty. Instead, be kind, gentle, and compassionate. Remember that you're not alone, and that there are people out there who care about you deeply. Thank you for this beautiful reminder.","

POST TITLE: You are safe

POST BODY: Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You‚Äôre not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

uxeqkv,Anxiety,I don't think a lot of people realise how much of a disability anxiety can be.,Anxietyshmuck,"Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction",1846,156,1653476118,"Not to mention it's physically exhausting too. Panic attacks, not being able to sleep because your brain won't stop the anxious thoughts, just being constantly on edge takes a toll on the body.",530,1-A_Rep,,0,,"I completely understand where you're coming from. It's like having a constant voice in your head telling you that you're not good enough, and it can be exhausting. I've found that it's helpful to reframe my thinking around confidence - instead of trying to be this outgoing, self-assured person, I focus on being brave and taking small steps outside my comfort zone.

It's not about pretending to be someone I'm not, but about being willing to face my fears and doubts head-on. And it's okay to not be okay - it's okay to take things at my own pace and to prioritize my own well-being. I think it's also important to remember that anxiety is not something to be ashamed of. It's a legitimate struggle, and it's not a reflection of my worth as a person.

If you don't mind me asking, what are some things that have helped you cope with your anxiety? I'm always looking for new strategies and support.","

I too, have found the mask-wearing experience to be somewhat liberating in a weird way. It's almost like it gives you a sense of anonymity, and you don't have to worry about making small talk or putting on a smile for everyone you meet. It's nice to have a break from those social expectations.

That being said, I do think it's great that you're acknowledging the potential struggle of adjusting back to 'normal' when the time comes. It might be helpful to start thinking about small ways you can maintain that sense of comfort and confidence when the masks come off. Maybe it's about setting boundaries or being more intentional about the social interactions you engage in.

Just remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace, and you don't have to go back to 'before' if that doesn't feel right for you. You can use this experience as an opportunity to re-evaluate what works for you and what doesn't.""","

oe663e,Anxiety,"anyone else get nervous before EVERYTHING including fun things, rather than getting excited?",Ash1Kozmo,"and it's not clear why you're nervous, it's not like a ""I'm nervous about this"" it's more of a ""i'm just nervous""",1868,128,1625487343,"This is actually how I know I've had anxiety since childhood. When I was a kid, I would get so excited the night before/morning of an event (sometimes as small as a trip to the park) that I would get violently physically ill. I ruined a lot of my own birthday parties this way because my parents would need to cancel because I was so sick. I would start off with physical illness, then I'd start to get really upset (now I know these were panic attacks) and cry. 

Even as an adult I have this problem from time to time. Now I am able to calm myself down, but as a kid it was a complete nightmare. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.",263,courtneat,You've got anxiety by the sounds of it my friend. Welcome.,31,MadMatticus21,"I totally get it. I'm the same way - I can be nervous about anything, even things I'm really looking forward to. It's like my brain just defaults to ""worst-case scenario"" mode, no matter what.

One thing that's helped me is to try to reframe my nervousness as excitement. I know it sounds weird, but hear me out - our bodies can't always tell the difference between excitement and anxiety, so I try to tell myself that my nervous energy is actually just my body getting ready for something fun.

Another thing that's helped is to focus on the present moment. Instead of getting caught up in worries about the future or past, I try to bring myself back to what's happening right now. It's hard to be nervous when you're fully engaged in the present.

Lastly, just know that you're not alone in this. It's totally normal to feel nervous, even when you're looking forward to something. You're not broken or weird - you're just wired to be a little more cautious, and that's okay.","

I think we've all been there at some point, where the pain or struggle becomes so familiar that we start to think it's just our new normal.

For me, it's about taking small steps towards self-care and doing things that bring me joy, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Whether it's reading a chapter in a book, taking a walk, or cooking a favorite meal, those little moments can help shift our perspective and remind us that happiness is still possible.

Another thing that might help is recognizing the emotions behind your impulse to apologize. Are you feeling anxious, self-conscious, or seeking validation? Once you're aware of the underlying emotions, you can work on addressing them in healthier ways. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and take up space ‚Äì you don't need to apologize for being yourself. You're not alone in this, and breaking the habit takes time and practice, but it's worth it.

One thing that's helped me is experimenting with tiny amounts of coffee, like a quarter of a cup or even just a few sips. It's not the same as a full cup, but it can give me just enough of a boost to get through the day without sending my anxiety into overdrive. Another thing I've tried is switching to herbal teas or decaf coffee, which can give me a similar energy boost without the jitters.

I never thought I‚Äôd be able to do this honestly. I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job. 

I even opened up a bank account today for myself. 

Sure, I‚Äôm anxious about starting work and worried I‚Äôm gonna be bad at it..but that‚Äôs a problem for me later. Right now im thrilled I even did it. It can get better y‚Äôall.

Edit: thank you all for all the nice comments :)

hhi5y0,Anxiety,I lost my companion of 18 years. People don‚Äôt understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.,IUMogg,"I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I wish you peace and healing.,151,thelibrarina,,0,,"I can only imagine the depth of the bond you shared with your cat, and it's beautiful to see how much he meant to you. As someone who likely understands the complexities of mental health, I want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and deserve space to be processed. It's not just about losing a pet; it's about losing a source of comfort, companionship, and unconditional love.

It's wonderful that you have a supportive fianc√© and a great support system. Allow yourself to lean on them during this difficult time, and don't hesitate to reach out to a therapist if you need additional guidance. Grief can be overwhelming, especially when it's intertwined with existing mental health concerns.

Your cat may be gone, but his impact on your life will remain. Take time to celebrate his memory, and remember the lessons he taught you about resilience, love, and companionship. You are not alone in your grief, and this community is here to offer support and understanding.","

It‚Äôs the busiest season for my niche-insurance market and I‚Äôm tired from working 45-50hr work weeks. My anxiety keeps me from taking off work knowing I‚Äôll feel guilty for not helping the company when they need me the most. 

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for ‚Äúoutstanding attendance‚Äù which quickly made me realize I‚Äôm the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break.

Sometimes she stays up until 11 or 12 doing it. And high school has caused her a lot of anxiety. She asked one day if she could take a mental day off. I said ‚Äúof course!‚Äù Our mental well being is more important. Anxiety can cause many health issues.

First of all, congrats on recognizing your burnout and taking that day off - it's a huge step. It's ironic that you were recognized for ""outstanding attendance"" when in reality, it's probably a sign that you needed a break.

Here's the thing: taking care of your mental health is not a luxury, it's a necessity. Your company needs you to be at your best, and if that means taking a day or two off to recharge, then so be it. It's not selfish, it's self-care. 

Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to reframe your thinking around taking time off. Instead of feeling guilty, remind yourself that you're doing it to come back stronger and more focused. You got this, and it's okay to prioritize your well-being.","

It's like your mind is constantly juggling 'now' and 'later', making it impossible to fully enjoy the present. That impending phone call can be a nagging cloud, casting a shadow over an otherwise sunny day.

I want you to know that you're not alone in this feeling. It's actually a common aspect of anxiety ‚Äì our brains are wired to prepare for potential threats, even if they're minor and far-off. But it's great that you're acknowledging and talking about it.

When I find myself in a similar situation, I try to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of worrying about the entire phone call, I focus on the tiny steps leading up to it ‚Äì making a plan, writing down key points, or even just setting a reminder. It helps to make the task feel less overwhelming.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it's amazing that you're sharing this with us. You're helping others feel less alone, and that's something to be proud of.","

gzqpsw,Anxiety,I think I prefer depression over anxiety,flathamster,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable.

It's like your brain is exhausted from being on high alert all the time, and the numbness of depression can be a weird kind of relief.

Your edit is so on point, though. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that the change is an improvement, when really it's just trading one set of problems for another. But I think it's great that you're acknowledging this and encouraging others not to get complacent.

For me, therapy has been a game-changer in helping me find some stability and energy. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. If you haven't already, I hope you'll consider reaching out for support - whether that's therapy, a support group, or just talking to a trusted friend or family member. You deserve to feel more than just ""good enough.""","

Clearing out physical clutter can be such a powerful way to clear mental space, and it sounds like you're setting yourself up for success. Donating your old clothes is also a great way to let go of the past and make room for new experiences.

Starting therapy can be intimidating, but it's amazing that you're taking proactive steps towards your mental health. Remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace, and don't hesitate to be honest with your therapist about what you're feeling. They're there to support you!

As for the job interview, you've got this! You've already shown that you're capable of taking action and making positive changes in your life. Just be yourself, and remember that it's okay to not have all the answers. You're already doing something to be proud of, and whatever happens, you'll come out of this experience stronger and wiser.

Here's a piece of advice: don't be too hard on yourself about not having a huge social circle just yet. Focus on building connections with people who share similar interests, like online communities or hobby groups. It might take time, but you'll find your tribe.

You deserve to be celebrated, and I'm glad we could all be a part of making your day a little brighter. Take care, and I hope your year ahead is filled with growth, self-love, and lots of happy moments.""","

It's like, every little symptom can send our anxiety-ridden brains into overdrive. I've been there too, constantly Googling my symptoms and wondering if it's just anxiety or something more serious. 

One thing that has helped me is trying to focus on the physical sensations in my body, rather than my mind's interpretation of them. For example, instead of thinking ""Oh no, I'm short of breath, I must have corona!"", try to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Is it really labored, or is it just your mind playing tricks on you?

It's also worth reminding yourself that anxiety can manifest physically, and it's not uncommon for people to experience shortness of breath during anxiety attacks. That being said, if you're really concerned, it's always better to err on the side of caution and talk to a doctor. They can assess your symptoms and give you a proper diagnosis.","

When masks do become less common, try to focus on the progress you've made and the confidence you've gained.

As someone who's experienced panic attacks firsthand, it can be really frustrating when people use the term to describe a minor freakout. It's not just about being nervous for a sec ‚Äì it's a full-blown, debilitating experience that can leave you shaken for hours.

I think part of the problem is that people just don't understand what a panic attack is. They think it's just a fancy way of saying ""I'm really anxious,"" but it's so much more than that. It's a physical and mental response that can be overwhelming and terrifying.

If you feel comfortable, try explaining what a panic attack really feels like to the people who use the term loosely. Sometimes, all it takes is a little education to help people understand the difference. And if they still don't get it, well, at least you know you've tried. Thanks for speaking up and advocating for those of us who live with anxiety and panic disorders.","

Hope you have a blessed day too!",104,ButterBrownie,"I needed this reminder today, and I'm sure I'm not alone. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life and put our own well-being on the backburner, but it's so important to remember that we can't pour from an empty cup.

One thing that's helped me prioritize my mental health is setting small, achievable boundaries for myself. Whether it's taking a 10-minute walk during my lunch break or saying no to social invitations that feel overwhelming, acknowledging my limits and respecting them has made a huge difference.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, I encourage you to take a step back and assess what's truly non-negotiable today. Can you reschedule that meeting or delegate a task to someone else? Remember that taking care of yourself isn't selfish - it's necessary. You're not alone, and your mental health matters.","

Anxiety and stomach issues go hand in hand for many people, and it's like your brain is trying to sabotage you even more when you're already feeling nervous.

First of all, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you've been told you're doing great. It's amazing that you're acknowledging your flaws, but try not to let them define your self-worth. Performance reviews can be tough, but they're also an opportunity for growth and learning.

As for the bathroom breaks, maybe try to take some time to relax and calm down throughout the day. Take a short walk, do some deep breathing exercises, or listen to calming music. Also, make sure you're staying hydrated and eating something gentle on your stomach.

You got this, and your self-review will be a great way to prepare for tomorrow. Remember that it's okay to have flaws, and it doesn't mean you're not doing a great job. You're going to crush that review, and I'm sending you all the positive vibes.","

It might take some experimentation, but it's worth it. Try to take small steps towards living more mindfully, like taking a few deep breaths before you leave the house or practicing positive self-talk.

First of all, let me tell you that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling vulnerable. So, kudos to you for taking the first step and sharing this with us.

First of all, let me just say that you're not alone in this feeling. I think most people have been there at some point or another. For me, what helps is to remind myself that I'm not posting for the validation of strangers. I'm posting because I want to share something that I think is worth sharing.

Try to focus on the act of sharing itself, rather than the potential outcome. And when you do get negative feedback (because, let's face it, it's gonna happen sometimes), try not to take it personally. Remember that people's opinions are often a reflection of themselves, not you or your idea.

Lastly, just take a deep breath and hit that 'post' button. It might feel scary at first, but the more you do it, the easier it gets.","

Your therapist's words are so spot on - mental illness doesn't care about logic or reason. It's like having a hyper-vigilant security system that's always on high alert. Giving yourself grace and compassion is key. Remember that your brain is trying to protect you, even if it's going about it in a way that feels overwhelming or irrational.

As for coping, I've found that breaking down my tasks into smaller, manageable chunks helps me feel more in control. It's also super helpful to have a calming pre-bed routine, like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches.

It's like you're aware of the irrational thoughts, but your brain just won't cooperate. I've been there too, and it can be really frustrating.

One thing that might help is to focus on acknowledging and accepting those anxious feelings, rather than trying to fight them. It sounds counterintuitive, but sometimes trying to suppress or change our emotions can actually make them worse. Instead, try to observe them with curiosity, like you're a scientist studying a phenomenon. Recognize that those feelings are there, but they don't define your worth or reality.

Another strategy is to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious, and that you're doing the best you can. You're already taking a huge step by recognizing your cognitive distortions, so give yourself some credit for that.

Lastly, consider seeking out mindfulness or acceptance-based therapies, like ACT or MBCT. They can help you develop a more nuanced relationship with your thoughts and emotions. You got this, and you're not alone in this struggle.","

Firstly, allow yourself to feel drained and take all the time you need to recharge. It's completely normal to feel that way after such a big emotional release. As for responding to comments, don't stress about it - we're all here to support you, and we'll be here whenever you're ready to engage.

Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You're taking control of your mental health, and that's something to be incredibly proud of. Keep going, even if it feels like the smallest step forward. You've got this, and we've got your back.""","

jgczkl,Anxiety,I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized &amp; social anxiety disorder.,capo-22,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression &amp; anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",1705,128,1603415517,Thank you for posting this.

I‚Äôve gotten very good at faking it and I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. I‚Äôm on day 10 of Zoloft and hoping for a bit of relief soon,226,suckerv,"I completely get it. It's exhausting to put on a mask every day, isn't it? I've been there too, and it's like you're living two separate lives - the one everyone sees, and the one you're actually living. 

First of all, I want you to know that you're not alone, and it's okay to feel this way. It's amazing that you're acknowledging your struggles and taking care of yourself (working out, eating healthy, etc.) despite everything. That takes a lot of strength.

Remember that you don't have to show your true self to everyone. It's okay to keep some things private, but it's also important to find people you can trust and be open with. Sharing your struggles with a therapist, support group, or close friends can be incredibly liberating.

Lastly, try to be kinder to yourself. You're not a loser, and you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of. Keep going, even when it feels like the smallest step. You're not alone, and you're doing better than you think.","

I've had similar experiences with anxiety where my mind would get overwhelmed and I'd catch myself having internal conversations with people I know. It's like my brain is trying to process everything and work through emotions, but it can feel really isolating.

First of all, just want to say that you're not alone in this. I think it's actually more common than you think, and it's a sign that your brain is actively trying to cope with stress and anxiety.

One thing that might help is to acknowledge these internal conversations as a symptom of your anxiety, rather than beating yourself up over it. Try to be kind to yourself and recognize that it's a way your brain is trying to release tension.

Also, consider journaling or talking to a trusted friend/family member about what's going on. Sometimes just putting your thoughts into words can help you feel more grounded and less alone. You're doing a great job articulating your feelings, and that's something to be proud of.","

kk6u2r,Anxiety,The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,[deleted],"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am ‚Äúinfected‚Äù so he often won‚Äôt stay in the same room as me, sometimes won‚Äôt talk to me, races away from me and won‚Äôt touch things that I‚Äôve touched.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

Not only did you have a good day today receiving love from him, please understand he probably had an even better day because he just made huge progress with his battle with OCD.

I am very impressed someone at such a young age was able to shut down those thoughts for once. 

Godspeed.",159,AfroDevil30,[removed],-14,[deleted],"I can only imagine how tough this past year must have been for you and your son. It's heartbreaking to see him struggling with OCD, and I'm sure it's been especially hard for you, feeling like you're being ""pushed away"" by someone you love.

But that hug on Christmas - oh, what a beautiful moment. It's clear your son is working hard to overcome his struggles, and it's amazing that he was able to push through his anxiety to give you that gift. And I love that he said you could hug him for as long as you wanted - that must have been such a relief and a comfort for both of you.

It's also wonderful that your older son is looking out for you, especially during this transition to being a single woman. It's clear your sons are empathetic and caring, and that's a testament to the love and support you've provided them.

Remember to be patient and understanding with your son as he navigates his OCD. Celebrate these small victories, and know that every step forward, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction.","

Quarantine can be a weirdly comfortable bubble, and the thought of bursting back into the hustle and bustle of normal life can be overwhelming. It's almost like you've been in a state of suspended animation, and now you're expected to just... wake up and be back to normal.

First of all, let me tell you that it's okay to feel anxious about this. It's a big change, and it's normal to feel uncertain about how you'll adjust. One thing that might help is to start small. Instead of thinking about everything you need to do all at once, break it down into tiny, manageable tasks. Like, what's one thing you can do today to start getting back into the swing of things? Maybe it's just taking a short walk outside, or making a phone call to a friend.

Remember, you don't have to have it all figured out right now. Take your time, and be kind to yourself as you navigate this transition. You're not alone in feeling this way, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.","

I want to acknowledge how brave you are for taking that first step and posting. It's a huge accomplishment, and I'm proud of you! Remember that everyone starts somewhere, and the fact that you've been lurking means you've already been taking small steps towards seeking help and connection.

If you feel comfortable, I encourage you to keep sharing and engaging with the community. Your voice matters, and your experiences can help others feel less alone. And if not, that's okay too. Just knowing that you're not alone in your struggles can be a powerful thing. Keep taking small steps, and remember to be kind to yourself along the way.""","

gwfrjt,Anxiety,Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,kukkelii,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds.

I can only imagine how frustrating it must be to have your concerns dismissed by medical professionals, family, and friends. It's like they're not seeing the full picture - that for you, getting to work is a monumental task that requires a lot of effort and support.

I'm glad to hear that you're working on your diet and exercise, and that you're trying to find ways to manage your IBS and anxiety. It's great that you're taking proactive steps to improve your situation.

I'm not a medical professional, but it seems like what you need is a more holistic approach to your treatment - one that takes into account your anxiety, IBS, and your goals. Have you considered seeking out a therapist who specializes in anxiety and trauma? Sometimes having someone to talk to who truly understands can make all the difference.

Keep pushing forward, and don't give up on finding the right support. You got this!","

homwjx,Anxiety,I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.,protodro,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.",1689,103,1594378697,"Same.

It's heartbreaking that you were punished for something that wasn't your fault, especially when you were just a child who needed comfort and reassurance. It's no wonder that you've developed a pattern of anxiety and panic when you make mistakes.

I want to encourage you to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through this. It might take time to unlearn these patterns, but with self-awareness and a willingness to change, you can develop a more compassionate response to mistakes. Remember that mistakes are a natural part of growth and learning, and it's okay not to be perfect.

Keep in mind that you can't change your past, but you can work on creating a more loving and accepting present for yourself. You got this, and you deserve it.","

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.

dgedyv,Anxiety,Skipping classes for my mental health...which impacts my grades...which impacts my mental health.,nikktea,‚ú® college ‚ú®,1708,78,1570796613,Exactly what happens to me. I did it on school and now I do it with work...,176,Today-is-cancelled,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get it. It's like being stuck in a vicious cycle, and it's exhausting. I want you to know that taking care of your mental health is not selfish; it's essential. Skipping classes might seem counterintuitive, but if it's what you need to recharge and cope, then it's a necessary evil.

Here's a thought: instead of beating yourself up over the grades, try talking to your professors or a academic advisor about your situation. They might be more understanding than you think, and some universities even offer accommodations for students with mental health concerns.

In the meantime, consider reaching out to your school's counseling services or a therapist who can help you develop coping strategies. It's okay to ask for help, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the importance of your mental well-being.

Remember, your grades don't define your worth, and it's okay to prioritize your mental health. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep taking care of yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself, okay?","

When I get like this I get super irritated by people talking and loud noises. Does this happen to anyone else? Sometimes it gets to the point where I want to put in headphones to drown out the noises I can‚Äôt control.,1621,160,1580685031,"Sensory overload. It's pretty common amongst people with anxiety, adhd, and autism to name some common ones. Bonus points if you have more than one",314,Lloptyr,"I'm sort of the other way around. Certain noises MAKE me anxious and angry. Chewing, screeching, rubbing. It gets under my skin.",69,RyunWould,"I totally get what you're going through. I've experienced this hyper-sensitivity to noise when I'm anxious too. It's like my brain is already on high alert, and every little sound feels magnified. I've found that it's not just the noise itself, but also the feeling of being overwhelmed by the stimuli around me.

One thing that's helped me is to practice grounding techniques when I start feeling anxious. Deep breathing, focusing on my five senses, or doing some quick progressive muscle relaxation can help calm me down and reduce the intensity of the noise. I've also started carrying earplugs or headphones with me, not just to block out the noise, but also as a coping mechanism to feel more in control.

Remember, you're not alone in this. It's a common symptom of anxiety, and there are ways to manage it. Try to be kind to yourself and take care of your needs in those moments. And hey, putting in headphones is totally okay ‚Äì do what you need to do to feel more comfortable.","

I feel like I have to continuously distract myself to stay more calm, but this isn‚Äôt always best either cause then I feel like I‚Äôm not experiencing my feelings or emotions like I should.",156,Ms-Chanandl3r-Bong,"Does anybody get brief scares feeling like you‚Äôre watching your body move without your knowledge, and then you start to get chills? Also does anybody see little dots of light in your vision?",2,OnyxMist08,"I totally feel you on this one. It's like your brain is constantly looking for things to worry about, and when it can't find anything, it's like, ""Wait, what if I'm not anxious? Is everything okay? No, something must be wrong."" It's this weird catch-22 where you're anxious about not being anxious.

First of all, just acknowledge that this is a really common experience, especially for people who are used to feeling anxious. It's like your brain is trying to self-regulate and can't quite figure out how to chill.

One thing that might help is to try to focus on the present moment. Instead of worrying about whether you're anxious or not, try to focus on your breath, your surroundings, or whatever you're doing in the moment. Mindfulness can be really helpful in calming down that anxious brain.

Also, just remember that it's okay to not be anxious all the time. It's okay to feel calm and relaxed. You don't have to be constantly on edge to be ""normal.""","

n1smxe,Anxiety,"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.",hey_hi_hello73,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",1658,110,1619785178,"I do not know how you will feel and experience the after effects of this. I'm not sure if my advice will help you. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the thought of how myself, my loved ones, and my dog could be injured while I am driving them around. And then I go for a few short drives to a nearby drivethrough to help normalise it in my head again.

This part I'm not sure will help, but it helps me. Tragedies can occur at any moment whether you're in a car or not. They provide such great quality of life, I'm willing to risk the danger of driving. I'm not willing to risk the danger of not driving. I can drive people to the hospital. I can drive people to school and work, and greatly improve the quality of their life.

I remind myself that cars are designed to be struck. You could have been a walking pedestrian when that car went off the road, but you were in your car. You were in the safest place you could possibly be. Your car did a good job. I'm so thankful that your car was there for you.

Your experience sounds like a really scary one. I would be quite shaken up for a while. When you get a car again, I would make your first drive to a fun place. Maybe a nearby garden centre? And you can try to look forward to it in the meantime.",358,LovesRabbits,Oh that‚Äôs so horrible! Sometimes things like that happen....you always think it won‚Äôt happen to you until it does right? The worst part about it is now driving will be another trigger for your anxiety because of ptsd! Hope things get better for u....I will send positive vibes ur way ;),178,Snowfreak2507,"I'm so, so sorry to hear that this happened to you. It's absolutely terrifying, and I can only imagine how overwhelming it must have felt, especially on top of an already intense panic attack. 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that your quick thinking and decision to pull over to the side of the road likely saved your life, and that's something to be incredibly proud of. It's not your fault that someone else's reckless behavior put you in harm's way.

It's completely understandable that you're worried about the potential impact on your anxiety and PTSD. It's possible that you might experience some symptoms, but it's also important to remember that you've already shown incredible resilience and resourcefulness in the face of a traumatic event. 

Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies. They can also help you work through any potential PTSD symptoms that may arise. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there's support available to you. Sending you all the best and a big virtual hug.","

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won‚Äôt avoid your replies üòÜ

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else‚Äôs experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

I haaaate iiiiiit.",81,M4dScientist1,"I completely understand where you're coming from. I've experienced a similar type of anxiety with e-correspondence, especially when it feels like there's pressure to respond quickly. It's like the weight of the message is just sitting there, waiting for me to deal with it.

I think you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. It's exhausting, both mentally and emotionally.

One thing that's helped me is to try and reframe my thinking around responding to messages. Instead of feeling like I need to respond right away, I remind myself that it's okay to take my time. I also try to prioritize my responses, focusing on the ones that are most important or urgent.

It's also great that you're acknowledging the impact of the lockdown on your mental health. Make sure to take care of yourself and find ways to manage your anxiety, whether it's through exercise, meditation, or just taking a relaxing bath.

I've seen so many great questions and discussions get lost in the noise because they just didn't get enough visibility. It's not about feeling obligated to write a long, thoughtful comment ‚Äì sometimes, just showing that you see and appreciate someone's content can make a big difference.

Upvoting is a great way to do just that, and it's amazing how much of an impact it can have. I've had posts of my own get stuck in limbo, only to suddenly get a bunch of upvotes and comments after one or two people decided to give them a boost.

So, to everyone out there, let's make an effort to support each other's content, even if it's just a quick upvote. It might not seem like much, but trust me, it can make someone's day. And who knows, you might just help someone get the help or feedback they need. Thanks for posting this, OP ‚Äì let's keep the community spirit alive!","

First of all, kudos to you for being brave enough to share your struggles. That's not always easy. Now, I'm not saying this is a solution, but have you tried talking to your girlfriend about how you feel like you're not being heard? She might be more willing to listen and offer support than you think. It's also possible that she's feeling overwhelmed by her own struggles and doesn't know how to help you.

If talking to her doesn't feel like an option, you might consider joining a support group or online community for men with anxiety and depression. It can be really helpful to connect with others who understand what you're going through. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to listen.","

I attended an event yesterday I‚Äôve been extremely worried about for the past couple weeks and the second I got in the car to leave it‚Äôs like my sickness just disappeared completely and I felt on cloud 9.

I also read somewhere as kids when our stomach is constantly aching and you feel ill but unsure why, anxiety. Of course everyone has it differently, but yeah sorry you were feeling that way.",9,casere496,"""I completely understand what you're going through. Anxiety can manifest physically in so many ways, and it's crazy how often we get fooled into thinking it's a physical illness. I've been there too, where I'm convinced I've got the flu or something, only to realize it's just my anxiety playing tricks on me.

It sounds like the event you attended was a huge source of stress for you, and it's no surprise that your symptoms 'disappeared' once it was over. Our bodies have an amazing ability to respond to stress, and sometimes that means mimicking physical symptoms.

One thing that might help you in the future is to pay attention to your body's physical sensations, and try to connect them to what's going on in your mind. Ask yourself, 'Am I feeling stressed or anxious right now?' or 'Is there something specific that's causing me to feel this way?' It can be really helpful to develop that self-awareness, and it might help you avoid mistaking anxiety for a physical illness. Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this!""","

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
&gt;""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""  
- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship",1650,95,1578450474,"Thank you. The world just seems so overwhelming and awful at the moment. But I know we can get through it, and you can too.",193,Blebonick,,0,,"I just wanted to say thank you for this beautiful post. I'm one of those people who have been obsessively scrolling through news and feeling overwhelmed by the weight of the world. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this feeling.

I love the passage you shared from Bertrand Russell - it's a powerful reminder that we all have the power to make a difference in someone's life, no matter how small it may seem. It's easy to get caught up in the negative feedback loops, but it's posts like yours that remind me to focus on the present moment and the people around me.

One thing that has helped me is setting boundaries with the news and social media. It's okay to take a step back and prioritize self-care. I've also found it helpful to focus on the things I can control, rather than getting bogged down in the things I can't.

Sending you a big hug back, and thank you for being a source of comfort and hope in these uncertain times.","

ivzrch,Anxiety,"Guys, not only did I get a decent job after not working for 4 years but I haven't called or been late yet after my first week!",CatShat23,"Im a terrible flake when it comes to work. My anxiety goes up right before i go in and I end up getting sick and calling off or just not showing up. I'm a terribly unreliable worker.

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was.

Enjoy the animals, sounds like a wonderful job!",48,csb7566381,"""Huge congratulations on making it through your first week of work without any major anxiety setbacks - that's a massive accomplishment, especially given your history with anxiety. It's amazing to see you thriving in an environment that aligns with your passion for animals.

Firstly, acknowledge that it's okay to have those anxious days, and don't be too hard on yourself if you do have a setback. It's all about progress, not perfection. You've already proven to yourself that you can push through and show up, which is a huge confidence booster.

Since you're considering becoming a vet tech, it's great that you're getting a feel for the work environment and building your skills. Remember to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.

You got this, and it's amazing to see you taking control of your life again. Keep pushing forward, and don't let anxiety define you - you're so much more than that.""","

But I'm afraid to text or call him in case he checks his phone while driving and gets into a horrible car accident and dies.

He's come home to me pacing a rut in the living room floor too many times, and in the last couple weeks has started texting me the minute he knows he might not make it out on time.  I feel like a crazy person, but I also appreciate it so so much.",447,Clumsy_Chica,Who say it is?,13,ChuzCuenca,"I feel this so deeply. It's like, one minute you're fine, and the next, your brain is spiraling into worst-case scenarios. I've been there, and it's exhausting. It's like, you know intellectually that it's irrational to assume someone died or hates you just because they haven't messaged you in a day, but try telling that to your anxious brain.

One thing that's helped me is to acknowledge those thoughts, but not give them too much power. When I start to spiral, I take a step back and remind myself that I'm safe, and that this is just my anxiety talking. I also try to focus on the present moment, rather than catastrophizing about the future or past.

It might sound cheesy, but it helps to have a self-compassionate mantra, like ""I'm okay, and I can handle this."" Repeat it to yourself until you start to feel a little better. And hey, if all else fails, take a few deep breaths and go for a walk. Sometimes, a change of scenery can help clear your head. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.","

If the emotions you experience are extreme, I would say this is from the trauma you experienced in your (possibly?) disfuncional family or if you‚Äôve been an abuse survivor. Either way, talking to a counselor may help you make these experiences not as intense.",5,hannah4smiles,"I completely understand what you're going through. It sounds like you're experiencing emotional contagion, where you pick up on others' emotions and internalize them as your own. This is especially common for people who grew up in environments with high conflict, like you mentioned.

Firstly, kudos to you for recognizing this pattern and seeking help. That's already a huge step forward. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed when those around you are angry or frustrated. Your coping mechanisms, like retreating to your room and listening to loud music, might not be the most effective long-term solutions, but they're a start.

Consider reaching out to a therapist who can help you work through your childhood trauma and develop healthier coping strategies. They can also help you determine if you have anxiety and create a plan to manage it. Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with similar issues, and there's support available. You're taking the first steps towards healing, and that's something to be proud of.","

I talked to my friends about my ocd, talking about your anxiety with your loved ones may help in this case, and how i feel triggered and struggle, now they try to be cautious about it.

So, explaining things that triggers you to the people you talk daily may help you too. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",6,iwearanecklace,"I totally get why you'd want that - constant reassurance can be super comforting when anxiety is running high. However, it's probably not feasible (or sustainable) to expect others to constantly tell you they're not mad at you.

Instead, have you considered talking to a therapist about your anxiety? They can help you work through underlying issues and develop coping strategies that don't rely on external validation. Additionally, you might find it helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to not know how others feel about you all the time.

It's also worth exploring anxiety management techniques like mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling. These can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety in the moment. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep taking care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it.","

removes a lot of tension from me. at some point I just fall asleep.",246,mindkingdom,Every night,22,rochesterjones,"""Hey OP, I totally get what you mean. I've been there too, and it's like your brain is working against you. The more you stress about not sleeping, the less likely you are to fall asleep. It's a vicious cycle. 

One thing that helped me was to take a step back and remind myself that it's okay to not sleep perfectly every night. I mean, we've all had those nights where we just can't sleep, and the world doesn't end, right? 

Try to focus on relaxation techniques instead of worrying about sleep. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or even just listening to calming music can help calm your mind and body. And if you do find yourself lying awake, try to reframe it as 'rest time' instead of 'sleep time.' You're still getting some rest, even if you're not sleeping.

Glad to hear that you've found some helpful advice, and I'm sure this post will help others too. Thanks for sharing your experience!""","

lpa08i,Anxiety,Please start exercising,Alexle0,"I‚Äôve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who said they‚Äôre unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you‚Äôre having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",1521,208,1613951549,Proud of you.,202,TheSeasoner91,"I used to play team sports before the pandemic, and I'm a firm believer that that was one of the only things keeping my hidden depression/anxiety at bay.

Exercise is sooo good for you!",121,marveldinosaur99,"Wow, I'm so inspired by your transformation. It's amazing how exercise has helped you manage your anxiety and chronic pain. I can only imagine how tough it must have been to deal with those intense panic attacks and ER visits. Your honesty and vulnerability are truly appreciated, and I'm sure many people here can relate to your struggles.

I love that you emphasized the importance of easing into exercise and not overwhelming yourself. That's such a crucial point, especially for those who are new to working out or have underlying health conditions. It's great that you're prioritizing self-care and listening to your body.

Your story is a testament to the power of exercise and its impact on mental health. I'm sure it's not easy, and there will be setbacks, but it's clear that you're committed to your journey. Thank you for sharing your experience and offering hope to others who may be struggling. Keep pushing forward, and I'm rooting for you!","

It's like anxiety can be this constant shadow, always lurking and stealing away moments that could've been beautiful. It's tough to see the world through a lens of fear and uncertainty, and it's even harder to imagine what life could be like without that weight.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on the small, present moments. When anxiety tries to creep in, I remind myself that I'm safe in this instant. I can breathe, I can feel my feet on the ground, and I can take things one step at a time. It's not always easy, but it's helped me to slowly build up a sense of control and confidence.

Remember that you're not alone in this struggle. There are so many people who are fighting similar battles, and there's hope for a life beyond anxiety. It might not be the same as the one you imagined, but it can still be beautiful and meaningful. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels like the smallest step. You're stronger than you think.","

Surely I am not on my own?",Silent_scroller94,"This has been a strange year for everyone, with huge life changes for all and so much sadness throughout. Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way. 

My relationship with my girlfriend ended almost 2 months ago now, and whilst there have been good days and bad days, I can‚Äôt help shake this feeling of dread and anxiety over normal life returning. It‚Äôs as if life is going to take off full speed ahead and I‚Äôm going to be left in its wake, struggling to adjust to this new single way of life.

There's a lot of truth in what you said ""Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way."" Honestly, a lot of the talk about getting back to normal is probably a product of people not knowing what to say. Lockdown has sucked for most everyone for various reasons and I know I'm guilty of saying I'm looking forward to a return to normal when I really don't mean it - I just don't know what to say!

It's like everyone's expected to be thrilled about going back to 'normal', but that's just not the case for a lot of people. I went through a similar experience during the pandemic, and I have to say, the thought of adjusting to a new reality was overwhelming.

One thing that helped me was to focus on small, manageable steps. Instead of worrying about the big picture, I broke it down into smaller tasks and goals. It sounds simple, but it really helped me regain a sense of control.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to not be okay. You don't have to put on a brave face or pretend like everything's fine if it's not. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist if you need to talk through your feelings. And don't compare yourself to others ‚Äì everyone's journey is different, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, and I'm here to support you.","

Reality is that I get so anxious around other people and so overwhelmed in different situations that my brain literally shuts off. 



It's like when you have stage fright and forget all your lines, even though you had them all memorized the night before. That's my brain 24/7. I forget everything I know, including how to human, and I'm just like uuuuuuuuuhmmmmm.",59,lampshadelixir,"Hey OP, I totally get it. I think a lot of people can relate to feeling like anxiety is being mistaken for a lack of intelligence or capability. The truth is, anxiety can be incredibly debilitating and affect our ability to process information, make decisions, and even communicate effectively.

It's not about being ""stupid"" or ""slow"" - it's about your brain being in overdrive, constantly on high alert, and struggling to keep up. It's like trying to concentrate with a never-ending alarm blaring in your ear.

What I want you to know is that you're not alone, and you're definitely not defined by your anxiety. It's okay to take things at your own pace, to ask for help when you need it, and to prioritize your mental health. Don't be afraid to take a step back, breathe, and remind yourself that you're capable and competent.

Keep being kind to yourself, OP. You got this.","

I used to do the same thing, and it's like I was trying to be some sort of ""acceptable"" version of myself instead of just being genuine. It's exhausting, right?

I think part of the problem is that we're trying to avoid being judged or rejected by others. But the thing is, people are more likely to respond positively to someone who's authentic and themselves. It's refreshing to meet someone who isn't trying to put on a facade.

My advice would be to start small. Try to inject a little bit of your personality into conversations with new people. Use a slang word or two, make a joke that's actually funny to you (not just trying to impress others). And if you do happen to come across as awkward or weird, who cares? It's better to be a little weird and genuine than a boring shell of a person.

Remember, it's okay to be yourself, even if that means being a little quirky. And if people don't respond well to it, they're probably not people you want to be around anyway.","

I always start to speak like a TV presenter for some reason, all bland and weirdly emotionless and, like I said, no personality.

It's like you're riding this emotional rollercoaster, feeling on top of the world one minute, and then suddenly plummeting down into the depths of anxiety and self-doubt. It's exhausting and can be really disheartening.

First of all, just want to say that you're not alone in this feeling. I've been there too, and it's a really common pattern for people who struggle with anxiety and depression.

One thing that's helped me is to try to recognize when I'm in that ""balloon about to be popped"" state, and take steps to ground myself. For me, that means doing some deep breathing exercises, going for a walk, or talking to a trusted friend or family member. It's also helpful to remind myself that these negative thoughts and feelings are temporary, and that they will pass.

It's also worth considering that maybe these ""setbacks"" aren't actually setbacks, but rather just a natural part of the growth process. Maybe you're just getting closer to figuring some stuff out, and that's why it feels so intense. Just a thought. Hang in there, friend.","

The lack of social interaction and nonverbal cues during this quarantine can really play with your mind. I've been there too - constantly overthinking and assuming the worst. It's like, you know it's irrational, but your brain just won't let it go.

Firstly, just want to say that it's okay to feel this way. It's not stupid or weak; it's just a natural response to a really tough situation. Now, I'm not a therapist or anything, but I've found that setting up regular video calls with friends can really help alleviate some of that anxiety. It's not the same as in-person interaction, but it's better than just texting. Plus, it can help you pick up on those nonverbal cues you mentioned.

Also, try to be kind to yourself, okay? Remind yourself that your friends aren't mad at you, and if they were, they'd probably tell you. Try to focus on the positive interactions you do have, and don't be afraid to reach out to them for reassurance. You're not alone in this feeling, and I'm sure your friends will be more than happy to help you feel better.","

First of all, just know that you're not alone in this feeling. It's a common phenomenon, and it's okay to acknowledge those emotions.

One thing that might help is to try to break down tomorrow into smaller, manageable tasks. Sometimes, our brains can make mountains out of molehills, and it's hard to see that until we start to break things down. 

Another thing that might help is to create a relaxing bedtime routine that signals to your brain that it's time to wind down. Whether it's reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches, find what works for you and try to stick to it.

Lastly, remember that tomorrow is just a new day ‚Äì it's not a definition of your worth or a prediction of your success. Take things one step at a time, and know that you can face whatever comes your way.","

It's like, you're just sitting there, waiting for someone to respond, and the longer you wait, the more your mind starts racing with all these negative thoughts.

One thing that's helped me is to try to shift my perspective. Instead of assuming everyone's ignoring me or thinks I'm stupid, I tell myself that people are just busy with their own lives. They might not have seen the message, or they might be waiting for someone else to respond, or they might just be having a bad day. There are so many reasons why someone might not respond right away, and 99% of the time it has nothing to do with you or what you said.

Also, try to set a timer for like 30 minutes or an hour and then check the chat again. This helps me avoid obsessively checking my phone and getting more anxious. And if you're still feeling anxious, try talking to a friend or family member about it. Sometimes just sharing your feelings with someone who cares about you can help put things into perspective.","

Also, try setting aside some time each day for self-care and doing something that brings you joy. It can be as simple as taking a walk or reading a book. The goal is to focus on the present moment and let go of some of that anxiety.

Anxiety can be a major brain fog inducer, making it hard to think clearly and process thoughts before acting or speaking. It's like your brain is constantly racing and you're trying to catch up. I've been there too, and the worst part is the self-criticism that comes after - ""Why did I say that?!"" or ""What was I thinking?!"" 

Here's the thing: your anxiety doesn't define your intelligence or worth as a person. It's just a mental health condition that's temporarily hijacking your brain. Try to be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion when you make mistakes. Remind yourself that it's okay to pause and take a moment before responding or acting. Take a few deep breaths, step away from the situation if needed, and try to reframe your thoughts.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people with anxiety struggle with similar feelings of self-doubt and embarrassment. But you are capable of managing your anxiety and learning to navigate these situations with more ease. Keep working on your mental health, and try to focus on progress, not perfection.","

Here's the thing: it's not you, it's your anxiety. And it's not something to be ashamed of. If you feel comfortable, you could try explaining to your boss or colleagues that you're still getting used to the new environment and sometimes need a minute to process information. They might be more understanding than you think.

Also, don't worry about not catching the joke ‚Äì it's not a reflection of your intelligence. Remember, anxiety can affect anyone, regardless of their cognitive abilities. You're doing great just by showing up and putting in the effort. Keep pushing through, and don't let those laughs get to you. You got this!","

POST TITLE: Anyone else hate it when people think you‚Äôre dumb when it‚Äôs actually anxiety?

POST BODY:  For instance, I have a new job and it‚Äôs in construction. There a lot of new people there that I don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs a lot of new situations, it‚Äôs pretty stressful and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing half the time because I‚Äôm an apprentice.

When I‚Äôm in these situations it‚Äôs like my brain doesn‚Äôt function, it doesn‚Äôt think logically at all because it‚Äôs stressful. It just doesn‚Äôt work.

My boss was telling me very important information the other day and added a joke in the middle of it, although because I knew I had to listen and take the information in, I didn‚Äôt catch the joke. Because I didn‚Äôt catch it there was a few people who were laughing at me not getting it, thinking I was thick. 

Anyone else feel like this?

Like I put it off till it's over due even if it is something so simple.,141,ShipSam,"I totally get it, and I'm sure you're not alone. I've been there too, especially when it comes to responsibilities and commitments. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks and interactions piling up.

Firstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. You're not being lazy or incapable; you're just being honest about your limits. One strategy that might help is breaking down each task into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I need to schedule a meeting,"" try ""I need to respond to this email and propose a few dates."" Focus on one step at a time.

Another thing that might help is setting aside specific times for responding to emails, texts, and calls. This can help you feel more in control and allow you to tackle each task without feeling overwhelmed. Remember, it's okay to take your time and not respond immediately. Your friends and colleagues will likely understand.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. You're about to start law school, and it's normal to feel anxious about the added responsibilities. Take care of yourself, and remember that you can always ask for help if you need it.","

It's like, how do you separate the real gut feeling from the anxiety-induced 'oh no, the sky is falling' feeling? I've struggled with this too.

One thing that's helped me is to try to tune in to the physical sensations in my body when I'm getting a gut feeling. For me, it's usually a tightness in my stomach or a lump in my throat. When I'm anxious, my body feels more tense and jittery all over. So, I try to pay attention to whether the sensation is localized or if it's just my whole body freaking out.

It's not a foolproof method, but it's helped me to distinguish between the two. I also try to take a step back, breathe, and ask myself if there's any actual evidence to support my gut feeling. It's not about ignoring your anxiety, but about learning to trust your body's signals again. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to take your time figuring it out.","

I think it's awesome that you're aware of your own needs and boundaries, and you're taking care of yourself by wearing a mask. It's not weird at all - in fact, it's really self-aware. If it helps calm your anxiety, that's all that matters.

If you don't mind me asking, have you explored other anxiety-reducing strategies that you find helpful? I've found that combining mask-wearing with other techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, can really help in overwhelming situations.","

lfmrtn,Anxiety,Anybody else find it suspicious when they‚Äôre NOT anxious,[deleted],My mind instantly goes to all the worst possible scenarios. It‚Äôs like an addiction to overthink and be anxious. Feels odd to feel calm... anyone else?,1527,131,1612820788,I always think if I let myself be calm something bad will happen.,246,MeetStrong,"When I was recovering from depression and anxiety (which I struggled with for the first 25 years of my life) I felt a weird sort of void when I was feeling calm and peaceful. I can go back and look at journal entries from that time and often noted a feeling of ""emptiness"" or ""numbness"" and that I felt like something was ""missing."" -- since that time I have realized how to let go of ideas about how I ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" feel.   


I have found a daily meditation practice and paleo (low carb/whole foods) diet has virtually eliminated this ""empty"" feeling. There is no such thing as empty, there is just calm, and it's okay to be calm. I notice it. I actively try to quiet my mind and explore the calmness. To turn off the voice in my head (release it, let it go), for at least a few minutes at a time. And when I do this (usually through meditation) I often feel like I have had a power nap. I have literally felt a sensation like cool water on my brain, right behind my eyes. It's awesome.",5,Adoniram1733,"I completely get what you're saying. I've been there too, where feeling calm can actually make me anxious because it's so unfamiliar. It's like my brain is waiting for the other shoe to drop, and I'm just anticipating the next thing to go wrong.

I think it's great that you're recognizing this pattern in yourself, though. That's the first step to changing it. One thing that's helped me is to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in all the what-ifs. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can be really helpful for this.

It might also be worth exploring why you feel like you need to be anxious. Is it a way of preparing for potential dangers, or is it more of a self-protective mechanism? Understanding the underlying motivations behind your anxiety can help you address the root cause and work towards feeling more calm and centered.

Remember, it's okay to feel calm and relaxed ‚Äì it's not a sign that something is wrong. You deserve to feel peaceful, and it's worth working towards that.","

It's like our brains have a highlight reel of all the cringe-worthy moments from our past and they love to play it on repeat. I've been there too, wishing I could take back something I said or did years ago. 

Here's the thing: our brains are wired to focus on the negative, but that doesn't mean we have to let it define us. It might help to reframe those memories and remind yourself that you were just a kid/teenager doing the best you could with the resources you had at the time. You've grown so much since then, and it's okay to acknowledge that.

It's great that you're acknowledging this pattern and seeking support. Remember that you're not alone, and it's amazing that you're creating a space for others to share their experiences too. Keep in mind that those people from your past likely don't even remember those moments, and if they do, they're probably not judging you as harshly as you're judging yourself. Be kind to yourself, and try to practice some self-compassion. You got this.","

ms6sy6,Anxiety,My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.,weeblybeebly,"It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",1552,96,1618590368,Wow that is a game changer.

Discomfort is a big issue with a good chunk of my anxiety. Thank you for sharing!! I have some thinking to do.,199,secretsmakeX,"When you encounter enemies in a video game it means you're going the right way

Edit: Thinking this has helped me work my way through a lot of uncomfortable situations and relationships. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs resonated with so many people here. Also I stole this from someone on Reddit, I can‚Äôt remember the thread but I‚Äôve been saying this to myself for years.",187,thugnificent856,"""I totally get it, and I'm so glad you shared this game-changing insight from your therapist. It's easy to get stuck in a cycle of avoidance when discomfort is the primary motivator. But reframing discomfort as a necessary step towards growth is incredibly powerful. It's amazing how a simple shift in perspective can make all the difference.

One thing that resonated with me is the idea that we need to give ourselves room to fail. It's so easy to get caught up in the fear of not doing things 'perfectly,' but the truth is, failure is often where the real growth happens. By embracing discomfort and allowing ourselves to take risks, we can develop a sense of resilience and confidence that's hard to find otherwise.

Thanks for sharing your story and inspiring others to take the leap. Remember, it's okay to take it one small step at a time ‚Äì and celebrate those tiny victories along the way!""","

czqtqt,Anxiety,Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?,QueenFrankie420,"I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. My stomach will hurt and occasionally I'll get heartburn. Only when I'm highly anxious.

I just wondered if anyone else gets this and can't think of anywhere I'd be more comfortable asking....

Edit - wow, this blew up. I had no idea this was such a common thing!",1424,224,1567631317,100% yes. It's awful. I'm now at the point where if I get a stomach ache for any reason I'm immediately anxious because I'm connecting the fact that anxiety makes me sick. It's a vicious cycle.,249,maggiemoocorgipoo,"Yes! 

Here is a story of me and my anxiety last summer.

I was going through a really stressful time. My sleep was shit and I was sad all the time. I started noticing at some point that my stomach had started hurting all the time. I would get weird different types of stomach pains in different areas of my stomach. I would have diarrhea and nausea literally every morning.

I ended up going to the doctor. A lot. I visited time and time again, always complaining about my stomach. They would run blood tests, take samples of my poop and eventually they even took an ultrasound of my stomach. I was in constant pain all the time. Yet nothing was wrong. 

I even got one of those things with a camera shoved down my throat to check my stomach. Yet again, nothing wrong. I never found any relief in any of the doctors telling me I was ok.

I wasnt ok! I was feeling like shit. I went to the gas station one day to fill up, and there was a restaurant attached, so I decided to order a warm meal. I took one bite and suddenly it felt like my heart was about to burst. I ran to the bathroom and it felt like I couldnt breathe. 

I was having my first panic attack. I didnt know this at the time. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I drove home to see my mother. She was watering some plants and I just told her everything and how scared I was.

She looked at me and said what im experiencing is completely normal. She said everybody goes through anxiety at some part of their life. She then asked me if I was hungry. I said yeah sure.

Just half an hour ago I was sitting in a gas station bathroom crying and feeling like shit, but now I was eating normally. Actually I was eating like a madman lol.

Slowly, but surely I started to understand It was my anxiety causing all this. 

I got even more confirmation the next week when I went to my sisters and her husband. We went fishing and had a couple of beers afterwards. Didnt know I was dealing with anxiety at the time, bad idea to drink alcohol.

We all went to bed and I just couldnt sleep. My heart was beating out of my chest! It felt like my chest was going to explode. I called a taxi and went to the hospital. I complained about shortness of breath and my heart beating like crazy. Got everything checked up and the nurses said there is nothing wrong with me. I chatted with them for a while and one of them asked if I had ever experienced panic attacks. 

At that point I truly started realizing what I was dealing with. OP if you read all the way here, just know that what is happening is normal and part of the process. The pain you feel is real! The tools to combat, however, might be in your mind! 

A year later I‚Äôm still struggling with anxiety but everything regarding gastrointestinal issues I am able to process relatively well.",45,perae,"I'm so glad you asked this question. I can totally relate to what you're going through. Anxiety and gastrointestinal issues are closely linked, and it's more common than you think. The gut and the brain are connected through the gut-brain axis, which means that stress and anxiety can affect digestive health.

When I'm feeling anxious, I try to focus on deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation to calm my body down. I also make sure to stay hydrated and avoid trigger foods that can exacerbate the issue. Another thing that's helped me is practicing mindfulness and meditation to manage my anxiety levels.

Remember, you're not alone in this. It's great that you're acknowledging the connection between your anxiety and gut issues, and that's the first step to managing it. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional if your symptoms persist or worsen. You got this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","

One thing that might help is to recognize that this is a pattern in your thinking, and to try to catch yourself when you're doing it. When you finally solve that one issue, take some time to celebrate and acknowledge your success. Don't immediately jump to the next problem ‚Äì take a moment to breathe and appreciate the progress you've made.

It's also worth considering that maybe the goal shouldn't be to eliminate all barriers, but to learn to be more present and at peace in the midst of chaos. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can really help with this. And hey, just knowing you're not alone in this struggle might make it a little more manageable.

High-functioning anxiety can be a real challenge, especially when the people around us don't quite grasp what we're going through. It's not just 'worrying' ‚Äì it's a full-body experience that can be overwhelming and debilitating.

One thing that might help is to try to explain it to others in a way that's relatable. For example, you could compare it to a physical response like a panic attack, but instead of being triggered by a specific event, it's triggered by your own thoughts and emotions. This way, people can start to understand that it's not just something you can 'snap out of.'

It's also important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. There are so many of us out there who are fighting similar battles, and just knowing that can be a huge source of comfort. Keep talking about it, keep sharing your experiences, and know that you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of.

a31oct,Anxiety,Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?,Beanini666,"I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.

I've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to ""act"" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.

It's like your brain is constantly running on overdrive, making it hard to focus, think clearly, or even care about things that used to bring you joy. I've been there too, and it's exhausting.

Firstly, please know that your anxiety hasn't made you less intelligent. It's just that your brain is preoccupied with, well, anxiety. It's like having a constant background noise that's hard to tune out.

One thing that's helped me is mindfulness and self-compassion. When I catch myself overthinking or obsessing, I try to acknowledge those thoughts and gently bring my focus back to the present moment. It's not about suppressing your thoughts, but about learning to coexist with them.

Also, don't underestimate the power of small wins. Break down tasks into tiny, manageable chunks, and celebrate each tiny victory. It's amazing how those small wins can build momentum and confidence.

Lastly, remember that you're not alone in this. Your ""brain dumping"" post has already resonated with so many people here. Keep sharing, and know that we're all in this together.","

Sometimes I actually have and idk why this happens? In my brain I‚Äôm like ‚Äúok I‚Äôm good nothing bad is here‚Äù but my body just gets the WORST nausea I‚Äôve ever experienced. Does this happen to anyone else? And how can I fix it?,1431,208,1590768343,"Yes.  At this point, I often feel the nausea before the emotions of anxiety.

Now if I get a stomach ache, I ask myself, what am I nervous about?",226,Hannajomac,"I totally get it. I've been there too, and it's honestly one of the most frustrating things about anxiety - your brain is like, ""Chill, everything's fine,"" but your body is all, ""NOPE, WE'RE PANICKING.""

For me, it's always been about finding ways to calm my body down when it starts to react like that. Deep breathing exercises have been a lifesaver - try inhaling for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling for four. It sounds simple, but it can really help slow down your heart rate and calm your stomach.

Another thing that's helped me is paying attention to my physical sensations and trying to release tension as it builds up. So, if I start to feel my shoulders tensing or my stomach churning, I take a moment to consciously relax those muscles. It's not always easy, but it's helped me avoid some of those nasty anxiety-induced nausea episodes.

You're not alone in this, and it's not something you need to ""fix"" - it's just your body's way of reacting to stress. But with some practice and patience, you can learn to manage it. Hang in there!","

The gut-brain connection is real, and when we're feeling anxious, our bodies can respond in some pretty uncomfortable ways.

One thing that's helped me is practicing relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. When I start to feel anxious, I try to take a few minutes to calm down and focus on my breath. It's not always easy, but it can help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, including stomach upset.

Also, have you considered talking to a therapist or doctor about your anxiety? They can help you develop coping strategies and work through underlying issues that might be contributing to your anxiety. And if you're experiencing persistent or severe stomach issues, it's always a good idea to get checked out by a medical professional to rule out any underlying conditions.

Hang in there, OP. You're not alone in this, and there are people and resources available to support you.""","

It can be overwhelming to feel like you're constantly fighting your own mind, while it seems like others get to live life without that weight. I've been there too, and it's frustrating.

Here's the thing: everyone has their own struggles, even if they don't show it. It's easy to assume that others have it easier, but the truth is, we all have our own battles to fight. Some people might be dealing with anxiety, depression, or trauma, just like you. Others might be struggling with relationships, finances, or health issues.

It's not about comparing yourself to others, but about finding ways to manage your own worries and thoughts. Have you tried mindfulness, meditation, or journaling? These can help calm your mind and reduce rumination. It's also important to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support. You don't have to face this alone.

ej29di,Anxiety,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,courtneat,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.",1362,274,1577990768,"Nope, not just you.  Grind away until you die, hope that you don't get sick.",281,TheFakeZzig,"Nope, not just you.  Grind away until you die, hope that you don't get sick.",281,TheFakeZzig,"I totally get where you're coming from, and I'm glad you're not feeling alone in this anymore. It's not just you; many people struggle with the idea of working 40+ hours a week for decades. I'd say it's pretty normal to feel suffocated by the monotony and pressure.

One thing to consider is that our current societal expectations around work and retirement are pretty outdated. The idea of working non-stop until 65 is no longer realistic for many people. Maybe it's time to redefine what success and fulfillment mean to you. 

Explore alternative options, like part-time work, freelancing, or entrepreneurship. These paths can offer more flexibility and autonomy, allowing you to prioritize what truly matters to you. Also, don't underestimate the power of small, incremental changes. Start by carving out dedicated time for hobbies, self-care, and travel (even if it's just a weekend getaway). These tiny wins can add up and give you a sense of control over your life.

Remember, you're not lazy; you're just craving a more balanced, meaningful life. And that's a perfectly valid desire. Keep questioning the status quo and seeking out solutions that work for you.","

It's crazy how easily our bodies can tense up when we're stressed or anxious, isn't it? I've found that taking a few deep breaths and actively relaxing my muscles can make a huge difference in how I feel. Try it with me - unclench those teeth, roll those shoulders, and breathe in slowly through your nose, out through your mouth. It's a small thing, but it can be a powerful way to calm your nervous system and remind yourself that you're safe.

To the OP, thank you for sharing this reminder with us. It's a beautiful act of kindness, and it's a great reminder that we're all in this together. If anyone needs to talk or just needs someone to listen, I'm here for you.""","

Wish I could help you but I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with it myself. We'll get there eventually.,74,Klassified94,"I totally feel you, OP. It's like you're riding this rollercoaster of emotions and can't seem to find a stable middle ground. First off, let me tell you that you're not alone in this struggle. So many people with anxiety experience this exact pattern, and it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities.

One thing that might help is to focus on maintaining a consistent routine, even when you're feeling great. This can help regulate your emotions and make the crash less severe. Also, try to identify any triggers that might be contributing to your anxiety spikes. Are there certain situations, people, or thoughts that tend to set you off?

Lastly, remember that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to take a step back, rest, and recharge when you're feeling overwhelmed. You're not a waste of oxygen ‚Äì you're a human being who's struggling, and that's something to be acknowledged and respected. Keep in mind that it might be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional for more personalized guidance and support. Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone.","

jroy1r,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,cry-b4by,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)",1526,101,1605028409,"I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I‚Äôm no sigmund freud but for me it‚Äôs definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I‚Äôm assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It‚Äôs only going to help. Best wishes and good luck!",180,adolescentd,Do you have ADHD? I have always been anxious and depressed but I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. The psych said my strong aversion to loud noises is from that.,1,xanaxhelps,"Hey there, welcome to the community. I totally get why you'd feel anxious when hearing yelling, even if it's not directed at you. It's like your body is on high alert, anticipating something bad might happen.

I think it's great that you're already taking steps to address your mental health by scheduling a therapist intake. Definitely bring this up with them - it's a valuable insight into how you respond to stressors. They can help you explore the underlying reasons for your reaction and work on coping strategies.

One possible explanation is that your brain is associating yelling with a potential threat, triggering a fight-or-flight response. This can be especially true if you're someone who values peace and quiet, like you mentioned being a shy kid.

You're not alone in this, by the way. Many people experience anxiety in response to loud noises or conflict, even if it's not directly related to them. So, don't worry, you're not weird or overreacting. Just take things at your own pace, and remember that you're taking steps towards understanding and managing your anxiety.","

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I want you to know that you're not alone in this experience. It's actually a pretty common physical symptom of anxiety, often referred to as a 'stress response' or 'fight or flight' reaction. Your body is basically going into overdrive, releasing stress hormones like adrenaline, which can cause that cold, tingling sensation.

One thing that might help is taking a few deep breaths and trying to focus on the physical sensation in your body. Sometimes, acknowledging and accepting it can help calm it down a bit. Also, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your social anxiety - they can help you develop coping strategies and work through some of the underlying issues. You got this, and you're not alone.""","

Anxiety can be a real appetite-killer, but at the same time, it's like your body is screaming for food. It's like this internal tug-of-war, and it can be super frustrating.

First of all, kudos to you for managing to get some smoothies down - that's a great start. Sometimes, when we're feeling anxious, our bodies can be super sensitive to textures and tastes, so smoothies can be a great way to get some nutrients in.

If you're feeling up to it, you might want to try some small, gentle bites of food - like crackers or toast - to see if you can tolerate them. Sometimes, taking small steps can help your body (and mind) adjust to eating again. Also, don't worry too much about eating ""proper"" meals right now - just focus on getting something in your system.

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and don't beat yourself up if you can't eat a full meal right away. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Hang in there, and take care of yourself.","

hpaekj,Anxiety,Does anybody else find the sound of rain soothing?,ChampagneSupernovae,"When it rains (as it is doing so now), I always love to turn off my lights and lie in bed listening to it hit the roof or pavement outside. I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

Kinda breaks my heart... but at least I have the memories. And the falling rain reminds me of those wonderful memories.

It's beautiful that you hold those memories dear, and it's clear that they're an important part of who you are. Even though the camp isn't the same anymore, it's wonderful that you can still tap into those feelings of peace and relaxation whenever it rains.

If you don't mind me suggesting, maybe try to recreate some of that camp magic in your current life? Whether it's setting up a cozy reading nook with a rain soundtrack or taking a quiet walk in the woods, see if you can find ways to recapture some of that sense of calm and connection to nature. It might not be the same as the camp, but it could help you hold onto that feeling of serenity.","

It's like our brains are wired to jump straight to the worst-case scenario, isn't it? I've had similar experiences with weird noises or sensations, and my mind immediately goes into 'catastrophe mode.' It's exhausting.

But here's the thing: recognizing this pattern is actually a huge step forward. It means you're becoming more aware of your thought patterns and can start to challenge them. Next time you catch yourself thinking ""stroke"" instead of ""toast,"" try to pause and say to yourself, ""wait a minute, what's the evidence for this?"" or ""is there a more rational explanation?"" It might sound silly, but it can really help to rewire your brain.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be a real pain, but it's clear from all the comments that you're not the only one who's experienced this. Thanks for sharing your 'toilet thought' (love that phrase, btw!) ‚Äì it's nice to know we're all in this together","

And then the insomnia lol... =/,173,CidCrisis,"I totally get it, OP. I used to dread going back to work after vacations or long weekends too. It's like my brain was saying, ""Wait, I was just relaxing on a beach/reading a book/enjoying quality time with loved ones... now I have to go back to this stressful job?"" 

One thing that helped me was to gradually ease back into work mode the day before I returned. I'd start by checking my emails, responding to any urgent ones, and planning out my tasks for the next day. This helped me feel more in control and prepared. I also made sure to take breaks throughout the day and prioritize self-care, whether that's a walk during lunch or a meditation session during my morning commute.

Remember, it's normal to feel anxious about going back to work, especially after a break. But you got through it before, and you can do it again. Take it one step at a time, prioritize your well-being, and remind yourself that you're not alone. Hang in there, and thank you for sharing your experience ‚Äì it's nice to know I'm not the only one who feels this way!","

I totally get why this might seem like a small thing to others, but to you, it's a huge deal, and that's what matters. 

It takes a lot of courage to break out of our comfort zones and do things on our own, especially when it comes to things like doctor's appointments. But the fact that you did it shows that you're capable of so much more than you thought.

Remember that every small victory adds up, and this is just the beginning. You got this far, and you can keep pushing forward. Don't be too hard on yourself if you do need help or support sometimes, though - it's okay to ask for it. Just know that you're strong enough to do things on your own when you need to, and that's an incredible feeling.

Keep celebrating these tiny wins - they're what make life worth living.""","

Anxiety poops are the WORST. It's like your body is trying to add insult to injury, right? I've been there too, and it's super frustrating.

First, just want to say that you're not alone in this. The gut-brain connection is a real thing, and it's actually pretty well-studied. When we're stressed, our body releases all these hormones that can mess with our digestion. It's like our gut is trying to 'flee' from the stress too.

One thing that's helped me is practicing relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, when I feel the anxiety creeping in. It's not a magic cure, but it can help calm your gut (and your mind) a bit.

Also, consider keeping some emergency supplies in your bag, like wipes, hand sanitizer, and some spare underwear (just in case). It's not the most glamorous thing, but it can help you feel a bit more prepared and in control.

Hang in there, friend. You're not alone in this, and it's not a reflection of your worth. Sending you calm vibes""","

I've been there too, where the anticipation of an event is way more overwhelming than the actual event itself. It's like your brain is trying to protect you from potential discomfort, but in reality, it's just holding you back.

One thing that's helped me is breaking down the process into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of thinking ""I have to go to this whole event,"" try focusing on ""I just need to get out of bed and put on some clothes."" Then, ""I just need to grab my keys and head out the door."" It sounds silly, but it can make a big difference.

Also, remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious, and that it doesn't mean you're not capable of handling the situation. You've enjoyed these events in the past, so try to tap into that positive experience. Take some deep breaths, put on your favorite music, and just take it one step at a time. You got this, and it's worth pushing through the anxiety.","

It's like, you're having an amazing time with friends, and then suddenly your brain decides to turn on you and you're convinced that everyone secretly hates you. It's exhausting.

First of all, know that you're not alone in this. So many people with anxiety experience this exact same thing. It's like our brains are wired to look for potential threats, even when there aren't any.

One thing that might help is to challenge those negative thoughts when they come up. Like, ask yourself if there's any actual evidence that your friends don't like you. Usually, the answer is no. Also, try to focus on the present moment and the things that are going well, rather than getting caught up in hypotheticals.

Lastly, just remember that it's okay to have a bad thought or two (or ten). It doesn't mean that you're broken or that you need 'brain surgery' (although I do feel you on that one). You're just doing the best you can with the tools you have, and that's something to be proud of.""","

It might also be worth trying some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. These can help calm your nerves and reduce the anxiety that's making you feel like you need to pee.

I want to acknowledge how brave it is to share your struggles with imposter syndrome and feeling like you have something to prove. It's amazing that you're recognizing the disparity between how others see you and how you actually feel.

If I may offer a suggestion, have you considered trying to reframe your anxiety as a signal rather than an enemy? When you start to feel that 'zero gravity rib cage crushing feeling,' try to acknowledge it as a sign that you need to take a step back and prioritize self-care. Remember that it's okay to take a break and seek help when you need it - and that includes taking medication like Ativan to cope.

Constant physical and mental exhaustion,276,nursejk16,"This, and I hate it.",52,strdrrngr,"I totally get it - the constant fatigue and anxiety can be a vicious cycle. I've been there too, and it's incredibly frustrating when you feel like you've done everything right (getting enough rest, eating well, etc.) but still can't shake off the exhaustion.

From what you've shared, it's definitely possible that anxiety is a significant contributor to your fatigue. When our brains are constantly on high alert, it can be draining - both physically and mentally. It's like your body is constantly ""on edge,"" waiting for the next perceived threat.

One thing that might help is to explore some anxiety-reducing strategies, like mindfulness, deep breathing, or meditation. These can help calm your nervous system and reduce those anxious thoughts. Additionally, consider talking to a therapist who can help you work through your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with anxiety and fatigue, and it's not a sign of weakness. You're taking the first step by acknowledging your struggles and seeking help - that takes a lot of courage.","

When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake.

One thing that helped me was to focus on what I can control ‚Äì my own driving. Instead of worrying about other people's mistakes or potential hazards, I try to stay present and focused on the road. It also helps to remind myself that I'm a capable and safe driver.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, you might want to consider talking to a therapist or a driving instructor who can help you work through your anxiety. They can also provide you with some practical tips and strategies to make driving feel less stressful.

Lastly, it's okay to take breaks and step away from driving if you're feeling anxious. Your safety and well-being are the most important things, and it's better to prioritize those than to push through and risk feeling more anxious or even having an accident. You're not alone in this, and there's support available.","

POST TITLE: Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?

POST BODY: Seriously, I don‚Äôt understand how people aren‚Äôt absolutely terrified of driving. You‚Äôre inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don‚Äôt hit someone. I hate when people tailgate me when I‚Äôm at the speed limit or slightly above. When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake. There are so many variables and the risks are so high. How people enjoy it is beyond me.

Anyone else feel like this?

anwqai,Anxiety,"Anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?",DerpFalcon12,"Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. 

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well",1445,130,1549493472,"Yeah it‚Äôs so weird. Whenever I have that confidence boost I wonder how I couldn‚Äôt have it. How easy it feels to be confident.

Then after a day I‚Äôm on the other side and I can‚Äôt imagine feeling confident. ",308,GriddleMyFiddle,"This is one of the reasons why Anxiety is classified as a disorder. Those of us with anxiety and other things like depression and panic ect... it is caused by the inability for our brains to regulate chemical processes. So with anxiety and panic, our Amygdala is pretty fucked up. The amygdala is incharge of regulating norepinephrine ( the stress signal), dopamine, serotonin, Adrenalin and cortisol. When the Amygdala cant regulate properly it either, sends to much or not enough of these chemicals, and it never happens like clock work. One day we will get too much, then the next fived days not enough and the next 4 days not enough and the next too much ect... its not a perfect pattern.. if it was... we would probably be better able to adapt to our ""regular"" cycles. 

&amp;#x200B;

So With us.. we have to remember and learn about how our unique, malfunctioning brain works.. If you feel on top of the world for a day, after a long haul of feeling like shit, remember that you will experience a crash eventually, But Dont pout about it, its just biology, our brains and bodies are not used to the amount of dopamine and serotonin production that the amygdala is giving off that day or week that we feel on top of the world, This will result in a crash, where we feel tired,and it will probably go back to producing to much cortisol, which is what happens when normal people are tired. Tired people are stressed and depressed. It is an annoying vicious cycle, i do not wish upon anyone, but what really helped me was being able to listen and know my body... 

On those days that you feel high in the sky, observe what is happening, and observe that fact that you are not used to it, so you will crash, and you must enjoy the ride. Be prepared for the next days to come.

It sucks, but it is not a hopeless cause. If you really try, you can help calm the shit out of your own brain. I have done it. I will never be completely cured of  depression or anxiety, Everyone feels anxious  and depressed at times because this is natural, what you want to cure is the anxiety or depression you feel when you cannot think of a reason why. Once you have done that, You can move onto curing more specific things like social anxiety, chronic stress, activities or memories that give you depression or anxiety.

I wont put all of the specifics, because if you want to help yourself you are going to look up each of these things.  ( I am putting the ones that I have tried that worked at the top) Things to help you heal your amygdala are:

atleast 15- 20 minuets of sunlight per day

Meditate and stretch. ( yoga or not stretch your body) 

Diet change ( their are specific foods that do not help and can even cause depression and stress, its not the food specifically that causes it, it is what that food does to the body which domino effects to your brain. You basically have a brain in your stomach, many people call the stomach ""the second brain"" when in fact it should be the first brain, your stomach has a larger neural network then the brains in our head do, so when you are choosing food to eat, remember that what you feed your belly, you are feeding to your brain.)

Good nights sleep

10 min nap in the middle of the day

Water- Drink it, Swim, take baths, showers, put your feet in it or watch it. Water is therapeutic.

Switching up your routine, ( or getting a routine, if you are like me that was not a thing before)

Get a hobby.

Exercise ( I hate working out, but what helped me was at that moment which I started to feel like shit, panic, anxious, depressed, I would walk it out, Even run up and down the stairs, when we are active our brains produce special chemicals that sort of override the stress hormones and lack of serotonin and dopamine) 

Getting a pet and\\or having plants in your house ( again if you like me and have trouble keeping plant alive, choose succulents. Plants bring good chi, especially if you dont go outside very much to be around plants, having them in the place where you are most often helps you ).

The best thing I ever did for myself  to heal Panic disorder and anxiety, that I never thought of until I started Cognitive behavioral Therapy ( on my own, no money required)  was when I learned that I need to insert my self into settings and situations that I would otherwise not, As in do shit that gives me anxiety. For example I am scared to death of heights, So I went free climbing with my boyfriend in a canyon, yes I did cry on the way down, and no I did not look down when I got to the top of the maybe 50 feet we climbed, but there was this weird thing that happened, where I felt like I could do that again, and thinking about what I did didnt bring me anxiety&gt; I repeatedly did this. I have social anxiety, and I inserted my self into social situations, slowly at first, but last weekend I stayed out of my room for an entire party my roomates had, there was NO retreating. I took a job in a city 20 mins away from house, which I have to drive through a snowy canyon to get too... Do I have driving anxiety anymore? Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my last drug I will prescribe you.

Change. Change up your life, like your day to day routine, change stuff. There was a study they did with school kids that showed when the kids change which side of the classroom they sit in every day it helps them learn better, Basically not changing where you sit, creates a sort of comfort and familiarity, lessening attention. When we change up our lives often, we crawl out of the comfort zone, things that were unfamiliar and anxiety ridden before, become more friendly to us. When we change things, we create more energy, we are tired less often, and less fatigue means less depression, less stress, less anxiety. 

Change your life, and you will really change your life. 

Take it slow, remember that you are human and humans are a mystery to this world. We are powerful machines, and Mind over Matter does exist. Do not fall into this preconceived notion that you have a problem that can only be fixed by medications and doctors.. most of the time, that is not true. Take the steps to help your self first, and if you really just cannot do it, then spend the money on a therapist.. But in all honesty, we are our own best therapists. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 ",61,s0nder369thOughts,"I totally get what you're going through, and I'm glad you reached out for help. It sounds like you're experiencing some intense mood swings, and I can imagine how disorienting and frustrating that must be.

First of all, kudos to you for taking that first step and talking to the counseling center at your university. That takes a lot of courage, and it's awesome that you're taking proactive steps to understand what's going on.

I'm not a mental health expert, but it's possible that the crash after the confidence boost is partly due to the pressure to maintain that high level of confidence. It's like you're setting yourself up for a fall, you know? Maybe try to focus on finding a more balanced, sustainable sense of self-worth that's not tied to those extreme highs.

Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep taking care of yourself and seeking out resources ‚Äì you got this!","

ccgt2q,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like their brain just literally searches for any reason to worry?,Anti5ive,"I swear if the source of my anxiety gets resolved, I just immediately find something else to worry about.

Then it's anywhere from a few minutes to a few days before my brain finds a new worry/new angle on the old worry and off we go again :(",174,ikarka,"I totally feel you on this. It's like our brains have a 'worry mode' that's always on, and if there's no clear reason to worry, we'll just scan our surroundings until we find something, anything, to latch onto.

I think this is actually a common anxiety mechanism, where our brains try to prepare us for potential threats by constantly scanning for risks. The problem is, it can get stuck in overdrive.

One strategy that's helped me is to practice mindfulness and challenge those pesky thoughts when they arise. Ask yourself if the thing you're worrying about is actually a real, immediate threat, or if it's just hypothetical. Try to reframe your thoughts in a more realistic, positive light.

Also, it might be helpful to focus on the present moment and let go of worries about the future or past. Mindfulness exercises, deep breathing, or even just taking a walk can help calm your mind and break the worry cycle.

Remember, you're not alone in this! Many people struggle with anxiety, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Keep working on it, and know that it's possible to find some peace amidst the worries.","

hd78e8,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù their anxiety disorder?,[deleted],"As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i‚Äôve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues. My parents have done A LOT for me over the years and I am grateful for that. I just have some internal rage built up.",1400,174,1592747394,"I see what you‚Äôre saying. I have OCD and depression with the lovey bonus of panic attacks. There‚Äôs a lot of mental health history, on both sides of my family, and I tend to think that‚Äôs a large portion of my issues.

The other is absolutely how I was raised. My parents are great, but family dynamics and personalities clash and there was a lot of passive aggression, critique, pressure and too much responsibility put on me at a young age. There was also a lot of flux and change in my life (military family.) So while I don‚Äôt necessarily get angry at them, I can trace certain feelings or triggers I have back to consistent episodes in my family. And it annoys me and sometimes I resent that I was put in that situation.",155,WadsworthInTheHall,"I see what you‚Äôre saying. I have OCD and depression with the lovey bonus of panic attacks.

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the impact our parents can have on our mental health, especially when it's not always easy to see. I've been in similar shoes, and it's like, you're grateful for the good things they've done, but at the same time, you're like, ""Wait, why did they have to do it this way?""

First off, let me just say that your feelings are valid. It's normal to feel angry or resentful when you feel like your parents' actions (or lack thereof) have contributed to your struggles. But here's the thing: holding onto that anger might not be the most helpful thing for you in the long run.

What's helped me is trying to see things from a more nuanced perspective. My parents did the best they could with what they had, but that doesn't mean I have to internalize the negative messages they sent me. I'm trying to rewire my thinking, focus on self-compassion, and work on building my own sense of self-worth.

It's a process, and it's not easy, but it's worth it. You're already taking a huge step by acknowledging your feelings and taking responsibility for your own growth. Keep pushing forward, and remember that you're not alone in this.","

I think it's so important to remember that your anxiety is valid, no matter where you're experiencing it. It's not something to be ashamed of, and you shouldn't feel like you need to hide it to spare others' discomfort. I mean, would you tell someone with a physical disability to just 'tough it out' in public? Nope.

My advice would be to surround yourself with people who truly get it ‚Äì like your family and friends who have seen you through treatments and recovery. And if you do have a panic attack or need reassurance in public, try not to worry about what others think. You do you, and prioritize your own well-being. We're all rooting for you.","

I think part of the anxiety comes from the fear of investing emotional energy into something and then potentially being disappointed or not enjoying it.

One thing that helped me was to start small and lower my expectations. Instead of diving into a new show or book, I'd try watching a single episode or reading a chapter. That way, I wasn't committing to a huge time investment if I didn't end up liking it.

It might also help to reframe your thinking around these activities. Instead of seeing them as a source of anxiety, try to view them as a way to take care of yourself and relax. Remember that it's okay if you don't love something ‚Äì it's not a reflection of your worth or taste.

You're definitely not alone in this, and it's great that you're acknowledging and working through these feelings. Keep taking small steps, and I hope you find more joy in your downtime activities!","

I think we all need it from time to time, but especially in today's fast-paced world where stress can easily creep in.

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we need to be constantly productive, but taking care of our mental health is just as important. By taking those few minutes to breathe and relax, you're actually investing in your overall well-being. So, don't be afraid to take that step back and prioritize yourself.

c5uovo,Anxiety,"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!",slutzombie,"I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I‚Äôm really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I‚Äôd have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do.

I totally get why you'd want to cancel - interviews can be brutal, and adding a language component can be super intimidating. It's amazing that you forced yourself to go and ended up surprising yourself with how well you did.

Your post is a great reminder that sometimes, our biggest growth moments come from facing our fears head-on. It's clear that you've been struggling with interview anxiety for a while, but this experience can be a major confidence booster for you going forward.

Whatever the outcome of this job is, you should be incredibly proud of yourself for showing up and giving it your all. That takes a ton of courage, and it's something to build on. Fingers crossed that you'll get the job and enjoy those amazing benefits, but either way, you've already won by facing your fears and coming out on top.""","

I've been there too, and I've found that setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care has been a game-changer for me. It's okay to take a step back, breathe, and focus on your own well-being. And honestly, it's not selfish ‚Äì it's necessary.

Maybe instead of robbing a bank or winning the lottery (although, let's be real, that sounds pretty appealing), you could start exploring ways to make your current work situation more manageable. Could you talk to your manager about adjusting your workload or finding ways to reduce stress? Or maybe it's time to start looking into alternative career paths that align better with your values and personality?

Remember, you're not alone in this feeling. There are plenty of people out there who are feeling the same way, and there's support available. Hang in there, and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it.","

Essentially, your brain is creating these hypothetical scenarios based on small observations, and before you know it, you're deeply invested in a fictional narrative that's causing you distress.

I've been there too. For me, it's been helpful to recognize when I'm slipping into this mode. I ask myself, 'Is this thought based in reality, or is it just a hypothetical?' If it's the latter, I try to bring myself back to the present moment and focus on what's actually happening.

Another strategy that might help is to challenge those hypothetical scenarios. Ask yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?' and 'Is that outcome even likely?' Often, just by examining these 'what ifs,' you can start to diffuse the anxiety they create.

Remember, it's okay to have these thoughts ‚Äì it doesn't mean you're flawed or weak. It's just your brain trying to prepare for potential threats. But by acknowledging and addressing them, you can start to break free from their hold.","

Anxiety can be a huge barrier to taking action, especially when it comes to something as daunting as job hunting.

First of all, just want to say that it's okay to feel this way. It doesn't mean you're lazy or unmotivated - it just means you're human and you're feeling overwhelmed.

One thing that might help is to break down the job search process into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking ""I need to get a job by the end of December"", try thinking ""I need to apply to 3 jobs this week"". That way, you're focusing on one tiny step at a time, rather than the whole big picture.

Also, don't underestimate the power of small wins. Every application you submit, every interview you nail, is a victory in itself. It might not lead to a job offer, but it's still a step in the right direction. You got this!","

Am I neglecting self-care? Recognizing the trigger has helped me address the root cause of my anxiety.

In terms of managing the physical symptoms, I've found that deep breathing exercises, meditation, and gentle yoga can really help calm my gut. Also, keeping a food diary has helped me identify which foods exacerbate my IBS symptoms. It might be worth exploring these options for yourself.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on the present moment. When I catch myself spiraling into worries about the past or future, I try to bring my attention back to what's happening right now. Take a few deep breaths, notice your surroundings, and engage with the world around you. It's amazing how much more manageable things feel when we're not getting caught up in our thoughts.

Also, try to practice some self-compassion. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Here's the thing: some teachers might not realize the impact their methods are having on students. They might think they're just ""encouraging participation"" or ""keeping kids on their toes,"" but in reality, it can be really intimidating.

If you feel comfortable, you could try talking to your teacher about how their method is affecting you. They might be willing to adjust their approach or offer extra support. Alternatively, you could also try preparing for class by reviewing the material beforehand, so you feel more confident if you do get called on.

Remember, it's okay to not know everything, and it's not your fault if you need a little extra help. Don't let this one thing get to you ‚Äì you got this!","

POST TITLE: STOP calling on me if i didn't raise my f@cking hand. i didn't raise it for a reason!!

POST BODY: why do teachers feel the need to call on kids at random when no one raises their hand? like if i knew the answer i'd raise my hand. it gives me so much anxiety when i don't know the answer to something and the teacher is calling on random people like it's a fun little game for them. they get so mad at us for not knowing the answer.. maybe start teaching better and stop trying to give kids anxiety attacks. (not all teachers are like this)

I've totally been there, and it can be really frustrating. It's like our brains are trying to prepare us for every possible scenario, but it ends up causing more stress than necessary.

For me, the key to reducing these internal arguments has been mindfulness and self-compassion. When I catch myself getting caught up in a hypothetical argument, I try to take a step back and remind myself that it's not real. I breathe, and I focus on the present moment.

It might also be helpful to identify what triggers these internal arguments for you. Are you stressed about a specific situation or relationship? Addressing the underlying issue might help reduce the frequency of these internal debates.

Remember, it's okay to have these thoughts, and it doesn't mean you're crazy or flawed. It just means your brain is trying to process and prepare for different outcomes. Be kind to yourself, and try to reframe these internal arguments as an opportunity to practice self-reflection and growth.","

I've been there too, feeling guilty for taking a break or watching a movie instead of tackling my to-do list. But I've found that when I do make time for relaxation, I'm so much more focused and productive when I get back to work. It's like my brain has been rebooted and I can tackle tasks with renewed energy and clarity.

I have panic attacks sometimes but rarely, though when I do have them they're catastrophically bad.

Mine is more as you said, constantly being on edge and sometimes I'll have waves of panic that makes my whole body clench up, my mind races and I get cold. I also constantly focus  on random bodily feelings, aches or pains and worry I'm dying. Good times.",442,Monechetti,You ever try cbd ?,1,talkingwithmasses,"Hey OP, I totally get what you're saying. I've been there too, where it's not necessarily full-blown anxiety attacks, but more of a constant, low-grade hum of anxiety in the background. It's like your nervous system is always on high alert, even when there's no obvious reason to be worried.

I've found that acknowledging and accepting this state can actually be really helpful. Instead of beating myself up over it, I try to practice self-compassion and remind myself that it's okay to feel this way. It's not something that I can just ""snap out of,"" and that's okay.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on small, manageable moments of calm throughout the day. Whether it's taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or just noticing the sensation of my feet on the ground, these little moments can help bring me back to the present and calm my nervous system. Maybe try experimenting with some of these techniques and see what works for you?","

Don't feel guilty about it! It's actually kind of liberating to let go of the pressure to be social.

If you're feeling up to it, you could even use this as an opportunity to create your own low-key celebration that feels more like you. Watch a movie, play some games, or just enjoy a quiet night in.

- Drinking herbal teas before bed

- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating ‚Äúworry time‚Äù and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on

One thing that might help, in addition to the wonderful suggestions you've listed, is to focus on the 'why' behind your bedtime routine. Instead of just doing something to calm down, try to create a narrative that signals to your brain that it's time to sleep. For example, you could tell yourself, 'I'm winding down, and I'm safe. I've got everything under control for tomorrow.' It's almost like giving your brain permission to relax.

Remember, it's a process, and it might take some experimentation to find what works for you. Be patient, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further support.

Losing a loved one is never easy, and it's especially tough when you've had time to prepare but still can't fully grasp the reality of it. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and numb, which is a completely normal response to grief.

First of all, take care of yourself right now. Make sure you're eating, drinking water, and getting some rest. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take time to process your emotions. Your body and mind are going through a lot, so be gentle with yourself.

It might be helpful to talk to someone about how you're feeling - a trusted friend, family member, or even a therapist. Sharing your emotions with someone who cares about you can be really helpful in working through your grief.

You and your family are in my thoughts, and I'm sending lots of love your way. Remember, it's okay to feel whatever emotions come your way, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.","

kssgs6,Anxiety,Do you think it's fair to say the past year has been traumatic?,tomorrowistomato,"I feel permanently changed by everything that's happened this past year. I am exhausted. I feel bitter and angry and sad. I have never hated people the way I do now. There are times that I feel like going outside and just screaming at the sky until I can't anymore.

The past year has been a collective trauma, and it's valid to acknowledge that it's had a profound impact on you. It's not just about the direct effects, but the emotional toll of living through such a chaotic and uncertain time. The feelings of exhaustion, bitterness, and anger you're experiencing are real and shouldn't be dismissed.

It might be helpful to remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay, and that you don't have to put on a brave face for others. Allow yourself to process your emotions, and don't be afraid to take time for self-care. Reach out to trusted friends or family members who might be able to offer support, or consider seeking professional help if you need it.

Remember, your feelings are valid, and it's not about being ""okay"" or ""not okay."" It's about acknowledging the pain and taking small steps towards healing. You're not alone in this, and there are people who understand what you're going through.

971qny,Anxiety,I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,saberToothedCat,"SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Thank you.",1436,88,1534191305,[deleted],90,[deleted],[deleted],90,[deleted],"""Huge props to you for taking that leap and asking her out in person. I can imagine it wasn't easy, but it's awesome that you're focusing on the pride and growth aspect of it rather than the rejection. Your psychologist's approach to exposing yourself to uncomfortable situations makes total sense - it's all about rewiring your brain to handle those feelings and build confidence.

It's also great that you're recognizing the value in this experience, even if it didn't end with a date. You're right, avoiding uncomfortable situations can lead to more fear and avoidance in the long run. By facing it head-on, you're taking a massive step towards becoming more confident and self-assured.

Keep pushing yourself to take these kinds of risks, and remember that it's okay to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable - it's all part of the process. You've got this, and it's awesome that you've got a supportive community cheering you on.""","

It's like, you're excited to share something you're passionate about, but then your inner critic kicks in and you start to worry that others might not be as interested.

Here's the thing: when you're sharing something you love, your enthusiasm is infectious. People are often more interested than you think, and even if they're not, they might appreciate your passion. The problem is, we tend to assume people are thinking the worst about us, when in reality, they might just be happy to listen.

Next time, try to focus on the excitement and joy you feel when talking about your favorite drive. Don't worry too much about what others might think. And if you do start to feel self-conscious, just acknowledge the feeling and keep going. You might be surprised by how much others appreciate your authenticity.

It perfectly captures the sensation of being 'on edge' all the time, even when everything seems fine on the surface. I think it's especially relatable because, just like Spider-Man's spider-senses, our anxiety can be triggered by things we're not even consciously aware of.

For me, the hardest part is learning to differentiate between genuine threats and false alarms. It's like our brain is constantly screaming 'danger!' even when there's no real danger present. But what I've found helpful is acknowledging those feelings without judgment, and reminding myself that just because my brain is freaking out, it doesn't mean I'm in actual danger.

I think the key here is to shift your focus from ""what should I be doing?"" to ""what do I actually want to do in this moment?"" Try to silence that inner critic that's constantly evaluating your choices. You don't need to have it all figured out right now. Allow yourself to explore, experiment, and make mistakes. Remember, it's okay to not have a single, defining passion or purpose. You can have multiple interests and still be ""you.""

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's been a decade, but that doesn't mean you've wasted all that time. You've been growing, learning, and evolving. Take a deep breath, and instead of trying to ""figure it all out,"" just allow yourself to be present in this moment.","

One thing that's helped me is to remind myself that people's rudeness often says more about them than it does about me. They might be having a bad day, or they might just be having a bad life. Either way, it's not my problem to fix.

When you start to ruminate, try to catch yourself and challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if the person's opinion really matters, and if it's worth your emotional energy. It's okay to let it go and focus on the positive interactions you have with others.

Also, try practicing some self-compassion. It's okay to feel anxious or upset, but don't beat yourself up over it. You're not alone in this, and it's a normal response to a difficult situation. Take some deep breaths, go for a walk, or do something that makes you feel good. You got this.","

j520mz,Anxiety,Has anyone else ever felt like they were losing their mind or going truly insane from anxiety/panic?,Ryanjl1985,"Edit: This has become one of those posts where I can‚Äôt reply to everyone individually but I will do my best. 

Thank you for the rewards",1335,166,1601829854,Once in a while... Yes,168,ShadowMaster0020,Sometimes I feel like I need to be committed but then the anxiety passes and I realize I am fine and do not need that.,65,jendominates,"I can totally relate to this feeling. It's like your mind is a war zone and you're just trying to survive each day without completely losing it. I've been there too, and I want you to know that you're not alone.

First of all, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. Anxiety and panic can be overwhelming, but it doesn't mean you're going crazy. It means you're struggling, and that's a brave thing to admit.

One thing that helped me was to focus on the present moment. When anxiety starts to spiral, try to bring yourself back to your five senses. What do you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel right now? It sounds simple, but it can be a powerful way to ground yourself.

Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to practice some self-compassion. You got this, even when it feels like you don't. Keep pushing forward, and know that there are people here who care about you and want to support you.","

lxmfai,Anxiety,Anyone else get horrible gastric problems from their anxiety?,FlyMeToUranus,"I already have IBS in my family (yay, me), but I‚Äôve found that my anxiety makes my stomach problems so much worse. It‚Äôs constant off-and-on problems with cramping, gas, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes outright pain. Sometimes I‚Äôll get a jolt of nerves and the suddenly I have horrible stomach pain. Other times I just feel mildly sick. It doesn‚Äôt even matter what I eat, nothing seems to help. It can be really discouraging and debilitating. When my anxiety is higher, it always makes these problems WAY worse. Then the vicious cycle begins and it gives me MORE anxiety. 

Am I alone in this? I hate anxiety!",1319,181,1614870093,"Nausea and other digestive issues are very, very normal symptoms of anxiety. 

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection

I had constant nausea for sixteen years - always queasy at a minimum, often developing to the point of vomiting...sometimes for hours on end. It's awful. Thankfully it was the first symptom to disappear when I started my SSRI but for like half my life, man...and it often resembled the stomach flu, just endless hours in the bathroom in the middle of the night anxious to the point of sickness. Especially during finals in school, the week before and the week of. Not conducive towards being a productive human being. I once had to bail on most of my accounting final because the professor banned us from leaving the room for any reason and I suddenly *had* to go - I threw the exam on her desk and bolted from the room as fast as I could, barely made it in time. I've puked in my fair share of trash cans and bushes.

Peppermint or ginger tea can help. Anxious nausea is typically due to an overproduction of acid so antacids can help. For a portable option you can try Seabands, they're marketed for motion sickness but work pretty well for anxious nausea. And Tummydrops are good to keep in your pocket at all times - they come in ten flavors at varying intensities, you can get them on Amazon.",131,larki18,Yep. I have nervous poops all the time and can expect at least one explosive poop a day. It sucks.,7,nomotaco,"I feel you, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. I also have anxiety and IBS, and it's like my stomach is a ticking time bomb just waiting for my anxiety to trigger the next episode. It's incredibly frustrating and debilitating.

One thing that has helped me is practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation. These can help calm your nervous system and reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety. I also try to keep a food diary to track any potential triggers (even though it sounds like food isn't the issue for you), and I've found that getting enough sleep and staying hydrated can make a big difference.

Remember that you're not alone in this, and it's not just about ""managing your anxiety"" - it's about taking care of your whole self, both physically and mentally. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but don't give up. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep talking about it, and seeking support - it helps to break the cycle of anxiety and shame. Sending you all the best vibes.","

Anxiety can be a real nightmare, and sometimes it's hard to put into words just how overwhelming it feels. I've been there too, and it's like your mind is racing with a million 'what-ifs' and worst-case scenarios.

When I'm feeling anxious, I try to take a step back and breathe. Literally, just take a few deep breaths in through my nose and out through my mouth. It sounds silly, but it can really help calm your nervous system down.

I also try to remind myself that anxiety is just a feeling, and it's not a reflection of reality. It's like my brain is trying to protect me from something, but it's actually just causing more stress.

You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. If you feel like you need to talk to someone, there are some great resources in the sidebar of this sub. Hang in there, friend.""","

Don't underestimate the significance of this small victory - it's a great sign that you're becoming more comfortable in your own skin. And hey, now you know that you can handle a busy coffee shop, who knows what other challenges you'll be able to tackle?

Thanks for sharing your story, and I'm happy to be here to celebrate with you. Keep being proud of yourself and taking those small steps - they add up to make a big difference.""","

It's like your brain has a ""negativity radar"" that's always on the lookout for potential threats, even when everything seems fine. This can be a tough pattern to break, but here's what I've found helpful: when that thought pops up, try not to engage with it. Instead, acknowledge it and remind yourself that it's just a thought, not a fact. You can say to yourself, ""Okay, brain, I see you're trying to stir up some anxiety. But right now, I'm doing okay, and that's what matters.""

It might also be helpful to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay not to be fully okay all the time. Nobody is. It's normal to have ups and downs, and it doesn't mean you're flawed or weak. You're just human.

Lastly, try to focus on the present moment and what's going well in your life. Sometimes, our brains can get stuck in the past or worried about the future, but the present moment is all we really have. By staying grounded in the here and now, you can reduce that anxiety and cultivate a sense of peace.","

n4ca68,Anxiety,"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!",Two-Tailed-Fox,"(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",1416,78,1620089958,"A note to those worried.

I have the same phobia but I'm gonna get the covid vaxx no matter what.

Your 'surreal moment of clarity' sounds like a really powerful experience - it's like your mind decided to take a step back and let you focus on the present moment. That's a great skill to have, and it's awesome that you were able to tap into it when you needed it most.

Remember that it's okay to feel proud of yourself for this accomplishment - it's a big deal, and you should celebrate it! And don't worry if you feel nervous about the second dose - you've already proven to yourself that you can get through it. You got this!""","

Maybe instead of beating yourself up over not 'loving' something, try to focus on the joy you get from exploring new things. Allow yourself to be a beginner, to make mistakes, and to learn without an end goal in sight. It's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to enjoy something just for the sake of enjoying it.

Try setting aside 'guilt-free' time for yourself, where you can engage in a hobby or activity without worrying about productivity. See if that helps shift your mindset, and remember that it's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being.","

One thing that might help is setting some boundaries with your mom and her friend. It might be worth having a calm conversation with them about how you feel and asking if they could knock before entering your room. It's not about being rude or unwelcoming, but about respecting your own space.

Another thing you could try is finding ways to make yourself feel more comfortable and relaxed when you're doing things in your room.

cvnazg,Anxiety,The side of anxiety most people don‚Äôt understand.,bussebailey,"Started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that I‚Äôm required to wear. Go to put one on and it doesn‚Äôt fit, none of them do. Now I‚Äôm having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I‚Äôm sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don‚Äôt fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn‚Äôt work that way. This sucks ‚òπÔ∏è",1408,81,1566821929,100% know how you feel. It gets so tiring! I don‚Äôt know how to stop doing it.,338,WhatsaGime,"When I find myself in an anxiety loop like this, I've found that practicing mindfulness helps recenter your spiraling brain.
Close your eyes, breathe deep at a steady pace, and in your head keep saying 'just this breath' along with your breathing patterns. Focusing only on your breathing helps your brain slow down. It takes practice, and your mind will wander, bring it back to your breathing. 
You realistically know that there's no actual consequences to your situation, you need to make sure that your brain also knows. 
I hope this helps ....",36,Choleric_Introvert,"I totally get it. It's like your brain is a master of worst-case scenario planning, and it's exhausting. I've been there too - getting worked up over something that, in hindsight, is probably not a big deal.

First of all, take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. Your anxiety is trying to protect you, even if it's not being super helpful right now.

When you're ready, go talk to your boss. I'm sure they've dealt with uniform issues before, and it's really not a big deal. Try to focus on the facts - ""Hey, I just got my new shirts and they don't fit. Can we order some new ones?"" - and not let your brain spin off into hypotheticals.

Remember, your worth isn't defined by this one interaction. You're a capable person who's doing your best, and that's something to be proud of. Take care of yourself today, and try to be kind to your anxious brain. It's going to be okay.","

geiyn7,Anxiety,Anyone else completely avoid tasks because they don't think they'll be good enough at it?,KatDT,"I have this a lot. I'll avoid cooking a new thing or doing a new task because I don't think I'll do a good enough job. I've noticed that a lot of my anxiety stems from a fear of disappointing other people, and I know that if I were to do a task for myself I could probably do it. But if the result affects others I completely tense up. It's like I suddenly forget to function at all if I'm given something I don't think I'll be good at. So I'll just avoid it entirely. Anyone else?",1386,103,1588767651,"Yes. But for me it goes beyond cooking, I won‚Äôt make positive life changes, like going for my MA, because I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to do it.",177,ky-98,[deleted],6,[deleted],"I totally get where you're coming from, OP. I've been there too - the fear of not meeting expectations and disappointing others can be paralyzing. It's like, if I'm not sure I'll do it perfectly, I'd rather not do it at all.

One thing that's helped me is to reframe my thinking around ""good enough."" Instead of aiming for perfection, I try to focus on learning and improving. It's okay to make mistakes - they're an opportunity to grow and learn. And, honestly, most people don't expect perfection from others. They just want to see effort and a willingness to try.

Also, try to separate your self-worth from the task at hand. Remember that your value as a person isn't defined by one task or outcome. You're more than this one thing, and it's okay to make mistakes.

Lastly, start small. Break down the task into smaller, manageable parts, and focus on one step at a time. This can help build confidence and momentum. You got this, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.","

And my mom said ‚Äúdoes that actually happen to you?‚Äù

And I just... does it not happen to most people? You mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? What? How?? 

That sounds so emotionally healthy! Meanwhile multiple times a week I lie awake at night replaying the moments I most wish hadn‚Äôt happened.

Edit: Did not know this would resonate with people... also apparently this is a symptom of my OCD!",1370,118,1586272674,"I wouldn't say it is unusual to do that every once and a while. Like once a month is probably pretty normal. If you spend almost every night doing this though, that is something to work on. It sounds like you struggle with embarrassment or fear of judgement. I used to be really bad about it, like if I said something that came across stupid or insensitive, I would apologize to that person, but I didn't forgive myself for it. I just replayed in my head how dumb it was. 

An old co-worker gave me the best advice about this. She said, no one is paying that much attention to you. It sounded mean at first but what she meant was, everyone else is so in their own head and worried about themselves that they probably will forget the dumb thing you said or did. 

It's like when you are nervous to give a speech in class. You are so afraid of messing up or everyone looking at you, but in reality, everyone else in the class is focused on being nervous themselves.

I'm one of those people who can ruminate on a single mistake for years, replaying it over and over in my head. It's like my brain is trying to 'solve' the problem or find a way to undo it, even when it's long past.

First, I want to say that it's totally normal (and relatable) that you're experiencing this. Your mom might not be aware of it, but plenty of people do struggle with rumination and post-mortem analysis of their mistakes.

As for how to move past it, I've found that practicing self-compassion and mindfulness can be super helpful. When you catch yourself rehashing old mistakes, try to acknowledge the thought and gently let it go. Remind yourself that you can't change the past, and that dwelling on it isn't going to fix anything. It's also worth considering talking to a therapist, especially since you mentioned OCD - they can help you develop strategies to manage those intrusive thoughts. Hang in there, friend - you're not alone in this!","

Just anything that reminds you that you actually exist.

Please, be kind, lads. I promise, I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. It‚Äôs not intentional.

Firstly, I want to say that your feelings are valid, but they don't necessarily reflect reality. It's easy to get caught up in our own negative thoughts and assume everyone else thinks the same way, but the truth is, most people are too busy with their own lives to even notice us, let alone hate us.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on the people who do care about me, and to remind myself that their opinions are the ones that truly matter. It's also helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep in mind that everyone struggles with these feelings, even if they don't always show it. You're not alone, and you're definitely worth more than you think.","

tension headaches. your neck doesn‚Äôt wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it‚Äôs in danger. relax that thing.

I love how you emphasized the importance of relaxing our bodies before trying to calm our minds. It's so easy to get caught up in mindfulness exercises and forget about the physical tension we're holding onto. Your post is a great reminder to take care of our physical selves, too.

It makes me filter everything I say.,8,lifethruafilter,"I totally get it. It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of social anxiety and the fear of not knowing something. I've definitely been there, and it can be really debilitating.

First of all, let me just say that it's completely okay to ask questions. In fact, it's often a sign of intelligence and a willingness to learn. People who are knowledgeable about a particular subject usually appreciate being asked questions, as it gives them an opportunity to share their expertise.

One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around asking questions. Instead of thinking ""I'm being annoying,"" try thinking ""I'm being curious and open to learning."" And if someone does react negatively, it's likely more about them than you.

It might also be helpful to remind yourself that it's okay not to know something. Nobody knows everything, and it's always better to ask questions and clarify than to pretend like you know something you don't. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's great that you're acknowledging it and seeking support.","

POST TITLE: Does anybody get anxiety from the thought of being bothersome to others?

POST BODY: My anxiety always seems to ramp up at the thought of asking any clarifying questions about something. I get the feeling that the person I'm asking the question to might think of me as annoying or stupid.

It doesn't help that I also get anxiety from not knowing how to do something or the rules for something.

One thing that's helped me is practicing mindfulness in everyday conversations. It sounds cheesy, but taking a deep breath before responding can really make a difference. It gives me a second to collect my thoughts and respond more calmly. 

Also, try to be kind to yourself when you do slip up. It's okay to make mistakes in conversations, and people are often more understanding than we think.

n8c6tk,Anxiety,A mental trick that has greatly helped me overcome anxiety.,whatevergotlaid,"Anxiety is a mental behavior. Often a worrying about the future, solving problems, ruminating about the past, overly caring what others think about you, hyper analyzing your own words or actions, etc..

And when these patterns and behaviors are noticed they are often excited by another behavior: us resisting them, or trying to hide them.

Ive found it incredibally effective to name these behaviors as if they were characters in your head, And when they appear, simply say hello to them. Maybe thank them for trying to keep you safe, and thats it. In time, they will relax, but this cant be your goal. Acceptance of them must be your goal.

Here are some of my characters:
""The reherses future conversations guy""

""The replays past social interactions guy""

""The finds reasons to avoid things guy""

""The narrator""

""The overanalyzing my owns words as i speak guy""

""The worried that future events wont happen the way I want them to guy""

""The trying to stop current behavior guy""

""The angry i was treated unfairly guy""

And i even visualize what they look like, sometimes draw them on paper. Give them a real voice and and real nod of ackowledgement, and you detach yourself from them. They eventually lose power over you.

I can totally relate to getting caught up in those patterns of negative thinking, and it's great that you've found a way to acknowledge and detach from them.

I love the idea of giving these ""characters"" names and personalities - it's a great way to externalize them and recognize that they're not the entirety of your identity. It takes a lot of self-awareness and courage to confront these patterns, and it sounds like you've made some real progress.

One thing that resonated with me is the importance of acceptance, rather than trying to resist or change these thoughts. It's so easy to get caught up in trying to ""fix"" ourselves, but sometimes just acknowledging and accepting our thoughts and emotions can be incredibly liberating.

Thanks for sharing your experience and offering some helpful advice. I'm definitely going to try this out and see how it works for me.","

I used to be extremely sensitive to criticism, and it would send me spiraling into self-doubt and anxiety. What helped me was to reframe how I think about feedback.

It might sound cheesy, but it really made a difference for me. I also started to remind myself that people often give criticism because they want to help, not because they're trying to tear me down. It's not about being ""good enough"" or not; it's about being human and making mistakes.

One thing that might be helpful is to take a step back when you receive criticism and try to identify what specifically is triggering your anxiety. Is it the fear of not being good enough? Is it the fear of being judged? Once you can pinpoint what's driving your emotions, you can start to work on addressing those underlying fears.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues?

It all comes down to harm reduction and countering shame. I've been working (with the help of my therapist) on positive self-talk and not falling into the trap of shaming myself for ""wasting time"" because shame is not a motivator. It just makes me feel worse and I go online to avoid the negative feelings and the spiral intensifies. 

I've instead been focusing on harm reduction. I can't just stop ""wasting time"" all at once, but I can get better at focusing on the task at hand. I can try to push myself a little bit more each time and then acknowledge that. So instead of the negative self-talk of ""oh no you wasted 30 minutes"" it could be ""you spent only 30 minutes on Reddit this time as opposed to 45 and then you got focused again. How can we make that time to focus shorter?"" I'm been working on using timers for work and for breaks and trying not to be angry at myself when I forget to set them or follow them. 

It all boils down to self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself. And remember one more important detail: internalized capitalism is the worst. You have value irrespective of what you accomplish. You are not worthless because you haven't produced what you want or feel like you need to produce. You are not a robot and you are going to have days when you feel really productive and days when you need to just curl up into a ball and wait for the day to go by. What's important is to be able to tell the difference between the two.",124,Emperor_Pengwing,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get it. It's like this vicious cycle where you're so worried about wasting time, you end up paralyzing yourself and not doing anything. I've been there, and it's frustrating.

Firstly, kudos to you for recognizing this pattern and seeking help. That's already a huge step forward. One thing that might help is reframing your thinking around ""productivity."" Instead of focusing on how much you're achieving, try to focus on the process itself. Break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and celebrate each tiny win.

It's also important to acknowledge that some days are just going to be tough. Anxiety and depression can be overwhelming, and it's okay to take a step back and prioritize self-care. Don't beat yourself up over it ‚Äì just acknowledge the feeling and gently nudge yourself back on track when you're ready.

Remember, progress is not always linear, and it's the small, consistent steps that count. You got this, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Keep going, and don't give up on yourself.","

POST TITLE: I‚Äôm so worried about wasting my time that I wind up wasting my time

POST BODY: It sucks. I‚Äôm sure all of us have these days where we have a whole list of goals we want to accomplish but our time anxiety gets the best of us. 

I‚Äôve tried doing the small goals approach, but I wind up feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. My lack of self motivation is so atrocious it‚Äôs a miracle I can wake up at normal times.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues? It sucks because I want to continue with my future but my complacency from anxiety and depression just wraps itself around me.

First of all, you're not alone, and it's great that you found a name for it - ""cringe attacks"" is a pretty fitting term. But I also appreciate the edit where you mentioned that it could be related to intrusive thoughts and OCD. It's essential to acknowledge that these thoughts can be a normal part of being human, but our reactions to them can sometimes indicate a deeper issue.

If you do find that these cringe attacks are affecting your daily life or mood, don't hesitate to reach out to a professional for guidance.

Sometimes I will literally freeze in social situations where I want to speak but it feels like there's an actual wall stopping me from speaking.

I've struggled with anxiety too, and it's so frustrating when people think it's just about panic attacks or being 'nervous.'

I've found that it's helpful to remind myself (and others, when I need to) that anxiety is a spectrum, and everyone experiences it differently. It's not always about being 'on the edge' ‚Äì sometimes it's just a dull hum in the background that you can't shake.

If you don't mind me asking, have you talked to a therapist or healthcare professional about your anxiety? They can help you develop coping strategies and work through some of the underlying issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. And in the meantime, take care of yourself ‚Äì prioritize self-care, exercise, and getting enough sleep. You're not alone in this, and I'm sending you all the best vibes.","

gmezo7,Anxiety,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?",[deleted],"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

It‚Äôs so wonderfully comforting to know that I‚Äôm not the only one going through this.",1328,117,1589851993,"Sounds more like an anxiety attack (which is different than a panic attack).

I've had similar ""functioning"" panic attacks where I can appear fine on the outside, but inside, I'm a complete mess.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone, and your feelings are valid. It takes a lot of courage to share your experience, and I'm so glad you did. The fact that you're able to mask your panic attacks doesn't mean they're not real. It just means you've developed coping mechanisms to deal with them, which is actually a testament to your strength.

I want to encourage you to keep seeking help from doctors and therapists until you find someone who understands and believes you. It's essential to have a supportive team that can help you develop strategies to manage your anxiety. Remember, you don't have to put on a brave face all the time. It's okay to ask for help and take time for yourself. You deserve it.","

jcwbws,Anxiety,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,State-City,"I‚Äôm a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

Edit: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE KIND WORDS! This means so much to me. My goal was to share my experience and maybe it could help others. You guys are all so kind :)",1357,87,1602945834,GOOD JOB !! c:&lt;,50,Shnokio,GOOD JOB !! c:&lt;,50,Shnokio,"""Huge congratulations to you for taking this massive step in overcoming your social anxiety and depression. It's amazing to see how far you've come in just 10 months. I can only imagine how scary it must have been to get out of the car that first time, but it's clear that your persistence and determination paid off.

I love the approach you took, gradually getting comfortable with the park surroundings and building up to walking. It's a great reminder that progress doesn't have to be giant leaps - small, consistent steps can be just as powerful.

Your routine of journaling, walking, and meditating sounds like a great way to maintain momentum and take care of yourself. Remember to be kind to yourself on the tough days, too - it's okay to have setbacks, and it doesn't mean you're failing.

Thanks for sharing your story - it's inspiring and hopeful, and I'm sure it will help others who are struggling with similar issues. Keep celebrating your wins, no matter how small they may seem!""","

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

Edit: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE KIND WORDS! This means so much to me. My goal was to share my experience and maybe it could help others. You guys are all so kind :)

You want to be able to manage anxiety instead of it preventing you from enjoying life and realizing your goals.,78,imjacksissue,"""I completely get it, OP. Anxiety can be such a weight on our daily lives, making even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. I think it's amazing that you're recognizing what's truly important to you - your mental well-being.

While we can't just wave a magic wand and make anxiety disappear, there are some strategies that might help you cope. Have you considered mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing exercises? These can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety in the moment.

Additionally, reaching out to a therapist or counselor can be a great way to work through underlying issues that may be contributing to your anxiety. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we need help, but it's often the first step towards healing.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are many people who struggle with anxiety, and there's a whole community of support out there. Keep taking care of yourself and know that better days are ahead.""","

kimsaw,Anxiety,Fuck anxiety. Like seriously fuck it.,thicccmadlad75,I fucking hate living with anxiety. It sucks so much. Like why does it have to exist. All it does is fuck with peoples lives. I fucking hate it. Life would be 100 times better without it like fuck.,1276,163,1608700353,I'm with you üò™,155,rodentfarm,[deleted],-1,[deleted],"I feel you, anxiety can be an absolute nightmare. It's like having a constant companion that's always whispering worst-case scenarios in your ear. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, living with anxiety is tough. But here's the thing - you're not alone in this.

One thing that might help is reframing your relationship with anxiety. Instead of fighting it, try to acknowledge it as a part of your life (for now, at least). When you feel that familiar knot in your stomach, try saying 'oh, anxiety's here' and take a deep breath. It's not about accepting it, but about not letting it consume you.

You might also want to explore some anxiety management techniques like mindfulness, exercise, or journaling. They can help you cope with those overwhelming feelings. And hey, it's okay to not be okay. You don't have to put on a brave face all the time. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist when you need support. You got this, and there are people who care about you. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels like a tiny step at a time.","

j8tkja,Anxiety,Stop telling me everyone has anxiety!,hr0519,"I understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. But it‚Äôs still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear.

Sorry for the rambling to whoever actually read this.

It's like, just because anxiety is common, doesn't mean it's not still a really tough and personal struggle. I think it's because people often try to relate and minimize their own anxiety, but in doing so, they end up minimizing yours too. 

It's not about being a ""special case,"" but rather about acknowledging that everyone's experience with anxiety is unique. I love that you pointed out the importance of mental health education - it's so true. The more we learn and understand, the better equipped we'll be to support each other.

I want to say ""thank you for telling me"" - it takes so much courage to open up about your struggles, especially when you're feeling isolated. Keep in mind that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to need help. If you ever need someone to talk to, there are people here who care and are listening.","

It's crazy how our minds can spiral out of control, isn't it? I'm definitely guilty of replaying awkward moments over and over in my head, cringing at my own mistakes.

Here's the thing: it's totally normal to feel this way. We all have those moments where we wish we could take back what we said or did. But the good news is that it's not about the mistake itself, it's about how we respond to it. You freaked out because you cared about how others perceived you, and that's a sign that you're a considerate person.

Next time (because let's face it, there will be a next time), try to catch yourself when you start replaying the moment in your head. Take a deep breath, remind yourself that it's not the end of the world, and focus on what you can learn from the experience. And hey, it's great that you have some clarity now and know that it wasn't about you. Be kind to yourself, and try to shake off that lingering frustration. You got this!","

It's overwhelming to see what's going on in the world, and as a US citizen, it can be especially tough to feel a sense of control or agency. 

First of all, just want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid - it's normal to feel anxious or helpless when faced with uncertainty and chaos. That being said, I want to remind you that you're not alone in this feeling. There are people all around you who are going through the same emotions, and there are resources available to help you cope.

One thing that might help is taking a step back and focusing on what you can control in your own life. Take care of yourself, prioritize self-care, and engage in activities that bring you joy and calm. It's also important to stay informed, but set boundaries around your news consumption and social media use - it's okay to take a break and prioritize your mental health. Remember, you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Hang in there, friend.","

As for who you could've been, I want to suggest that maybe you are still that person, just with a different path. Anxiety might have altered some decisions, but it's also given you a unique perspective and resilience that not everyone has.

Rather than beating yourself up over what could've been, try to focus on what you can do now. Take small steps towards the life you want, even if it's just one tiny thing a day. Celebrate those tiny wins, and remind yourself that you're not defined by your anxiety.

You're not alone in this feeling, and I'm so glad you're talking about it. Keep sharing, and know that there are people here who understand and support you.","

azrmao,Anxiety,I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,ThomasDHL,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

Edit 2: Wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. I've read all of them and I am speechless. Also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, I appreciate it very much. I don't really know what to say, this community is so kind.

It takes a lot of courage to share something like this, and I want you to know that you're not alone. Dealing with anxiety and panic attacks can be really tough, especially in a high-pressure situation like a new job.

First of all, please don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not know everything right away. If anything, this experience shows that you're willing to try and face your fears head-on.

It sounds like the job might not have been the best fit for you, and that's okay too. You deserve a work environment that supports and understands you. Keep in mind that this is just a minor setback, and you have so much potential. You've already got a new interview lined up, which is amazing!

Remember that your worth and identity aren't defined by this one experience. You're more than this job, and you're capable of so much more. Keep pushing forward, and know that you have a supportive community behind you.","

What if you can barely sleep cause of anxiety? Fun fun fun,75,lostallhope4,"Hey there, I totally get what you're going through. It's like your bed becomes this temporary escape from the stress and anxiety that awaits you outside. Waking up can feel like being thrown back into reality, and it's overwhelming.

First of all, just want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's not uncommon, and it doesn't mean you're failing or anything. It just means you're dealing with some heavy stuff.

One thing that might help is to create a gentle morning routine that eases you into the day. Maybe try some deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even just a short walk outside. Sometimes, taking a few minutes to calm your mind and body can make a big difference.

Also, consider talking to someone about what's stressing you out. Whether it's a friend, family member, or mental health professional, sharing your feelings can be a huge relief. You don't have to face this alone. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and it's a sign of strength, not weakness.","

It sounds like you're stuck in this never-ending cycle of rumination, and it's exhausting. I've been there too, and it's so frustrating when people tell you to just ""stop overthinking."" It's not that easy, is it?

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this. Many people experience this kind of anxiety and overthinking, and it's not because you're flawed or weak. It's just that your brain is wired to think a lot, and sometimes it can be hard to turn it off.

One thing that might help is to try and acknowledge these thoughts without judgment. When you notice yourself getting caught up in a negative train of thought, try to say to yourself, ""Okay, I'm thinking this right now. That's okay."" Don't try to push the thoughts away or beat yourself up over them. Just observe them, and then gently bring your focus back to the present moment.

Also, have you considered trying mindfulness meditation or journaling? These can be great tools for helping to calm the mind and break the cycle of rumination.","

I start screaming &amp; cursing :) .",62,M313M313,"I totally feel you, OP. Those random cringe flashbacks can be brutal. It's like your brain is trying to torture you with memories of past embarrassments. I've been there too, and it's awful.

Here's what helps me: when those thoughts come up, I try to acknowledge them without judgment. I remind myself that I was a different person back then, and that I've grown and learned from those experiences. It's not about beating myself up over past mistakes, but about recognizing that I'm not defined by them.

It might also help to practice some self-compassion. Be kind to yourself, just like you would to a friend in the same situation. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and that it's okay not to be perfect. Take a few deep breaths, and try to ground yourself in the present moment. You are not that person from 5 years ago; you're a stronger, wiser version of yourself now.

Hang in there, and know that you're not alone in this.","

That's an incredible achievement, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself. It takes a lot of courage and strength to overcome the struggles you've faced.

I love the idea of getting tattoos to cover your scars - it's a beautiful way to reclaim your body and turn something painful into something empowering. Saving up for them might take some time, but it'll be worth it in the end.

Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate this milestone, but also don't put too much pressure on yourself to 'move on' from your past. It's okay to still have tough days and to acknowledge the struggles you've faced. You've come a long way, but it's also important to recognize that your journey is ongoing.

Keep pushing forward, and remember that you're not alone in this. You've got a community of people who care about you and are rooting for your success. Keep going, you're doing amazing.""","

One thing that's helped me is to focus on what I can control, rather than worrying about what might happen. So, instead of catastrophizing when my boss wants to chat, I try to think, 'okay, what can I learn from this conversation?' or 'what can I do to improve?'

It's also worth reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's not the end of the world. You're not defined by one bad day or one mistake. You are so much more than that.

It's like you're stuck in this anxiety loop, where the end of sleep and the start of a new day feels overwhelming. I've been there too, and it's honestly really tough to deal with.

One thing that helps me is to try and break down the day into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of thinking about the entire day ahead, I focus on what I need to do in the next hour or so. It makes it feel less daunting, you know?

Also, have you tried setting a gentle morning routine for yourself? Something like reading a book, taking a short walk, or doing some light stretching can help ease you into the day. It's not about avoiding the day, but about giving yourself a gentle transition from sleep to wakefulness.

First of all, take a deep breath and know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with the monotony and stress of their jobs. It's okay to acknowledge that it's not working for you right now.

I would encourage you to take a step back and assess what's really going on here. Is it just the job itself, or is it the constant pressure to socialize and perform that's getting to you? Are there any aspects of your job that you actually enjoy? Identifying what's really causing your stress might help you find ways to cope or make changes.

Also, please take care of yourself and prioritize your basic needs, like food and rest. You deserve better than to be struggling to make ends meet. If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for support, or look into local resources that can help.","

7ro9rp,Anxiety,"My biggest fear is that my anxiety will always keep me in my ""safe zone"" causing me to live a life of mediocrity that I will one day really regret.",yoginurse26,Currently trying to tackle this issue but its my biggest challenge. ,1297,112,1516423380,"I feel the same way, friends have all moved off. I'm taking online classes for a ""safer"" career, living with my mom. I let my fear freeze me. It happens on a momentary scale like when I can't react and get in a car wreck. But I realized it's on a large, life scale. I'm too scared to move away. Too scared when I try to go on a date with a girl. Too scared of reality so I dissociate and run away with TV or games (used to be drugs and liquor). I'm just too afraid of everything. On lots of meds, but they don't help like they did at first. It doesn't get better, the future only gets worse as old people die and leave, and no new people come in. I know that's distorted thinking, but, I don't know.

The only thing I know is to get out of your comfort zone and meet new people, but where exactly? 

I know how you feel, I just don't know how to fix this and live a life where I change it up from time to time and have fun.",137,MorphineDream,"I wrote about the life I want and changed it to life I need. It helps me to remember not to compromise my life for fears.

Do you have a plan? ",30,zimgotreal,"I totally get it, OP. It's like, you're aware of this self-imposed ceiling, but the fear of venturing beyond it is paralyzing. I've been there too, and it's a tough cycle to break.

Here's the thing, though: your 'safe zone' might feel comfortable, but it's not necessarily a guarantee of happiness or fulfillment. Sometimes, the things that scare us the most are the ones that can lead to the most growth. It's all about taking small, manageable steps outside of your comfort zone.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself to make drastic changes overnight. Start with tiny, incremental steps. Take a class, attend a meetup, or try a new hobby ‚Äì anything that makes you feel slightly uncomfortable, but not overwhelmed.

Remember, it's okay to take it slow and make mistakes. You're not going to regret trying; you'll regret not trying. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny bit each day. You've got this, and there's a whole community here cheering you on.","

kwxnjs,Anxiety,I wish there was a 'close all tabs' button for racing thoughts.,SecretlyFallingApart,"I got jealous, of my own phone being able to close all open tabs with just one button.... Yep it's one of those nights....",1353,56,1610596206,"This is basically what antipsychotics e.g. quetiapine are like. Can't have racing thoughts if you can't have *any* thoughts \*taps head\*.

But, personally, I find mindfulness can sort of achieve this with sufficient practice. It's less a ""Close All Tabs"" and more a ""Task Manager"", where you open up to the thoughts chasing you, recognise them simply as just thoughts, and let them pass on through as you ever-eternally return your focus to the present senses/breath/whatever.",99,TheLastHayley,,0,,"I completely get it. Those racing thoughts can be overwhelming, and it feels like there's no 'exit' button in sight. It's almost as if our minds are constantly multitasking, making it hard to focus on just one thing.

Firstly, just know that you're not alone in this. It's normal to have nights like this, and it doesn't define your entire mental state. When you feel like you're drowning in thoughts, try the 'brain dump' technique ‚Äì write down everything that's going through your mind. Sometimes putting your thoughts on paper can help you process and clear your mental space.

Another thing that might help is setting a 'shutdown' routine for your mind. Try practicing deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or even a short meditation session. This can help calm your mind and slow down those racing thoughts. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Hang in there, and know that tomorrow's a new day.","

It's natural to feel apprehensive about sharing your thoughts, especially when there's a possibility of criticism or downvotes.

It might help to remember that people here are more likely to respond to genuine, thoughtful comments than to troll or downvote just for the sake of it. Of course, there are exceptions, but they're not the norm.

If you're worried about unpopular opinions, try framing them as questions or discussions instead of statements. This way, you're opening up a dialogue rather than presenting a definitive stance. And hey, even if you do get downvoted, it's not the end of the world. It's just a number, and it doesn't define your worth or the value of your thoughts.

One thing that might help is to acknowledge that those physical feelings are real, even if your brain is telling you there's no reason to be anxious. It's not about 'agreeing' with your brain, but about recognizing that your body is responding to some perceived threat, even if it's not rational.

Try to focus on calming your body, rather than just telling it to shut down. Take some deep breaths, go for a walk, or do some physical relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation or yoga. Sometimes, our bodies just need a little extra TLC to catch up with our brains. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious sometimes, and it doesn't mean you're not rational or in control. You got this!","

I see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and I get it, I'm in that boat too. So I want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.

If you leave your username I'll go through, when I'm bored, and send you a private message asking ""are you ok?""

You can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and I'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""Fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*""

Edit: Wow it went from 6 to 56 in an hour, I thought 30 would be a good number but this is also good.

OP, I just wanted to say thank you for creating this post. It's amazing that you're willing to reach out and offer support to strangers who might be struggling. I'm definitely in the same boat as you, and it's comforting to know I'm not alone.

I love that you're giving people the option to respond with just a yes or no, or to share more if they feel comfortable. Sometimes all we need is someone to listen, and it sounds like you're willing to be that person.

As someone who's struggled with anxiety and feeling isolated, I can attest to how much a simple ""are you ok?"" can mean. It's a reminder that we're not alone, and that someone cares.

If you're feeling overwhelmed with the responses, don't hesitate to reach out for support yourself. Remember to take care of yourself in the process of checking in on others. You're doing something amazing here, and I'm grateful to be a part of it.","

bd4pu0,Anxiety,Does anyone else think up scenarios of how things will play out and get extremely worked up and anxious about it?,ConventionalizedSoy,Any help or advice would be great,1281,110,1555260526,‚ÄúWe suffer more in imagination than in reality.‚Äù  is a great quote I‚Äôm trying to be more mindful of.,182,OhhLawd,"All the time. Last year when my anxiety went through the roof, and depression took a hold of me (I still have depression, but much much less than last year), I had to plan out everything from getting out of my apartment to which bus I was going to take to go to college to what streets I would walk on. It was horrible. I still plan out a lot of things though. For example, tomorrow I'm planning on going to Starbucks after college to grab a coffee and read a book. 

When I get worked up on whether I'll be able to make it to a certain place I try to relax and have deep a breath. I usually head out a while early just so I have peace of mind that I'll get there on time.

If you want to talk about it privately you can private message me :)",13,Mr_Phantoms,"Hey there, I totally get it. I'm a chronic scenario-builder myself, and it can be exhausting. I've found that my brain likes to take a hypothetical situation and just run with it, creating all these worst-case scenarios that leave me feeling anxious and on edge.

One thing that's helped me is to recognize when I'm doing this and actively try to bring myself back to the present moment. It sounds simple, but it's actually really hard to do. Try taking a few deep breaths, noticing your surroundings, and reminding yourself that the scenarios you're playing out in your head aren't real.

Another thing that's helped is to challenge my thoughts by asking myself if they're based in reality. Is this really likely to happen? Or am I just catastrophizing? It's not always easy to separate fact from fiction, but it can help to calm things down.

Lastly, try to practice some self-compassion. It's okay to have these thoughts and feelings ‚Äì it doesn't mean you're flawed or weak. You're just a human with a really active imagination.","

Hearing ""I have bad news"" can be like a trigger word that sets off a chain reaction of worst-case scenarios in our minds.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking when you hear those words. When someone says ""I have bad news,"" you could respond with something like, ""Okay, what's going on?"" or ""What's the situation?"" This helps to focus on the actual issue rather than letting your imagination run wild.

It's also worth remembering that most people don't mean to cause anxiety with those words ‚Äì they're often just trying to prepare you for something. So, take a deep breath, remind yourself that it's probably not as bad as you think, and try to focus on the facts.

bl28b0,Anxiety,"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?",MermaidZombie,"This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety.

It can be really frustrating feeling like the ""pity friend"" and struggling to connect with others on a deeper level. I've been there too, and it's like you're stuck on the outside looking in.

First of all, try to reframe the way you think about people being nice to you. Instead of assuming it's out of pity, maybe they're just genuinely interested in being kind and considerate. Not everyone has the same level of comfort with physical touch or witty banter, and that's okay.

One thing that might help is to focus on finding common interests and shared experiences with others. When you're passionate about something, you tend to come alive and connect with others on a more authentic level. Don't be afraid to take the lead and suggest doing something that you love ‚Äì it can be a great way to build connections and break down those boundaries.

Remember, you don't have to be like everyone else to be worthy of love and connection. You're unique, and that's something to be celebrated. Keep being yourself, and the right people will appreciate you for who you are.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?

POST BODY: This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety.

People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

hhu9ig,Anxiety,who 'staying up super fucking late cause they're too worried about tomorrow' gang?,[deleted],"i maybe kinda lost my job? and maybe kinda have to talk to him about it?

oh and also i have a fair bit of studying to do. 

so imma stay up late and listen to mazzy star and pretend i don't exist",1325,63,1593409543,"Well this hit home. 
I don't want tomorrow...today to come.

Lost my job pretty suddenly too on Friday. Have to deal tomorrow. Ugh",102,crownbiotch,"Whenever a bad anxiety cycle kicks in with me, I LOVE staying up late.

1. Its quiet and there are less things to stress me, such as daytime responsibilities.
2. I watch TV shows and things that give me comfort, like old sitcoms and movies from 'back in the day'.
3. Late night ice cream is a delight.

The worst thing is hearing the birds chirping knowing that its over and Im going to pay a daytime price.

Its best not to do it, but its easy to do.",64,ZexMurphy,"Hey OP, I'm definitely part of that 'staying up super late' gang. I've lost count of how many nights I've spent lying awake, worrying about the next day's problems.

First off, take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's normal to worry when your job's uncertain and you've got a tough conversation ahead. But try not to let those thoughts consume you.

Mazzy Star's a great choice to unwind, btw. Sometimes, just existing in the moment (even if that moment is 3 AM) can be really helpful. As for the studying, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks. You got this.

As for the conversation with your boss... just be honest and prepared. It's not gonna be easy, but it's a stepping stone to figuring out what's next. You're stronger than you think, and you'll get through this.

Hang in there, and try to get some rest when you can. You're not alone in this.","

I've been down that rabbit hole before, and it's a vicious cycle. You start with a legitimate concern, but before you know it, you're convinced you have some rare disease. It's like your brain is wired to focus on the 1% chance of something going horribly wrong, instead of the 99% chance that you're fine.

I completely agree that taking a step back and putting the phone down is key. It's hard, but sometimes the best thing you can do is wait for a doctor's appointment and get a real diagnosis. In the meantime, try to focus on self-care and things that bring you joy. Exercise, meditation, and spending time with loved ones can all help calm those anxious thoughts.

If you're struggling with health anxiety, consider talking to a therapist who can help you develop coping strategies. Remember, your health is important, but so is your mental well-being. Take care of yourself, and try not to let Dr. Google dictate your worries.","

My parents said I was lazy, my friends thought I was depressed. Nope, I just really love sleep because it's like a vacation for me. And I think being anxious all the time really does make you tired. It's incredibly draining. To me, being tired from being anxious feels exactly the same like feeling tired from medication. Kinda fuzzy, warm and it's nearly impossible to keep my eyes open. The only thing that's helping me is staying busy, which means that even in my freetime I'll constantly do stuff because if I don't, I either worry about the stuff I should be doing or fall asleep and worry even more when I wake up again. This lifestyle is working for me, for now. I honestly don't know what I'll do when I'm older and simply can't function on the level I'm at now. I don't have any experience with anxiety medication so I can't really say if there's a medical way to fix this. Occupational Therapy can help though.

I've been there too, where the physical sensations of anxiety feel overwhelming and it's hard to escape them.

Firstly, just want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean you're weak or flawed. It's actually a sign that your brain is trying to protect you from perceived threats.

One thing that might help is to explore relaxation techniques that can calm your nervous system, even when you're awake. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation might be worth trying. You can start with short sessions, like 5-10 minutes, and see how it goes.

Also, have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about your anxiety? They can help you work through underlying issues and develop coping strategies that don't involve sleeping all day.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Hang in there, and don't give up.","

I think it's really great that you're acknowledging your anxiety and recognizing what works for you. Not everyone needs or wants a job that's constantly pushing them out of their comfort zone. Predictability can be a huge source of comfort and stability, and that's totally valid.

One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around what a ""fulfilling"" job means to you. It doesn't have to mean constant excitement or novelty. It could mean a sense of security, routine, and mastery over your work. And that's just as valuable.

You're not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and preferences when it comes to your career.","

I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life.

It's truly inspiring to see how far you've come in just a year. I can only imagine how tough it must've been to go from being bedridden by anxiety to assisting in a high-pressure surgical procedure.

Your experience is a powerful reminder that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It's amazing that you're still committed to therapy and medication - it's clear that it's been a game-changer for you.

One thing that really stood out to me is how you used the skills you learned in therapy to talk yourself down from a panic attack in a really intense situation. That's not just a testament to your own strength, but also to the effectiveness of CBT and therapy in general.

If I could add one thing to your advice, it's that progress is rarely linear. There will be ups and downs, but it's clear that you're on the right path. Keep sharing your story and inspiring others - you're making a difference just by being open and honest about your struggles.""","

fbq6n2,Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),berghain_s_1993,"Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?",1300,78,1583044265,"Very much struggling with this now.

Also, I think we are all so hard on ourselves about this kind of stuff. We don‚Äôt need to be super busy all the time. It‚Äôs ok to just take it easy (in moderation of course).",12,theverticalgiraffe,"I totally get it, and I'm so glad you shared this. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling stuck and lonely. First of all, you're not a lazy POS - it's clear that you're struggling with some deep-seated feelings and habits.

It sounds like you've grown up feeling like you're on the outside looking in, and that can be really tough to shake. As an introvert, it's totally normal to crave alone time, but it's also understandable that you're craving human connection.

One thing that might help is to try to find a balance between your need for solitude and your need for social connection. Instead of feeling like you need to go all out and plan a big night out, maybe start small. Take a walk around the block, grab a coffee, or meet a friend for a low-key hangout.

It might also be helpful to explore why you're feeling so anxious about socializing. Is it the fear of being overwhelmed, or is it something else? Working through those feelings might help you feel more comfortable reaching out to others.

Remember, you're not alone in this - lots of people struggle with feelings of loneliness and disconnection. You're taking the first step by acknowledging your feelings and reaching out for support. Keep going, and don't be too hard on yourself.","

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?

lhv5i1,Anxiety,Does anyone else always think they've done something wrong?,Beanboiproductions,"Hi all. I just wanted to vent a little here. When it comes to messaging, I always feel like I've done something to offend my friends or something. Like, if they dont respond to my messages after a while, I start to feel like I did something wrong and now they hate me. Or whenever I call and they dont answer, I feel like they dont want to talk to me anymore. The obvious and logical answer is that they're busy, but anxiety doesn't give a fuck about logic. Right now, one of my friends hasn't messaged me back in about a week, and my anxiety just tells me stuff like, ""What if they're not busy and just ignoring me because they hate me."" That's my biggest anxiety problem right now. And then I start to get worried that I'm too clingy and that makes my anxiety worse, making me hate everything. Does anyone else get this, and if so, how do I fix it?",1258,119,1613078581,"I 100% relate to that feeling...I'm ALWAYS worried if I've offended someone or if I said something that could be misconstrued. It's still something I'm working on, but it's always nice to talk to someone who will tell you you're overthinking (in a nice way). I have a friend who also has anxiety but in a very different way, and we're always consulting each other so that we don't overthink too much. That being said, I still do it a lot, and it may be counterintuitive to have to rely on someone to check your thoughts. I don't have any great advice but I just wanted you to know you're not alone.",104,erodedfacade,"Ask yourself why you really want to be around this person. - They haven't bothered to check in/ see what's up/ shoot the shit lately?   They genuinely might be too busy, but if I ever find myself asking why someone isn't getting back to me, I conclude it doesn't matter. If they call back, great. If not - I've got more important things to brood over. I imagine you do too. 

Let out a breath and say fuck 'em. Not worth your time? They're definitely not worth mine. Don't hold a grudge though. People are allowed to have feelings and opinions. If you find people that don't like you - do not strive for approval. Consider it a plus - one less person to worry about. Frees up precious space to worry about other things.",30,StockHuman,"I totally get where you're coming from. I've been there too, and it's like our brains are wired to assume the worst-case scenario. It's exhausting and frustrating, especially when you know logically that your friends are probably just busy.

One thing that has helped me is reminding myself that people's responses (or lack thereof) often have zero to do with our worth or actions. It's like, they're dealing with their own stuff, and we're just a tiny part of their lives. I also try to focus on the fact that my friends have consistently shown up for me in the past, so it's unlikely they're suddenly ignoring me.

Another thing you could try is communicating your feelings with your friends. Let them know how you're feeling, and ask if everything is okay. Sometimes just talking it out can help alleviate those anxious thoughts. Lastly, practice some self-compassion ‚Äì it's okay to have these feelings, and it doesn't mean you're too clingy or needy. You're just someone who cares deeply about your relationships. Hang in there, and remember you're not alone in this!","

For anyone who's struggled with anxiety or panic attacks, it's a great example of how exposure therapy can work (even if it's not traditional therapy). You faced your fears head-on and came out on top.

Keep pushing forward and enjoy the process of learning to drive. Don't be too hard on yourself if you do encounter setbacks - just remember how far you've come already. You got this!""","

No matter how many times you've come out the other side unscathed, that voice in your head is still screaming 'this time is different, this time you're going to lose control.'

One thing that helped me is to acknowledge that it's okay to feel scared, and that it's normal for your brain to respond that way. Rather than fighting it, try to observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance - like you're a spectator watching yourself have a panic attack. It sounds silly, but it can help you detach from the emotions and remember that you've been through this before.

Also, try to focus on your physical sensations - your breath, your heartbeat, the feeling of your feet on the ground. It can help ground you in the present moment and remind you that you're safe.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Panic attacks are tough, but you're tougher.","

jkugv8,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel a massive surge in anxiety and hopelessness when the weather turns all dark and gloomy? Once autumn kicks in properly I just feel like my life‚Äôs about to end,lilly_bean,Edit-thanks everyone for all the comments and hugs. I got so many useful tips!!,1192,183,1604054635,"It's the other way for me.

I've experienced it myself, and it's like the darkness outside seems to seep into our minds too. It sounds like you might be dealing with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is pretty common.

One thing that's helped me is establishing a consistent morning routine, even on gloomy days. Getting some natural light (or using a light therapy lamp), exercising, and meditating can really help shift my mood. It's also essential to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy.

It might sound cheesy, but reminding yourself that this feeling is temporary can be super helpful. The seasons will change again, and the sun will come back. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Keep seeking support and take care of yourself - you got this!

(P.S. If you haven't already, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for personalized guidance. They can help you develop a plan to cope with SAD and other mental health challenges.)","

I think it's safe to say many of us can relate to feeling like work is a major source of anxiety in our lives. It's like, if we didn't have to deal with the stress, pressure, and uncertainty of our jobs, we'd be free to just enjoy life without that constant weight on our shoulders.

That being said, it's not always possible to just quit our jobs (although, I'm sure many of us have fantasized about it). One thing that's helped me cope with work-related anxiety is setting clear boundaries and prioritizing self-care. Whether it's taking a walk during lunch, practicing deep breathing exercises, or simply saying no to tasks that feel overwhelming, it's essential to find ways to manage your stress levels.

Remember, you're not alone in this feeling. Many of us are right there with you, struggling to find a balance between our work and personal lives. Keep taking care of yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out for support when you need it.","

First of all, please know that it's amazing that you're in group therapy and actively seeking help - that takes a lot of courage.

One thing that might help is to try and reframe your thinking around social situations. Instead of focusing on what could go wrong, try to focus on what you're excited about (e.g., celebrating the bride-to-be). Remind yourself that people are usually more focused on themselves than on judging you. And hey, it's okay to make mistakes - it's all part of being human.

I'm so glad you mentioned Parks and Rec, B99, and Kim's Convenience - those are all amazing comfort shows.

Considering you've already tried Schitt's Creek and didn't quite click with it, I'd recommend checking out other lighthearted comedies like:

- The Good Place (thought-provoking, yet quirky and fun)
- Gilmore Girls (heartwarming, witty, and cozy)
- New Girl (quirky humor, lovable characters)
- Hart of Dixie (charming, small-town vibes)
- Abbott Elementary (fresh, witty, and full of heart)

These shows share a similar tone and style with the ones you've already enjoyed. They're all relatively light on drama and meanness, focusing more on humor and character development.

Remember, taking care of your mental health is essential, and indulging in comfort shows is a great way to do that. Hope you find something that brings you joy and relaxation!","

cj5fn6,Anxiety,Does anybody get anxiety because of too much empathy?

I had no idea so many people felt this way too and i feel much less alone. Wishing everyone peace,1267,98,1564369249,"Yeah, it's usually because I feel like I'm supposed to drop everything and do whatever I can to help. As if I'm the one responsible for fixing everyone's problems (even the ones that only exist in my head). It is stupid and exhausting.",207,CardinalPeeves,,0,,"I'm so glad you posted this and received the supportive responses you did. I totally get what you're saying - having too much empathy can be overwhelming and even debilitating at times. It's like you're shouldering the weight of everyone else's emotions, and it's exhausting.

One thing that's helped me is to practice self-compassion and set boundaries. It's okay to acknowledge someone's struggles without taking them on as your own. You can offer a kind thought or a listening ear without absorbing their emotions.

It might also be helpful to focus on the things you can control, like spreading kindness and positivity in your own community. Sometimes, feeling like you're making a difference in a small way can help counterbalance the feelings of overwhelm.

Remember, being empathetic is a gift, but it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being. You can't pour from an empty cup, so make sure you're taking care of yourself too. Sending you peace and solidarity!","

Everyone else sees the funny post and wants to ask me one question about my life and expects me to ask them endless questions about their‚Äôs.

It's like your brain is saying, ""Nope, that's too much effort,"" and suddenly you're stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety and disconnection.

First of all, just want to say that it's amazing you're acknowledging this and being honest about it. That's a huge step. Now, I'm no expert, but I've found that breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps can help. Instead of thinking, ""I need to call my friend and catch up for hours,"" try saying, ""I'll just send a quick text to say hi."" That way, it's not as overwhelming.

Also, don't be too hard on yourself, okay? It's okay to take things at your own pace, and it's okay to prioritize your own mental health. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to connect. Take small steps, be kind to yourself, and see what happens.","

(got diagnosed w ADHD 3 weeks ago, in the diagnostic report my psychiatrist wrote that I present with mild anxiety, not a formal diagnosis though.)

I had an online tutorial for uni just a couple hours ago, and I had volunteered to share my thoughts on the topic. Tutor asked me to explain how I got to those findings, and I felt pretty stressed because that made me think that I'd gotten it all wrong. Before he asked me that I was speaking pretty well, but after I was stuttering a lot and couldn't organise my thoughts. I knew what words I wanted to say but I couldn't make a sentence from them in the moment. (Luckily, he seemed to understand what I was trying to say and agreed with me anyway).

I don't really know how to get around it. When it happens to me, like at work/ uni/ with friends/whatever, I usually just apologise to who I'm speaking to and try to think of the words I want without saying anything, like I'm doing a factory reset of myself.

I've experienced it too, especially when discussing sensitive or emotional topics. It's like my brain just goes into overload mode and words get jumbled up. I've found that taking a deep breath, counting to 10, or stepping away from the conversation for a sec can really help calm my nerves and get my thoughts together.

As for the trolls, honestly, who cares what they think? You're acknowledging and working on this, which is more than they can probably say. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize when we're struggling, so kudos to you for being honest with yourself.

It might be helpful to practice relaxation techniques, like meditation or journaling, to help manage stress and anxiety. And if you're feeling up to it, talking to a therapist could also be beneficial in addressing these feelings.

You're definitely not alone in this, and I'm glad you shared your experience. Thanks for being vulnerable and sparking this conversation!","

It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of 'Sunday blues,' but it's not just limited to Sundays ‚Äì it's more of an 'anyday blues' when you're thinking about going back to work.

Firstly, kudos to you for acknowledging your anxiety and getting diagnosed. That's a huge step towards taking control of your mental health.

I think your past experiences with difficult employers and colleagues might be contributing to this feeling of dread. It's possible that your brain is associating the thought of going back to work with those negative emotions.

Here's what might help: try to separate your current work situation from your past experiences. Remind yourself that things are different now, and you're in a better place. Additionally, establish a relaxing routine at home that signals to your brain that you're in a safe space. This could be something as simple as lighting a candle, reading a book, or practicing deep breathing exercises.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it's great that you're reaching out for support. You're not alone in this, and I'm sending you all the positive vibes.","

You know, I was just sitting here staring at my screen, getting worked up over some stressors, and I hadn't even realized I was holding my breath. Thanks for the nudge to take a moment for myself.

Taking a deep breath is one of those simple yet powerful tools we often overlook. It's amazing how much of a difference it can make in our mental and physical state. When we're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, our breathing tends to become shallow and rapid. By consciously taking a few deep breaths, we can calm our nervous system and bring ourselves back to the present moment.

So, thank you for sharing this reminder with us. I hope everyone reading this takes a moment to breathe deeply and appreciate the beauty of being alive.","

Firstly, know that you're not alone in this. Many people have unconscious habits that help them manage stress and anxiety. It's great that you've become more aware of your sighing, and acknowledging the cultural differences is a big step.

If you're finding it unbearable to stop sighing, try exploring other relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or short mindfulness meditation sessions. These might help reduce your anxiety and give you alternative ways to calm yourself down.

Remember, it's okay to take care of yourself, even if that means doing something that might be perceived as rude in certain cultures. Be patient with yourself, and maybe try explaining your situation to your Korean friends ‚Äì they might be more understanding than you think.","

One thing that might help is to try and separate the physical sensation from the anxiety it triggers. It's easy to get caught up in a cycle of stress and worry, but sometimes acknowledging that the fog is just a physical response to stress can help calm you down. I've found that mindfulness exercises and deep breathing can help me ground myself when I'm feeling 'out of it'.

Also, have you considered talking to a therapist about your experience? Sometimes just having someone to talk to who understands the physical aspects of anxiety can be really helpful. You're not alone in this, and there are people who get it.","

I cannot fix a chemical imbalance in my brain as easy as you fucking people make it sound like I can. Sometimes it gets bad enough to be seemingly out of my control. Your lack of good advice and your bullshit quick-fixes do not help at all.

First of all, let me just say that I believe you. I know what it's like to feel like your anxiety is out of control, and it's infuriating when people don't get it. It's not just about 'telling yourself you're fine' or 'exercising it away.' Chemical imbalances are real, and they can't be fixed with a quick fix or a magic solution.

If you don't mind me saying so, it sounds like you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

There's just something about retreating to the comfort of your bed when life gets overwhelming. It's like your body's way of saying, ""Hey, I need a break from all this stress.""

I've been there too, especially when I have to face a long day of social interactions or tasks that feel daunting. My bed becomes my safe haven, where I can just curl up and escape from it all.

Here's the thing: it's okay to take a break and prioritize your self-care. Instead of beating yourself up over not being productive, try to see it as a chance to recharge. Set a timer for 30 minutes or an hour, and give yourself permission to relax. Watch that show, read a book, or simply snooze. When you're feeling more centered, you can get back to tackling those tasks.

Remember, taking care of yourself is not selfish ‚Äì it's essential. So, go ahead and indulge in that cozy bed time. Your body (and mind) will thank you.","

First off, just know that you're not alone in this. It's normal to have those 'what was I thinking?' moments, especially when we're reflecting on interactions at work or with people we respect (like your boss).

Rather than beating yourself up over it, try to reframe those nighttime reflections as opportunities for growth and self-awareness. Ask yourself what you could do differently in the future, and what you can learn from the experience.

And remember, people are often more focused on their own stuff than they are on judging us. So, it's likely your boss didn't even give it a second thought. Be kind to yourself, and try to let go of those pesky what-ifs.","

Been dealing with my mentally ill, alcoholic mom for over a month. I haven't had a really nice, normal poop in awhile.",26,Sterngirl,"Hey there, I totally feel you. I've been there too, and it's super frustrating when anxiety decides to wreak havoc on your digestive system at the worst possible times. I'm not a doctor, but from what I've read and experienced, it's pretty common for people with anxiety to have gastrointestinal issues due to the gut-brain connection.

One thing that's helped me is deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. When I start to feel that stomach unease, I try to take a few minutes to breathe deeply and focus on relaxing my muscles. It can help calm down your nervous system and, in turn, your digestive system. It's not a magic fix, but it's worth a shot.

It's also good to know you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be a real pain (literally), but knowing there are others who get it can make it a bit more manageable. If you don't mind me asking, have you talked to a doctor or therapist about your anxiety? They might be able to offer some more tailored advice or support. Hang in there, and remember you're not alone in this.","

It's frustrating when tech issues ruin what's supposed to be a valuable experience, especially when it comes to something as important as therapy. I can imagine how disheartening it must be to finally find a therapist after a year-long wait, only to have the session fall apart due to a bad connection.

Firstly, don't hesitate to reach out to your therapist and explain the situation. They might be willing to offer a makeup session or a refund, considering the circumstances. It's also essential to discuss how you can improve the connection for future sessions.

In the meantime, consider talking to your therapist about exploring alternative platforms or tools that might work better for you both. Some therapists might be open to using different video conferencing software or even switching to in-person sessions if possible.

Remember, this isn't a reflection of your worth or the value of therapy. It's just a technical glitch. Don't give up ‚Äì you've come too far, and you deserve to get the help and support you need.","

It's like your brain is a browser with too many tabs open, and suddenly, one of those old, dusty tabs from years ago pops back up. It can be really frustrating and disorienting.

I think it's actually pretty common for our brains to revisit past experiences, especially if they were traumatic or emotionally significant. It's like our minds are trying to process and make sense of what happened, even years after the fact.

One thing that might help is to acknowledge these thoughts when they come up, but try not to get too caught up in them. Remind yourself that you're safe now, and that these thoughts are just memories. It might also be helpful to practice some self-care and grounding techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help calm your mind and bring you back to the present.

Remember, you're not alone in this. It's okay to have these thoughts, and it doesn't mean you're stuck in the past. You're just doing some mental maintenance, and that's a normal part of healing and growth.","

Your advice to take a break from the news is spot on. Sometimes, it's necessary to step back and focus on things that bring us joy and calmness. It's easy to get sucked into the 24-hour news cycle, but it's not healthy.

Remember, the outcome of the election will be what it will be. Instead of stressing about it, try to focus on the things you can control, like staying informed, exercising your right to vote (if you're eligible), and engaging in respectful conversations with others.

I admire your courage in speaking out about your experience and I'm glad to hear that quitting caffeine has had such a positive impact on your life. If anyone's considering stopping, I'd say start by gradually reducing your intake - it's not easy to go cold turkey, but it's worth it.

I think it's essential to acknowledge that feeling awkward or uncomfortable can be a sign that we're pushing ourselves outside our comfort zones, and that's exactly where the magic happens. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we need to be perfect or have it all figured out, but the truth is, nobody does.

To anyone who's feeling discouraged or uncertain today, I want to echo the OP's sentiments - don't give up. Those little victories, even if they feel insignificant now, will add up over time. And remember, it's okay to stumble and make mistakes - it's all part of the learning process.

Thanks for the reminder, OP. You're helping people feel seen and heard today, and that's a beautiful thing.","

pjv423,Anxiety,does anyone else adore the rain?,Unfair_Narwhal5135,"I have no idea why, but when it rains or when it storms it gives me so much peace of mind. it helps me for some reason and it eases my body and it allows me to relax therefore easing my anxiety symptoms. it‚Äôs raining right now and I feel so care free and good I‚Äôm not sure why. does anyone else feel this. I get so happy when it rains and i100% prefer it over a sunny day.",1186,153,1631046096,"Completely agree. It's super relaxing and really helps me focus. Last night I put on a video game song that plays when it rains in-game, added rain sound effects behind it and just felt really good.

Edit: [Here is the song](https://youtu.be/lTKrmuU0C3s)",92,Leonhart_13,,0,,"I completely get it. I've always found rain to be calming, too. There's something about the sound of the droplets on the roof or against the window that's just so soothing. I think it's great that you've found something that helps ease your anxiety symptoms.

For me, I think the rain helps to create a sense of coziness and intimacy. It's like the whole world outside is muffled, and all that's left is the present moment. Plus, there's something about the smell of wet earth and leaves that's just so grounding.

If you don't mind me asking, have you ever tried incorporating rain sounds into your daily routine when it's not actually raining outside? There are tons of apps and YouTube videos that can create a similar atmosphere. It might be a helpful tool for managing anxiety on sunny days. Anyway, glad to hear you're enjoying the rain today!","

amqy1o,Anxiety,Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.,quietwreck,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy. I‚Äôm allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. ",1276,60,1549210597,"It sounds like you have really sorted your life out. Well done, that's awesome. ",65,katiefeatherstone,"It sounds like you have really sorted your life out. Well done, that's awesome. ",65,katiefeatherstone,"Wow, I can really relate to what you're saying. It's like your brain is so used to being in 'survival mode' that when you start feeling emotions that aren't anxiety or stress, it throws you off completely. I've been there too, where I've felt like I'm 'losing it' because I'm experiencing happiness or excitement for an extended period.

First of all, huge congrats on quitting that toxic job and taking care of yourself. That takes a lot of courage.

I think it's really insightful of you to recognize that your brain is just not used to handling emotions like happiness and confidence, and that it's a common thing for people with anxiety disorders. It's like your brain is trying to 'catch up' with all these new emotions and it can feel overwhelming.

Just remember that it's okay to feel happy, angry, or any other emotion, and it doesn't mean you're going crazy. You've done so much work with CBT and it's great that you're recognizing your progress. Keep being kind to yourself and reminding yourself that you're allowed to feel all these emotions. You're doing great!","

r23gzk,Anxiety,Do you ever just wear yourself out with your own thoughts?,Salt-Seaworthiness91,I feel so tired,1219,115,1637866127,Every second of every day. So many voices. üòì,153,howboutnoskott,,0,,"I totally get it, and I think we've all been there at some point. It's like your mind becomes a never-ending loop of thoughts, worries, and what-ifs, leaving you feeling drained and exhausted.

Firstly, just acknowledging that your thoughts can be overwhelming is a huge step. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so kudos to you for sharing this.

When I'm feeling like this, I try to take a step back and remind myself that my thoughts aren't always facts. It's easy to get caught up in negative self-talk or catastrophic thinking, but it's not always based in reality.

If you feel like you're in a thought loop, try taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or engaging in an activity that requires your full attention (like a puzzle or a creative project). Sometimes, a change of scenery or a distraction can help calm your mind and give you a fresh perspective.

Remember, you're not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to take a break from your thoughts. Be kind to yourself, and take care of your mental health.","

mm8sxb,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel most of their anxiety would dissipate if society would just lay off?,ae516,The majority of my anxiety is driven by societal expectations. I don't have a license because I hate driving...an expectation that didn't even exist before the 1900s. I hated school and struggle with work because I constantly feel I'm not smart enough for the task. I hate money and insurance because I never have enough. I hate appointments and social gatherings because people expect me to appear normal and put-together. I hate this century because I feel like a wild animal that is expected to pay taxes instead of thriving in nature and foraging for food.,1202,132,1617820766,"YES.  My anxiety is very work related.  The pressure to be an extremely hard worker with some hot career is such bullshit to me.  I always have a ton of shame associated with my lack of a career, work ethic and having no money.  I wish it were okay to admit that some people (me) are just not suitable for hard work and that should be okay.  And it's even more ridiculous that it's near impossible to live comfortably in America if you're not working your ass off...it fucking sucks!!!",231,reluctant_spinster,"100% felt this post. I know there is no set timeline for life but I feel like I‚Äôve failed. I‚Äôm 30 this year and feel like I‚Äôm still in what most consider a first job, and as a result I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm earning enough or I‚Äôm in the right place for it. I also don‚Äôt have a license, I did learn for quite a while a few years back but the anxiety of it crippled me so I stopped and honestly I‚Äôm happier for it. I just feel like I should be able to drive by my age and should be able to afford my own home and nonsense like that üò©",67,Bilbo_Buggin,"I completely get where you're coming from. It's like society has this unspoken expectation that we all have to fit into this narrow mold, and if we don't, we're somehow failing. I think it's amazing that you're recognizing the root of your anxiety and willing to challenge those expectations.

I want to suggest that it's okay to not conform to societal norms. It's okay to not have a license, to not love your job, or to struggle with finances. It's okay to be different. In fact, it's more than okay ‚Äì it's necessary for a healthy and happy life.

It might be helpful to try to reframe your thinking around these expectations. Instead of feeling like you're not good enough, try to see them as societal pressures that don't necessarily align with your values. You have the power to create your own path and define what success means to you.

Remember, you're not alone in this feeling. There are plenty of people out there who feel the same way, and there's a growing movement towards simplicity, minimalism, and living outside the norm. You do you, and don't let societal expectations dictate your happiness.","

It's like my brain just goes on autopilot and my mouth starts doing its own thing. I've tried a few things to help break the habit, and one thing that's worked for me is being more mindful of my body language and physical sensations when I'm feeling anxious. When I catch myself tensing up or feeling my jaw clench, I take a deep breath and try to relax. It's not a magic fix, but it's helped me become more aware of when I'm about to start biting.

Another thing that's helped me is chewing gum or eating sunflower seeds when I'm feeling anxious - it gives my mouth something to do besides biting my cheeks. I've also tried using a stress ball or fidget toy to channel my anxiety into something more productive.

Hang in there, and don't worry - you're definitely not alone in this!","

It feels like you're just going through the motions, and the daily grind is taking a toll on your mental and physical health. I've been there too, and it's exhausting.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle to find meaning and purpose in their daily lives. It's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay and that it's time to make some changes.

One thing that might help is to identify what's causing this feeling of burnout. Is it the job itself, or is it the work-life balance? Once you pinpoint the issue, you can start exploring ways to address it. Maybe it's time to look for a new job, or perhaps it's about setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care.

Remember, taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary. Start small by doing things that bring you joy, even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day. Whether it's reading, drawing, or taking a walk, make time for it. You deserve to live a life that's more than just surviving.","

Then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated lol.

First off, just want to say that it's great you're acknowledging the connection between your anxiety and stomach aches. That's already a huge step forward. For me, deep breathing exercises and meditation have been lifesavers when it comes to calming my anxiety and, in turn, my stomach. Have you tried any relaxation techniques like that?

It might also be worth looking into some gut-friendly foods and drinks to see if that helps alleviate the stomach cramps. Ginger tea or peppermint oil, for example, can be really soothing. And hey, if it's constipation, well, at least that's an easy fix.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's totally okay to feel overwhelmed. Take care of yourself, and try to focus on one thing at a time. Hope you start feeling better soon","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else's stomach get messed up by anxiety?

POST BODY: I've been crazy stressed this week and have been getting a lot of stomach aches. Then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated lol. Though I'm more inclined to say it's anxiety because the pain seems to vanish the moment I stop feeling anxious, and then comes back when I start thinking about it again. No fun :(

zl1gsv,Anxiety,My bf asked me what my social anxiety is like and this is what I sent him.,cw9241,"When in a social situation, I struggle with constant thoughts akin to this:

‚ÄúWhat do I say now? Do I laugh here? Was I not supposed to laugh at that? Omg, I just laughed at that and they were serious and now I gotta fix it. Make this joke. No, dont. You know what, it‚Äôs a funny joke. I shouldn‚Äôt have made that joke. They‚Äôre not laughing. I knew that was a stupid joke to make. They think I‚Äôm stupid. Yikes. I wonder if they‚Äôre looking at my teeth. Do they notice my crooked smile? Smile less. I look unfriendly, smile more. I probably look really stupid smiling and nodding so much. Say something. Say something! I‚Äôve literally been laughing this whole time and haven‚Äôt said a single thing except that really dumb joke I made earlier. They think I‚Äôm an airhead. They don‚Äôt like me. I wonder if that compliment they just gave me was them just being nice. Smile and say thank you. Change the subject. Wait! I forgot to compliment them back. I messed up. They hate me. Try again tomorrow.‚Äù

Does this resonate with anyone else here?",1217,106,1670952710,Yup. And then go home and relive the entire thing over and over as you analyze each moment.,569,Repulsive_Fondant_26,"No, this post is 100% insecurity.  Re read the post. Everything is geared towards I, I, I.  A fear of judgment, and desire to be noticed in a positive light.

If this person had anxiety she'd be overwhelmed by the future and not the present.  Her post ebbs and flows into a cross between depression (putting herself down for past behavior) and anxiety (thinking about what she should do), further demonstrating her insecurities. 

I doubt people with high anxiety have appropriate responses to realistic threats.  Those mother fuckers freeze or run.  I see it all the time in real life.",-1,MonkMode2019,"Oh my god, this resonates with me so much. I'm impressed that you were able to articulate your thoughts like that - it can be really hard to put into words. I think what you're describing is a classic case of ""analysis paralysis"" - you're overthinking every little thing, which can be super overwhelming.

One thing that's helped me in similar situations is to take a step back and remind myself that nobody is paying as much attention to me as I think they are. Most people are too caught up in their own thoughts and worries to be judging me as harshly as I'm judging myself. It might sound simple, but it can really help to reframe your thinking.

Also, it's amazing that your boyfriend asked you to explain your social anxiety to him - that takes a lot of courage and empathy. I'm sure it means a lot to him that you were willing to be so open and honest with him. Keep talking to him about how you're feeling, and I'm sure he'll be there to support you.","

It's so easy to get caught up in our own negative self-talk and forget that we're not alone, and that we're capable of so much.

I think what's really important to remember is that everyone has bad days, and it's okay to not be okay. It doesn't make you a failure or a waste of space. It just means you're human, and that's something to be proud of.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, I encourage you to take a step back, breathe, and focus on the present moment. Break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments. And most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Thanks again for sharing this reminder. It really made my day.","

f2ej20,Anxiety,Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,efarley1,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",1227,93,1581453318,YAY!,36,captain_paws_tattoo,Congratulations,15,Jacek310,"""Huge congratulations to you on passing your driver's test! I can only imagine how nerve-wracking it must have been, especially considering you almost didn't go through with it. It's amazing that you pushed through your doubts and came out on top.

I love the advice you're sharing with others who might be in a similar situation. I think it's especially helpful that you mention knowing the car's features and paying attention to road signs - those are often overlooked details that can make a big difference.

What I think is even more inspiring, though, is the fact that you're sharing your experience and encouraging others to take the leap. It's not always easy to be vulnerable and open about our struggles, but it's clear that you're coming from a place of kindness and empathy. Thanks for being a great role model, and I hope you enjoy the freedom that comes with having your driver's license!""","

Sometimes just acknowledging that we're trying is a huge accomplishment in itself.

Remember, success isn't just about the end result; it's about the journey, the growth, and the lessons learned along the way. Every effort you put in, every obstacle you overcome, and every setback you bounce back from is a testament to your strength and resilience.

Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't work out as planned. Instead, focus on the progress you're making, no matter how small it may seem. Celebrate your tiny wins, and use them as motivation to keep pushing forward.

You're not alone in this, and there are people who believe in you, even if it's just strangers on the internet like me. Keep trying, and know that every effort counts.","

It's like you're trying to stall the inevitable, and the thought of facing the next day is just too overwhelming. I've been there too, staying up late not because I couldn't sleep, but because I just didn't want the day to start yet.

Here's the thing: it's not about being productive or getting stuff done; it's about avoiding the anxiety that comes with the next day. I've found that addressing the root cause of that anxiety can help. What is it about the next day that's making you nervous? Is it work, school, or something else?

Try breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and prioritize them. Sometimes, having a clear plan can help you feel more in control and prepared for the next day. Also, set a realistic bedtime routine, and try to stick to it. It might not be easy, but it's worth a shot.

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Just take things one step at a time, and remember that you can handle whatever comes next.","

One thing that might help is to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past.

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

Going over it in your head can be therapeutic to an extent, but thinking about explaining your position and actually doing it are as different as thinking about your favourite food and eating it; both are good feelings but only one will actually help you out. So my advice would be not to worry about it or be ashamed of it- what you‚Äôre doing is perfectly normal, but at the same time if you want to really put your views out there then don‚Äôt be satisfied with your current habits because they won‚Äôt get you where you want to be.

I've definitely been there too - replaying conversations in my head, thinking about what I should've said, and feeling like I'm walking on eggshells around others.

Firstly, know that it's okay to have boundaries and express yourself. It's not about being confrontational, but about being honest and authentic. It might help to practice assertive communication in low-stakes situations, like with a trusted friend or family member. This can help you build confidence in expressing your thoughts and feelings without being aggressive or passive.

It's also important to remember that you can't control how others react, but you can control how you respond to them. If someone does get upset or defensive, it's not necessarily about you - it's about their own emotions and reactions. You deserve to be heard and respected, and it's okay to stand up for yourself.","

For me, self-care is all about finding small, manageable tasks that help me build momentum. Sometimes, it's as simple as making a cup of coffee or taking a short walk around the block. I also try to be kind to myself and acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay. Anxiety can be a real challenge, and it's amazing that you're recognizing what you need to get through the day.

POST BODY: I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs more than ok to start your day later. Some days are like that. It‚Äôs hard to find motivation especially when the anxiety is really bad. So do something you enjoy first. Like self care. My self care today is ice cream and going to a park and reading a book. Yay for getting dressed and getting out of the house despite dreading it. It wasn‚Äôt so bad and now I will do dishes, pat myself on the back, and call it a productive day so I can go binge watch a show. What do you guys do for self care or to get yourself moving on harder days? I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Sending good vibes!


EDIT: I don‚Äôt know how edits work I guess I just write in here? Thank you so so much for everyone who interacted with this post and shared their story. This is a wonderful community and you‚Äôre all doing great! And thank you so so much for the award.

That no one should have anxiety because it's difficult and hard. That no person on planet earth deserves Anxiety or Depression!,1222,94,1606145450,YELL IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK,108,championofthelight,Anyone else scrolling through this post smiling and feeling like someone is talking to you?,8,Rmi93,"I completely get where you're coming from - anxiety can be absolutely suffocating. I've been there too, and it's amazing how it can make you feel like you're the only one struggling, even when in reality, there are so many of us fighting the same battles.

Your message is so important, and I'm glad you're using your platform to spread awareness and support. One thing that's helped me (and might help others) is recognizing that anxiety isn't a personal failing, but rather a sign that our minds and bodies need a little extra care.

It's okay to not be okay, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging that no one deserves to suffer through anxiety or depression. If you're comfortable, I'd love to hear more about what you do to cope with anxiety - sharing our strategies and experiences can be so powerful in helping others feel less alone. Keep spreading the love and support, and thanks for being a voice for those who might not have the words to express themselves.","

It's like you're in a state of calm, and then your brain suddenly checks in and says, ""Hey, you're feeling good. That's weird. Something must be wrong."" And just like that, the anxiety kicks in.

I've experienced this too, and it can be really frustrating. But here's the thing: it's normal. Our brains are wired to look for potential threats, even when there aren't any. It's like your brain is trying to anticipate problems before they happen.

One thing that might help is to try to catch yourself when you start thinking about thinking (if that makes sense). When you notice yourself saying, ""Wait, I'm feeling good. That's weird,"" try to redirect your thoughts to the present moment. Focus on your breath, your surroundings, or whatever you're doing. Don't try to analyze your feelings or worry about what might happen next. Just be. It's not always easy, but it can help calm your mind and break the anxiety loop. Hang in there, and remember you're not alone in this.","

And all you're trying to do is be kind, be funny, express your love, try and be loved back.

I've been there too, and it's this crushing sense of ""am I really that annoying?"" that can be really hard to shake off.

First of all, let's consider that people often have their own stuff going on, and their reactions to us might not always be about us, but about themselves. It's possible that they're stressed, overwhelmed, or dealing with their own insecurities, and that's not a reflection of your worth as a person.

That being said, it's also important to recognize that we can't control how others perceive us, but we can control how we show up in the world. Instead of focusing on trying to be liked by everyone, try to focus on being true to yourself. Be kind, be funny, express your love ‚Äì not to get validation from others, but because that's who you are. And when you do find those people who appreciate you for who you are, that's when the magic happens. You're not alone in this feeling, and I'm sending you a big virtual hug.","

I know what you're going through.",58,triggafish,Congrats!,31,a_million_days,"""Huge congratulations to you on passing your permit test with flying colors. That's amazing dedication and a great start to your driving journey.

I totally get it, taking the leap to get your permit can be intimidating, especially if you're a bit older than your peers when they started learning. But it just goes to show that it's never too late to start, and you're already crushing it.

As you start practicing, remember to take it one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you stall the car or make a mistake - it's all part of the learning process. Find a patient instructor or practice buddy, and take advantage of open roads or quiet parking lots to get comfortable behind the wheel.

You got this, and before you know it, you'll be driving solo in no time. Keep us posted on your progress, and enjoy the ride (pun intended)!""","

9hv1q9,Anxiety,"I am incredibly lonely all the time, but I feel so relieved when I don‚Äôt have to be around ppl. Anybody else experience something similar?",futurefiction2,"Edit:I‚Äôm not sure if anyone will see this edit, but thank you all for commenting on this post. Reading all your comments has been comforting, but also heartbreaking knowing there are so many of us that struggle with something that seems so simple(being around other humans) I went to bed last night feeling very defeated as I gave into my anxiety yet again and bailed on a social event to stay home and be alone. However, I woke up this morning to see all these responses and they honestly made me emotional because now I see so many people struggling with this same thing! There is probably ppl even in my own apartment building that feel this way and I can‚Äôt reach them! I can‚Äôt find them because of my anxiety holding me back. This viscous cycle has to be broken.... We are weakest alone. We need each other. We can not accept isolation. ",1223,92,1537571877,"Yes. This is actually pretty common. 

If you‚Äôre like me, being around others can make you nervous, unless they‚Äôre very close to you. It takes a lot of energy to keep up acceptable social interaction.

If you‚Äôre comfortable talking about your anxiety, it can be surprisingly helpful to tell people you trust about this. It lessens the chance of hurt feelings, and it can be incredibly reassuring to have a friend look after your well-being. 

There are a few people these days that will ask where my energy is at before going out, and will offer to leave with me if I need to. That assurance alone is often enough to make me feel more relaxed.

You‚Äôre not broken. Your energy just has different parameters. Being social is draining.

It helps to practice. Eventually, you‚Äôll find a method hat works for you. Just don‚Äôt give up.",284,TheFunbag,"I, too, experience this and it‚Äôs so conflicting!

It's like your brain is constantly torn between the desire for connection and the overwhelming fear of being around people. I've been there too, and it's a really tough spot to be in.

First of all, I want you to know that you're not alone (no pun intended). It's amazing how many people are struggling with this, and it's heartbreaking that we often feel like we're the only ones.

One thing that helped me was to start small. Instead of trying to tackle big social events, I started with tiny, low-stakes interactions, like chatting with a cashier or saying hello to a neighbor. It sounds silly, but it helped me build up my confidence.

Also, have you considered joining online communities or forums for people with social anxiety? It can be really helpful to connect with others who get it, and it might be a more comfortable way for you to start building connections.

Remember, you're not weak for feeling this way, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. You're taking the first step by acknowledging your feelings and seeking support, and that's something to be proud of.","

It's absolutely unacceptable for someone to treat you like that, especially in a public place where you're just trying to get some food. It's not just the comments themselves, but the fact that she continued to belittle you for 15 minutes straight - that's just cruel.

First of all, please know that her behavior says way more about her than it does about you. People who feel the need to tear others down often do so to make themselves feel better. It's not about you; it's about her own insecurities.

It's understandable that you're feeling small and worthless right now, but please don't let her words define you. You are so much more than what she said. Your worth and confidence come from within, and it's okay to take time to rebuild them. Consider talking to a friend, family member, or therapist about what happened - sometimes just sharing your experience with someone who cares about you can help you regain your confidence.

Remember, you are not alone, and you are not defined by one stranger's cruel words.","

iicu6b,Anxiety,Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry?,lezedi,"I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven‚Äôt heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here. Is this an anxiety disorder thing? Do other people experience this? Or am I just weird? :/

I've always attributed it to my anxiety, too. One thing that might help you is to recognize that your reaction is rooted in a desire to self-preserve - your brain is trying to protect you from potential harm. It's like your fight-or-flight response is triggered by what you perceive as a threat, even if it's not necessarily directed at you.

One strategy that's helped me is to take a step back, breathe, and remind myself that the other person's emotions aren't my responsibility. I try to focus on my own feelings and well-being, rather than getting caught up in theirs. It's also helpful to have a few grounding techniques up your sleeve, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or a quick walk outside.

You're definitely not alone in this, and it's amazing that your post has resonated with so many people. Keep in mind that it's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't make you weird - it just means you're highly attuned to the emotions of those around you.","

Also with my emet i dont have and never have had the ability to burp which apparently is pretty common among emets and causes so much nausea and discomfort.There is a sub called r/noburp which is also a great community- if it applies!",32,therockhuntress,"I totally feel you - I've had anxiety-related stomach issues for years, and it's a vicious cycle. The more I worry about getting sick, the more my stomach freaks out, and it's like my brain is basically telling my gut, 'Hey, let's make this anxiety thing a self-fulfilling prophecy.' 

I've found that deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation really help calm my stomach and brain. It's not a magic cure, but it's helped me learn to manage my anxiety a bit better. Also, have you considered talking to a therapist about your emetophobia? Exposure therapy can be super effective in helping people overcome their fears, and it might be worth exploring.

It's also worth noting that your body is just responding to the stress signals your brain is sending out - it's not a personal failing or anything to be ashamed of. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to reach out for support. Hang in there, and don't be afraid to seek help when you need it.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get stomach pains and diarrhea with their anxiety?

POST BODY: My anxiety is partly linked to my extreme emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and for those of you who don't know about it, it ruins every aspect of my life, to the point where if I get the slightest stomach pain or uncomfortable feeling ill panic, which results in me having stomach pains all the time, and sometimes, maybe once a month or so I'll come across feeling awful, with crippling stomach pains and end up on the toilet for half an hour with poop coming out like a faucet, does anyone else experience diarrhea along with their anxiety? It really sucks

It's like our minds have this superpower to connect dots and conclude we're complete failures. But here's the thing: that's not reality, it's just our brain's way of trying to make sense of things.

One thing that helps me is to acknowledge those thoughts and let them pass. It's like, 'Hey, I see you, Negative Nancy, but I'm not going to engage with you right now.' I also remind myself that I'm not alone in this, and that everyone has those days (clearly, judging by all the awesome comments on this post!).

When you're feeling down, try to focus on the present moment and do something that brings you comfort ‚Äì whether it's taking a warm bath, reading a book, or going for a walk. And hey, getting out of bed this morning was a win, so keep building on that momentum! You got this, and remember, you're not defined by one bad day (or one bad thought).","

You did what you needed to do, and that's something to be proud of.

Removing the booze from the equation is a great goal, though. Maybe try to identify what specifically made you anxious about making those appointments, and see if you can find alternative coping mechanisms. For me, it's usually about breaking tasks down into smaller, manageable chunks, and rewarding myself afterwards. But everyone's different, so experiment and find what works for you.

You got this, and we're all rooting for you. Remember, small victories are still victories, and they can add up to make a big difference in the long run. Keep sharing your progress and celebrate those wins - we're happy to celebrate with you!""","

n6kr5j,Anxiety,My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,pain_in_the-anus,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference",1219,87,1620343509,Thanks for this tip!!! I bet it takes some getting used to?

I‚Äôll remember this. ü•∞,114,bluebearymuffin_,"I totally get it - I've been there too with anxiety and overthinking. It's amazing how simple yet powerful that trick is. 'Just make up your mind' sounds easy, but it's actually really hard to break the cycle of rumination. I love how you framed it as 'trust yourself.' That's a huge part of it - trusting that you've thought it through and made the best decision you can.

One thing that has helped me in addition to this trick is setting a 'worry deadline.' I give myself a certain amount of time to think about something, and after that, I have to let it go. It's helped me avoid getting sucked into the vortex of overthinking.

Thanks for sharing this trick with us - it's definitely something that can make a big difference for people struggling with anxiety. You're not alone, and it's awesome that you're finding ways to manage your GAD and phobias. Keep spreading the hope and support!","

gg45u4,Anxiety,Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,AromaticPigeon,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)",1110,196,1588980321,I do this when I go to sleep cause I start thinking too much before bed.

I've been doing the same thing for years to cope with my anxiety. Having a familiar show playing in the background creates a sense of comfort and normalcy for me. I've found that it's not just the noise that helps, but also the predictability of the show. Knowing what's going to happen next can be really reassuring.

As for potential negative effects, I'd say it's unlikely to cause harm if the volume is low and you're not relying on it as an avoidance strategy. It's more about finding a coping mechanism that works for you. That being said, it's always a good idea to take breaks and practice mindfulness or self-care activities to help manage anxiety in the long run.

I'm a big fan of rewatching old favorites too! Currently, I've been playing The Office and Parks and Rec on repeat. It's amazing how many of us share this experience, and I'm glad you feel less alone now. Keep doing what works for you, and remember that it's okay to prioritize your mental health.","

I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I‚Äôm grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people‚Äôs energy.

Yeah, this is the worst I've been in a long time. I want to puke and cry every morning and then when I try to analyse my life, I come to the conclusion that my life really isn't that bad and somehow that just makes it worse!

I hate this. I'm genuinely terrified that this will be me forever and I don't know how much more I can take.",205,Irishane,"Yes! Eating to passify my anxiety has been a major feature for me. I think that's quite a common thing and I'd bet loads of people who do it don't connect it to anxiety.   
But thankfully I've been kicking anxietys ass lately.   
CBD oil works for me to reduce my anxiety levels, or maybe that's wrong, it's more like ""muffle"" it, the anxiety is still there but I can't feel most of it. Then I started thinking that my gut bacteria had something to do with my anxiety, so I started drinking probiotic yoghurt which seemed to help a little.  Then one day I was listening to the Blindboy Podcast and he was talking about kambucha as a source of good bacteria, O. M. G. I tried it, and what a difference! Unlike the CBD, I feel the kambucha is actually helping reduce my anxiety, rather than just dulling it. I've only drank it 3 times in the past week, but I've seen a really big difference, I've halved the amount of CBD oil I've been taking and I'm able to exercise more. I'm quietly confident.     
So, given food calms your anxiety, try working to fix your gut bacteria and see if that helps.      
   
Edit: i also stopped drinking alcohol completely which was a great help, and I'm limited to 1 coffee a day.",2,bot_bot_bot,"I feel you so deeply, OP. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time with your anxiety, and I'm sending you all the virtual hugs. As someone who's also highly sensitive, I can relate to the overwhelm of taking on other people's energy. It's like having your emotional antennae always on high alert, and it's exhausting.

First of all, please know that you're not alone in this. Many of us are struggling, and it's okay to not be okay. I want to suggest that you keep doing the things that feel safe and comforting to you - like cooking, staying in, and enjoying sunny days. Those small joys can be a great source of strength.

Regarding eating your anxiety, it's definitely a thing (hello, comfort food!). But maybe try exploring some more mindful eating habits to see if that helps you cope. And to answer your second edit, I don't think you're being too sensitive - I think you're just more attuned to the world around you. That's a gift, and it's okay to acknowledge it. Keep prioritizing your self-care, and remember that we're all here to support you.","

It's amazing to see how you turned things around after a tough experience last week. I completely understand the grip of anxiety, especially in high-pressure situations like interviews. It's incredible that you were able to shift your approach and have fun with it this time around.

I think that's a great lesson for all of us - sometimes, all it takes is a change in perspective to break free from anxiety's hold. Your 'fake it till you make it' approach clearly worked, and it's wonderful that you got to showcase your true personality.

Starting a new job can be daunting, but it sounds like you're going into it with a positive attitude and a sense of confidence. Remember to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. You got this! Enjoy your new adventure working with those adorable dogs, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support along the way.""","

When your anxious, your mind thinks the worst possible scenario, not the most REALISTIC scenario. The worst possible scenario could have a &lt;1% chance of being true but it doesn‚Äôt feel like that in the state of anxiousness.

It‚Äôs a trap, it feels like you‚Äôre gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you‚Äôre stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Again, you‚Äôre thinking about the most unlikely, worst case scenario. No, you‚Äôre not going to go crazy, you aren‚Äôt gonna have a heart attack, your life isn‚Äôt ruined forever, you‚Äôre intrusive thoughts won‚Äôt clog your mind forever.

It‚Äôs just that &lt;1% that keeps prying open the lid.,66,[deleted],"I totally get where you're coming from, and I'm so glad you're sharing this with us, even if it's scary. It's like you're giving us a gift by being vulnerable and honest about your anxiety.

I've been there too, and it's crazy how our minds can convince us that the worst-case scenario is the only possible outcome. But like you said, it's not about ignoring those thoughts or telling ourselves they're not real - it's about acknowledging them and reminding ourselves that they're not the only possibility.

One thing that's helped me is to reframe those thoughts by asking myself, ""Is this thought based on facts or feelings?"" It sounds simple, but it helps me take a step back and separate reality from anxiety-fueled catastrophizing.

Thanks for the reminder, and don't delete this post! You're helping more people than you know, and that's something to be proud of. Keep putting in the effort, and know that you're not alone in this.","

dtd0fi,Anxiety,I get anxious because I feel like no matter what I do I could be doing something better with my time so I end up doing nothing at all,siwel7,"Literally, nothing. Reddit, ring a few friends, rarely go out and I'm unemployed. I'm 30 and I feel like a piece of garbage",1217,84,1573205220,"I hear you. I'll want to play a video game, or watch a show on Netflix, but then my brain goes down the rabbit hole of, ""Well I could be doing this, this, and this, which are way more productive."" This happens even if there are no chores left to do in the house. This thought process basically paralyzes me in my chair, and I end up scrolling through Reddit for hours instead of doing things I actually want to do. 

In the meantime my husband will be right next to me at his desk happily playing video games without a care in the world. I really envy him sometimes for being able to come home, sit down, and just *do whatever the fuck he wants.* It kills me when I accomplish absolutely nothing in a day. It leaves me with no goals, no enjoyement, and is just slowly killing me. This bizarre fear of wasting time just results in wasted time.",213,Bipolar_Pigeon,...ADHD?,4,pickledonionfish,"I totally get it. That feeling of perpetual indecision and FOMO (fear of missing out) can be paralyzing. It's like you're stuck in an infinite loop of ""should I be doing this or that?"" and it's hard to make a move.

First off, let's acknowledge that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with the fear of not making the most of their time. And it's not necessarily about being lazy or unmotivated ‚Äì it's often about being overwhelmed by the possibilities.

Here's what might help: try to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about the 'what ifs'. Take small, manageable steps towards things that genuinely interest you. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to make the 'perfect' choice ‚Äì just take action.

Also, consider seeking out people who can support and encourage you, whether that's friends, family, or a therapist. Having a network of people who believe in you can make a huge difference.

Lastly, try to be kind to yourself. You're 30, and that's not old. You've got time to figure things out, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","

He was just hiding in a different closet than usual. üòë My brain goes from 0-100 in a blink of an eye...,169,bellitabee,"&gt;The fact that it is always on in the background drives me nuts.

It gets so frustrating sometimes....",54,asyrewicze,"I can totally relate to this scenario. It's like our brains are wired to catastrophize the smallest details and create these worst-case scenarios. I've been there too, where one tiny thing sets off a chain reaction of panic and anxiety.

One thing that's helped me is to acknowledge when I'm jumping to conclusions and try to take a step back. It's not always easy, but it's helpful to remind myself that my brain is just trying to protect me, even if it's being a bit overzealous.

In your case, it might be helpful to have a pre-emptive conversation with your mom about how you're feeling. Let her know that you tend to get anxious when you can't reach her right away, and ask if she can maybe send a quick ""all good"" text or something when she's busy. It might help you feel more at ease and reduce those frantic phone calls.

Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this.","

I've been there too, where the silence feels deafening and my mind starts racing with anxious thoughts. I've found that background noise can be a really effective coping mechanism for managing those feelings of overwhelm. It's almost like the noise gives your brain something else to focus on, so it's not stuck in that endless loop of worry and self-doubt.

One thing that might be worth exploring is the idea of ""grounding techniques"" - these are strategies that can help you stay present in the moment and distract yourself from anxious thoughts. Things like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or even just paying attention to your five senses can be really helpful. You might find that, over time, you're able to rely less on background noise and more on these internal coping mechanisms. But hey, if the noise is working for you, that's totally okay too! Just wanted to offer a suggestion, and let you know you're not alone in this struggle.","

I had a similar experience during quarantine, my anxiety spiked, and I found myself overthinking and catastrophizing everything. It's like being stuck inside physically amplified all the fears and worries we already had.

Firstly, please know you're not alone in this. Many people have reported worsening anxiety during quarantine. It's essential to acknowledge that this is a tough time, and it's okay to struggle.

One thing that helped me was establishing a daily routine, even if it was just small tasks like taking a short walk or doing some stretching. It gave me a sense of control and structure. I also tried to limit my exposure to news and social media, as it can be overwhelming.

Remember, your thoughts are not facts. You're not stuck inside your head, and there's help available. Consider reaching out to a therapist or support groups online. They can offer you guidance and support during this challenging time. You're strong, and you can get through this.","

First, just know that you're not alone in this. Many people experience physical symptoms as a result of anxiety, and it's not uncommon for it to feel like there's no escape. 

For me, it's helped to focus on my breathing and try to calm my nervous system. I know it sounds simple, but sometimes, taking slow, deliberate breaths can really help slow down your heart rate and calm your stomach. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body. 

It's also important to remember that this feeling will pass. It might not feel like it right now, but it will. Try to be kind to yourself and take things one moment at a time. You got this, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Sending you all the calm vibes, OP.","

Your observation about assuming others are busy and feeling bad about it is spot on. It's like our brains are wired to assume the worst-case scenario. But here's the thing - people are often just busy, or maybe they're dealing with their own stuff. It's not always about us.

Like, letting the dog out or shaving might only take 10 minutes, but it's a weight off your mind.

Also, try to prioritize your wants over your perceived needs. You mentioned wanting to go to the gym, read a book, or play with your dog - why not schedule those things in and treat them as non-negotiables? That way, you'll have a sense of structure and purpose, and you can fit in the smaller tasks around those activities.

I was called lazy when I was tired, inconsiderate when I was just clueless, ungrateful when I was not pleased... I try to think that my parents were genuinely trying their best, and some of the shitty behavior was also what they've experienced as children themselves. it's a daily exercise in patience and forgiveness.
kudos for figuring it out, OP.",212,arbolitoloco,"I ruined a florida vacation once by spilling my grapefruit juice (I was five or six) at an iHop. I am 39 and my mother has never gone into an iHop or Waffle House or anything similar again because of how I ""humiliated her that one time."" I remember being dragged out by the arm with her screaming.",2,phoenix-corn,"I can totally relate to your experience. Growing up in an environment where every little thing is blown out of proportion can have a lasting impact on our anxiety levels. It's like we're constantly walking on eggshells, waiting for the next explosion.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this. Many people have had to deal with overreacting parents, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the pattern and its effect on you. That's a huge step towards healing and growth.

One thing that might help is to acknowledge that your mom's reactions were likely a reflection of her own anxiety and stress, rather than your actual mistakes. It's not about you; it's about her struggles. When you can separate your self-worth from her reactions, you might start to feel more at peace.

Remember, you deserve to live a life without constant fear of judgment or explosion. It's okay to set boundaries with your mom, and prioritize your own emotional well-being. Keep taking care of yourself, and know that you're not alone in this journey.","

9ygehp,Anxiety,Currently In a busy resturant eating by myself not giving a fuck,Lovelifepending,....small steps,1199,88,1542631204,Damn!  That is one of my goals to accomplish by the end of this year! ,172,PuzzleheadedIssue,Damn!  That is one of my goals to accomplish by the end of this year! ,172,PuzzleheadedIssue,"""I totally get it, eating alone in a busy restaurant can be intimidating, but it sounds like you're taking control and doing what feels right for you. Those small steps you mentioned are actually huge - it takes a lot of courage to do something that might make you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious.

I just wanted to say that it's awesome you're prioritizing your own needs and doing what makes you happy. Eating alone doesn't mean you're lonely or awkward, it just means you're enjoying your own company (which is a really valuable skill to have).

If you don't mind me asking, what brought you to this moment of feeling confident enough to eat alone in a busy restaurant? Was there something specific that helped you get to this point, or is it just a gradual build-up of self-assurance? Either way, keep celebrating those small wins - they add up!""","

jzw1t3,Anxiety,Does anyone get an uncontrollable amount anxiety before going to bed knowing you have to wake up for work?,Phat-Rooster,"No matter what I do, I always feel sick to my stomach anxious knowing I gotta go to work the next morning. 

Fast forward to the next morning, I‚Äôm still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don‚Äôt smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn‚Äôt think this would get as much response as it did. 

I‚Äôve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn‚Äôt even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he‚Äôs sick. He‚Äôs been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It‚Äôs the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It‚Äôs crappy, but true.

I keep reminding myself that work and my ‚Äú real ‚Äú life are separate. No one can physically harm me through my work. I take a lot of slow deep breaths and I sleep with a weighted blanket. Every time it threatens to steal another night of sleep I keep telling myself that it‚Äôs separate and must stay that way. It can‚Äôt touch my real life. Hope that helps.",34,redheadofwonder,"I can totally relate to your anxiety about work, and it's even more heartbreaking knowing your dad's struggles with severe panic attacks. Witnessing the impact on your family must have been incredibly tough. I commend you for being open about your own anxiety and for offering support to others who may be struggling.

One thing that might help you is establishing a relaxing pre-bedtime routine, like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. This could signal to your brain that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep. Also, consider journaling or writing down your thoughts before bed ‚Äì sometimes putting your worries on paper can help clear your mind.

Another approach is to try to reframe your thinking about work. Instead of worrying about the next day, focus on the present moment and what you can control. Remind yourself that you've made it through tough days before and can do it again.

Your story and willingness to listen to others is truly inspiring. Keep being a source of support and comfort for those around you.","

ogud85,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they‚Äôre too difficult to love?,Kaitcatkitten,"Between the constant panic and worrying, the irritability, the non stop second guessing. The sometimes not being able to do normal every day things alone like shopping and driving. I feel like I‚Äôll never have a solid relationship where someone understands me. I feel undeserving of love. There‚Äôs no way I could ever maintain a healthy relationship and the reality of this sucks.",1172,114,1625833086,"I feel similar. 

I do not feel undeserving of love, yet I am clear with myself that it ain‚Äôt easy to be with me. I‚Äòm not jealous, not needy etc, but like you said, I have anxiety when it comes to shopping, or going to get together and my bf has to go alone often because I prioritiese my mental health over being at these events. 

What I feel is that whenever I met someone in the past and the first love cloud blinds them, they say how they don‚Äôt mind, how it‚Äòs not a Problem and they will never be annoyed by my anxiety and need to unwind alone more often than others - though I know better and tell them so (maybe I shouldn‚Äôt). And, surprise, after 6 to 9 months it starts to be a problem, maybe not one that gets said out loud a lot, but you feel if someone thinks ‚ÄûWhy can‚Äòt she be easy going, extroverted and social a bit more?‚Äú 

It feels like partners start to try to change my after the first glow of being in love is over, and to me that means it isn‚Äôt love - the kind that you feel for someone unconditionally, take them as they are, as the person you met. 

I really hope you find your person, the ones who isn‚Äôt only in love or has a crush on you, but who will love you more each day exactly how you are and support you.",102,Water_Melonia,"Everyone is difficult to love. Love is difficult. But true love is unconditional. People who care for you in all the right ways will find it easy to love you! You might tell yourself otherwise, and perhaps that‚Äôs a conditional love you have for yourself?",75,[deleted],"I can totally relate to how you're feeling. It's like, you're already carrying this heavy emotional burden, and the thought of adding someone else to the mix can be overwhelming. But here's the thing: you're not too difficult to love. You're just... complicated. And that's okay. We all are.

It might be helpful to reframe your thinking - instead of beating yourself up over your anxiety and worries, try to see them as a part of what makes you, you. And yeah, it might take some time to find someone who gets it, but that doesn't mean you're undeserving of love. It means you need someone who's willing to put in the work to understand and support you.

It's also worth considering therapy or counseling - not just for your anxiety, but for building self-compassion and learning how to communicate your needs in a relationship. You don't have to do this alone, and having a solid support system can make all the difference. You're not alone in this feeling, and I truly believe you're worthy of love and connection.","

hik9ew,Anxiety,Anybody else hate speaking on the phone?,JLR105,"I have absolutely no problem speaking to whoever in person. Just no problem. But picking up the phone and make a call... God, it drives me anxious to oblivion. I don't know why, but it's one of the most uncomfortable things for me.",1150,136,1593510454,"I **never** want to talk to **anyone** on the phone, to the point where I will have my spouse order pizza or answer unknown numbers on my phone if I‚Äôm waiting for a call.

But, I work in a call center because I needed a job desperately at the time. The stress I feel on a daily basis is unbearable. All I get to warn me that a call is coming through is a beep on the phone. Then I have to keep a calm customer service voice whether or not I‚Äôm being yelled at, talked over, or being blamed for a bad connection.

It‚Äôs a living nightmare for me. One my superiors even tried to guilt me into staying by telling me I wouldn‚Äôt function in another job because of my anxiety. It‚Äôs made me decide to leave the job because they‚Äôve overstepped their bounds into bullying to keep me around (I have nearly perfect performance scores because I worry about doing badly).",165,[deleted],[deleted],23,[deleted],"I totally get it. I used to be the same way - no problem chatting with people in person, but put a phone in my hand and I'd freeze up. I think part of the issue is that on the phone, you can't pick up on nonverbal cues like body language and facial expressions, so it can feel a bit more isolating and uncertain.

One thing that helped me was to prepare ahead of time for calls. Write down what you want to say, take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that it's okay to pause or ask for a moment to collect your thoughts. It's also helpful to try to reframe your thinking around phone calls - instead of viewing them as a source of anxiety, try to see them as an opportunity to connect with someone and get something done.

You're definitely not alone in this, and it's totally normal to feel this way. If it makes you feel any better, I've gotten way more comfortable with phone calls over time, and I'm sure you can too.","

nqqr5j,Anxiety,I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,throwfaraway1912,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a ""let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe"" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return. You are all amazing people and you are all FIGHTERS - not failures. You have helped me see that I am not a failure either, and I wish I could give each and every one of you a hug.

Some days I get really down on myself but other days I'm like FUCK YEAH I'm not having panic attacks every day after work and wanting to die because of my physical symptoms. I am so proud of you for making that decision because I know it wasn't easy. Hang in there bud!!!",224,No-Thanks-470,"Try not to think about others now! Your health is the most important thing now.

It's not selfish, it's necessary. Six years of teaching is no small feat, and it's okay to acknowledge that it's taken a toll on your mental and physical well-being.

When it comes to telling your supervisor, try to focus on your own needs and boundaries. You can express your gratitude for the experience and the opportunities you've had, but also be clear and direct about why you're leaving. It's not about disappointing others, it's about taking care of yourself.

Remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and you're definitely not a failure. It takes courage to admit when we need to make a change, and you're showing that courage. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to focus on the things you can control. You've got this, and you'll get through this transition.

First of all, let me just say that it's normal to have these thoughts. It doesn't mean you're actually annoying or that you need to become a neutral person with no personality. It just means you care about how others perceive you, which is a good thing.

My advice would be to try to practice some self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone has awkward moments, and it's okay to make mistakes. Instead of beating yourself up over what you said, try to focus on what you learned from the conversation. And when you start to feel like you need to stop talking, take a step back and ask yourself if that's really what you want.

It might be helpful to think about what specifically is causing your anxiety about going back to work and college. Is it the fear of getting sick, or is it more about the social aspects and feeling overwhelmed? Once you pinpoint what's causing your anxiety, you can start thinking about ways to address those specific concerns.

It's also okay to acknowledge that you've grown accustomed to the benefits of working from home and having more control over your schedule. Maybe you can find ways to incorporate some of those benefits into your post-quarantine routine, like setting aside time for meditation or finding ways to minimize office chatter.

For as long as I can remember I have done this, I like to wake up super early for things and just lay there doing nothing because I feel like sleeping all the way until the stressful event is too fast and if I just lay there awake I can savor every second that I have of not doing the thing. 

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn‚Äôt like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I‚Äôm a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep. Just laid there under my blanket trying to keep my mind as blank as possible and enjoy the nothingness before my day. 

Also, sorry if this has been posted a million times, anxiety is something I‚Äôve long been diagnosed with but I have always avoided it and only now am I starting to try to share about it and confront it little by little.",1227,53,1611063293,"Same here. I‚Äôve been this way ever since I was little. I was under the impression that I‚Äôm just a morning *and* a night person, when really it was anxiety all along. Even to this day, if I have to be up by 8am, I‚Äôll wake up at 5am.",84,ClearBlue_Grace,,0,,"I totally get it, OP. I used to do the same thing, especially before big exams or stressful events. It's like my brain was trying to delay the inevitable, and by doing so, I felt like I was regaining some control over the situation. It's amazing how you've only recently realized this might be a manifestation of your anxiety - kudos to you for taking steps to confront it.

One thing that helped me was to reframe this behavior as a form of self-care. Instead of beating myself up over ""wasting"" time, I started seeing it as a way to calm my nerves and prepare myself for what's ahead. I'd also try to use this time to do something I enjoy, like reading, listening to music, or simply observing my thoughts without judgment.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. Sharing your experiences and confronting your anxiety is a huge step, and I'm proud of you for taking it. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support or guidance.","

It's amazing that you're feeling this deep connection with Olly already.

It's great that you're acknowledging your anxiety and taking steps to create a safe space for Olly. That in itself is a huge accomplishment. Remember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and you'll figure things out as you go. The most important thing is that you're willing to learn and provide love and care for your little guy.

Those feelings of joy and love you're experiencing are a great reminder that you're capable of empathy and connection. Don't underestimate the impact Olly can have on your mental health ‚Äì the bond between a pet and their owner can be incredibly therapeutic.

Enjoy this time with Olly, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any advice or just need to share your cat dad experiences. Welcome to the cat parent club!","

How about finally working the courage to make a call and it goes to voicemail!,46,bringingdownthehorse,"""I completely get it, and it's not just you. The sound of a phone ringing or vibrating can be really triggering for some people. I think it's cool that you're recognizing your anxiety response and exploring it.

For me, it's not just the sound itself, but the anticipation and uncertainty that comes with it. Who's calling? Is it something important or urgent? I think our brains are wired to respond to those unknowns, even if it's just our phone vibrating.

One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around phone calls. Instead of assuming it's always bad news, try to remind yourself that it could be a friend or family member reaching out to catch up. Also, consider turning off notifications or putting your phone on silent mode when you're feeling anxious.

It's also interesting that you mentioned calling your mobile phone from your house phone. Maybe it's not just the sound, but the feeling of being 'on edge' when you're expecting a call. Either way, it's good that you're exploring your anxiety and talking about it. You're definitely not alone in this feeling.""","

bat8cd,Anxiety,Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?,EffiMuffi,"I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?",1190,88,1554726709,"Absolutely. Every single day, especially when I‚Äôm trying to sleep at night. Those thoughts just invade my head. It‚Äôs sooooooo tiring, I just want to switch that part of my brain off. ",153,LieutenantSauron,,0,,"I totally get why this would still be bothering you, even after all these years. It's like, you thought you'd left those feelings of embarrassment and humiliation in the past, but they can still sneak up on you. I've definitely been there too - it's crazy how vividly we can recall those cringe-worthy moments, even a decade later.

One thing that might help is recognizing that those people who made fun of you in high school were likely dealing with their own issues and insecurities. It's not uncommon for people to mock or belittle others to feel better about themselves. It doesn't excuse their behavior, but it can help you see that it wasn't all about you.

Also, try to reframe those memories in a more positive light. You survived high school, and you've built a successful life since then. That's something to be proud of. It might take time, but try to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that you're not defined by those moments. You're so much more than your high school experiences.","

The election stress, the ongoing pandemic, and the usual seasonal blues can be overwhelming. I'm proud of you for taking that huge step and scheduling a therapy session ‚Äì that's not always an easy thing to do.

I think it's essential to acknowledge that our limits can change over time. What we managed during the initial lockdowns might not be sustainable for us now. It's okay to admit that we need more support and to take care of ourselves.

If you don't mind me asking, what are you hoping to work through in therapy? Sometimes sharing our goals and expectations can help us feel more prepared and focused. Either way, I'm sending you lots of positive vibes, and I'm here to listen if you need someone to talk to.","

fxc59w,Anxiety,Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,luxuryballs,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don‚Äôt let your imagination get the best of you.",1216,59,1586371377,Wait... WHERE IS THE FIRST 25%???,232,Saberleaf,Wait... WHERE IS THE FIRST 25%???,232,Saberleaf,"I completely resonate with this post, and I'm so glad you shared it. As someone who's struggled with social anxiety, I've found myself getting caught up in overthinking and trying to control how others perceive me. But you're absolutely right - it's a losing battle.

The 25% rule is such a liberating concept, because it reminds us that we can't control how others think or feel. And honestly, that's okay. What we can control is how we respond to those interactions and how we take care of ourselves in the process.

Your advice to not waste time and energy worrying about what others think is spot on. It's so easy to get caught up in our own imaginations, especially when anxiety is at play. But the truth is, most of the time, people are thinking about themselves, not us.

Thank you for this reminder to breathe, let go, and focus on our own well-being. It's a valuable lesson that I'll definitely be carrying with me.","

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.)

It takes a lot of courage to stand up for your mental health, especially when faced with skepticism and dismissal. I can imagine how invalidating and frustrating that must have been for you.

It's great that you sought a second opinion and found a doctor who takes your mental health seriously. That's exactly what you deserve - a supportive and understanding healthcare provider.

Don't underestimate the impact of your complaint, even if it may not lead to immediate action. Reporting incidents like this can help create a culture of accountability and promote better care for patients with mental health conditions.

You're not alone in this, and there are people who believe you and care about your well-being. Keep taking care of yourself and seeking the help you need. Congratulations on taking this important step, and I wish you all the best on your journey to healing and recovery.""","

I can almost feel your frustration when you say you want to 'talk' to your anxiety. I think that's actually a great approach, though. Instead of trying to 'punch it in the face,' maybe try to have a more compassionate conversation with yourself. Ask yourself what's really scaring you, and remind yourself that you've survived tough situations before.

It might also be helpful to look into some anxiety management techniques, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation. These can help calm your nervous system and give you more control over your anxiety. Remember, it's okay to feel scared or overwhelmed, and it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.""","

I'll have constant flash-backs to some cringy thing I said or did and I just sit on the couch and freak out and it makes chilling after work impossible. 

It doesn't help that im super anxious around people so I'm always overanalysing myself at work and I'm constantly worried about coming across some type of way and so I don't say much (which i think probably just makes me seem rude anyway). 

Is anyone else stuck being so critical over every interaction they have? And has anyone found anything that helps them wind down after interacting with people? I'm so exhausted mentally and it makes work hell. 

Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile.",1187,85,1623408707,"Immediately after I do something deemed cringeworthy in my mind (which let‚Äôs be honest, when you have anxiety that can be a lot of things) I obsessively think about it and how people perceived it.

Try to tell yourself that you are just doing the best you can. You‚Äôre not doing anything cringeworthy. You‚Äôre just you.

One thing that's helped me is to set a ""no replay"" rule for myself when I get home. I try to focus on something else, like a book or a hobby, to distract myself from those pesky flashbacks. Exercise also helps - it's like my brain is too tired to worry about what I said at work.

Another thing to keep in mind is that people are generally way more focused on themselves than on you. They're not thinking about that one thing you said as much as you are. Try to be kind to yourself and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get home from work and obsess over every interaction they've had during the day?

POST BODY: This happens to me every day I come home from work. I'll have constant flash-backs to some cringy thing I said or did and I just sit on the couch and freak out and it makes chilling after work impossible. 

It doesn't help that im super anxious around people so I'm always overanalysing myself at work and I'm constantly worried about coming across some type of way and so I don't say much (which i think probably just makes me seem rude anyway). 

Is anyone else stuck being so critical over every interaction they have? And has anyone found anything that helps them wind down after interacting with people? I'm so exhausted mentally and it makes work hell. 

Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile.

That and less anxious times my voice rises and I sound like a mouse. And yes I mispronounce and even forget words. You're not alone ,163,Karayanna,,0,,"""Hey OP, I totally relate to this. I used to get so flustered in social situations that I'd stumble over my words or completely forget what I was saying. It's like my brain just freezes up.

One thing that's helped me is taking a few deep breaths before speaking. It sounds simple, but it can really calm your nerves and give you a moment to collect your thoughts. I also try to focus on the conversation itself, rather than worrying about how I'm coming across. It's not about being perfect; it's about communicating and connecting with others.

Another thing you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. This can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, so you're better equipped to manage them when you're feeling anxious. And remember, it's okay to make mistakes ‚Äì it's all part of the learning process.

You're not alone in this, and it's not a reflection of your worth or intelligence. Keep working on it, and I'm sure you'll see improvement over time.""","

I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough.

The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

tjg8w0,Anxiety,Does anybody else cope by just looking forward to going to sleep,Putrid-Substance-952,"A coping mechanism I have is that I‚Äôll sort of get through the hours of the day until it is nighttime and I know I can have the sweet release of sleep soon. Of course this isn‚Äôt every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it‚Äôs the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don‚Äôt mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day.

Even if the night is long and dreadful, it's the only time some of us can really be, well, us!  To cry and weep about our problems during the day just doesn't always work out.  And when I say this I mean no hate!  I Just wanted to mention it, that's all.",1,Shyurinn,"I can totally relate to looking forward to sleep as a way to cope with anxiety. It's like having a daily refuge from the overwhelming feelings and emotions that can be hard to manage. I think it's great that you've found something that works for you, even if it doesn't sound like the most conventional coping mechanism.

It's interesting that you mention having days where you enjoy the things you're doing, but still find yourself counting down to bedtime. I think that's a great reminder that it's okay to have a mix of good and bad days, and that it's normal to need a break from our emotions, even on the good days.

If you don't mind me suggesting, it might be worth exploring some other coping mechanisms to add to your toolkit, like mindfulness, deep breathing, or creative activities. Not to replace sleep, of course, but to give you more options for managing anxiety during the day. You might find that having more tools at your disposal makes it easier to enjoy the day, rather than just counting down to bedtime.","

It's like your body's 'fight or flight' response is hyper-activated, and instead of freezing or fleeing, you're ready to take on the world (or at least the person in front of you).

It's possible that your upbringing played a role in shaping your response to stress, but it's also important to remember that anxiety and anger are closely linked in the brain. When we're anxious, our brain's threat response is triggered, and anger can be a way of trying to regain control or assert ourselves.

As for fixing it, I wouldn't say it's about 'fixing' it entirely, but more about developing healthier coping mechanisms. Mindfulness, deep breathing, and physical exercise can all help calm your nervous system and reduce anger outbursts. It's also worth exploring therapies like CBT or DBT, which can help you become more aware of your emotions and develop more constructive ways of managing them.

Remember, you're not alone in this - and it's okay to take your time figuring it out.","

It's amazing how easy it is to neglect our physical well-being when anxiety takes over.

I love the list of self-care activities you've shared - they're all so simple yet effective. For me, it's been about incorporating tiny moments of physical relaxation into my daily routine, like taking a few deep breaths before bed or doing some light stretching in the morning. It's not about finding a ton of extra time, but rather being intentional with the time I already have.

One thing that's helped me is to reframe self-care as a form of self-compassion, rather than something I ""should"" be doing. It's not about being selfish or indulgent, but about acknowledging that my body and mind are connected, and that taking care of one helps the other. Thanks for sharing your wisdom, OP - I'm so glad I'm not alone in this journey.","

POST TITLE: I did it üòä

POST BODY: I have agoraphobia. My therapist took me to a coffee place, and we sat for an hour. I was tense and shaky, but no panic attacks!! I was able to keep calm and carry a conversation. First time I've been able to sit in a place and not feel like I'm at a high anxiety level in over a year. I'm quietly proud of myself, so I just wanted to share üòä

I know some might think that's not a big step, and it's not but that's okay. Small steps are just as important, because I'm still going forward üíú

It takes so much courage to confront anxiety head-on and make significant changes to your lifestyle. I can only imagine how tough it must have been to deal with 11/10 anxiety, but it's amazing that you've found a combination that works for you.

I especially love that you've emphasized the importance of acceptance and using the Claire Weekes method - it's a powerful tool for managing anxiety. And it's great that you've found a healthy balance with medication, diet, exercise, and sleep. It's clear that you've put in the work to prioritize your well-being.

One thing that might be helpful to consider is how you'll maintain this progress in the long-term. Have you thought about developing a self-care routine or finding healthy coping mechanisms to deal with any future triggers? Not that you're not already doing amazing, but it's always good to have a plan in place.

Try to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Think about all the times your fianc√© has shown you love and support. Those moments are real, and they're not just pretending to care about you. It might also help to talk to your fianc√© about how you're feeling. They might be able to offer some reassurance and help you see things from their perspective.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel this way. Just take it one step at a time, and try to be kind to yourself.","

Here's the thing: most people are more understanding than we give them credit for. If you can, just own up to the mistake and apologize sincerely. It shows that you're aware of your actions and willing to make amends. And if you can't apologize in the moment, don't beat yourself up over it afterwards. Just move forward and try to be more mindful in the future.

Also, try to reframe your thinking - instead of ""I'm a rude person,"" tell yourself ""I had a moment of awkwardness, but I'm learning from it."" It's okay to make mistakes, and it doesn't define your character.","

g78nn7,Anxiety,I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,Sinister-Laugher,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense.

Any tips on how to shake this feeling off?",1213,42,1590487972,"I relate to this so much, I‚Äôve internalized even the smallest critique for years and hold onto it, it‚Äôs an awful thing 

This might sound a little wishy-washy but I‚Äôve found writing daily affirmations has started to help me accept my imperfections, ones I write regarding this issue are: ‚ÄòI am not my mistakes‚Äô ‚ÄòIn every struggle lies a learning experience‚Äô and ‚ÄòI forgive myself‚Äô. Sounds silly but the more I write them out and say them it tricks my brain into believing it more.

Also doing something I‚Äôm bad at (for me, starting ballet again) has been helpful in that case bc I make a LOT of mistakes and get critiqued by my teacher, but it‚Äôs been pushing me to accept that I will never be perfect, and criticism is inevitable, but if I do my best i will be proud of myself. 

Not sure if any of this is helpful, I think it‚Äôs about sitting with yourself and working out what exercises  you can give yourself to challenge that particular anxiety. Good luck and remember none of us will ever be perfect, and growth is a good thing!",55,brittanica_7,"Yeah I can't even express how much I feel this. One thing that really helps is reminding yourself that people understand that you don't mean anything bad by what you're doing and, they will mainly appreciate that you listened to them and cared enough about them to want to change.
Also! Remember to think positively about yourself, it helps you to remember nice things that people say about you. Take care of yourself, I hope things get better!",52,cimwolf,"I totally get it - that feeling of being a burden and taking criticism to heart is a tough one to shake. It sounds like you're already being pretty self-aware, recognizing that the coffee might've played a role in your anxiety spike. üôÉ

One thing that might help is to remind yourself that criticism (especially constructive criticism) is not a personal attack. It's often about the specific action or behavior, not about you as a person. Try to separate your self-worth from the thing being criticized.

Also, when you start spiraling, take a step back and ask yourself if the criticism is really about making others' lives worse, or if it's just your anxiety talking. Would the people around you really think you're a ""piece of shit"" over a small mistake? Probably not.

Lastly, practice some self-compassion. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay not to be perfect. You're not a burden, and you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of.","

I've been there too, lying awake at 3 am, my brain racing with worries that just seem to multiply in the darkness.

First, know that you're not alone in this. It's super common for anxiety and sleep to be intertwined. But here's the thing: it's not a chicken-and-egg problem, where you can't tell what's causing what. It's more like a seesaw ‚Äì when one side goes up, the other side goes down.

So, focus on what you can control, which is your anxiety. Try some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation. There are tons of free resources online that can help. Also, consider setting a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to conquer anxiety and sleep all in one night (pun intended). Just take it one breath, one relaxation technique, or one sleep cycle at a time. Hang in there, and know that you're not alone in this struggle.","

If anyone is feeling overwhelmed or just needs someone to talk to, I'm here to listen too. OP, your offer to chat is amazing, and I'm sure it's appreciated by many. To anyone else, don't be afraid to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or even a helpline (like the Crisis Text Line) if you need support. You're not alone, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.""","

It's infuriating when people don't take the time to understand the complexities of mental health, especially social anxiety.

As someone who's been working on your social anxiety, you should be proud of yourself for taking that first step. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your struggles and take action. Don't let one insensitive comment discourage you from continuing your progress.

Remember that you're not alone in this fight. There are people who care and understand what you're going through. If you ever need to talk or vent, there are resources available, both on and off campus. Keep pushing forward, and don't let anyone minimize your feelings or experiences. You got this!","

I want to add to your message: it's okay to not be okay too. It's okay to break down, to cry, and to ask for help. In fact, that's often the first step towards healing and moving forward.

If you're feeling safe enough to reach out, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. They can offer you a listening ear, guidance, and support as you navigate through tough times.

Edit2: but mostly you OP üòé",150,BeanToasted,"From the second I saw the title of this post I felt a connection to it. I've thought that same thing countless times. ...now onto reading the rest of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had the worst day I've had in a while. Very similar to the situations you described. Just as I thought I was becoming pretty good at this adulting thing, it felt like I had reverted to being a little kid. Scared of making mistakes. Unable to control my behavior. It was an awful feeling. I'm glad it's over now, but like you, it's pretty fucking humiliating. And disappointing...you feel like you're getting your shit together and then everything just falls apart again one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what you can do. All I know of is just find some degree of peace tonight and start again tomorrow. I wonder, are you always so anxious that you get tearful? Or do you normally just feel bad but without crying?

&amp;#x200B;

Is feeling incompetent something that's been bothering you for a while now? Have you been comparing yourself to other people a lot more lately, like there's something to lose if you aren't the best (e.g. a new coworker that might perform better than you, a new mutual friend with your partner that might get new attention, hope that you could successfully achieve your goals if you don't do well at your current job now)? All of those things can stack up and it sounds like maybe you have a lot more behind your anxiety than usual since you're posting this.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm finding that my returning depression is making my anxiety a lot more crybaby-ish and prone to catastrophizing than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Sending good vibes. Let's try to make tomorrow a little better (or more realistically, just not as bad).",19,vitamin-water,"I totally get it, and I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're dealing with a mix of anxiety, self-criticism, and sensitivity - which can be a really tough combo. First of all, please know that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with these feelings, and it doesn't mean you're not ""made for this world."" It just means you might need to develop some strategies to cope with your emotions.

One thing that might help is practicing self-compassion. When you make a mistake or feel like you're not good enough, try to talk to yourself in a kinder way. Instead of beating yourself up, remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect.

Also, consider talking to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop some coping strategies. And hey, if you need to take a break from checking your email or step away from a situation that's overwhelming you, that's okay too. You don't have to be ""tough"" or ""strong"" all the time. You can take care of yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being.","

Anyone else feels like this?",1168,77,1605883663,"I‚Äôve felt like that for all of high school. Truth is: if you really were annoying, people would tell you, believe me. Or people would avoid you and would not speak to you. 
I used to think like that because I was extremely self conscious due to being bullied for years. I thought no one would like me and I was a burden. 
But I wasn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm pretty sure you aren‚Äôt as well. 
Ask people you trust about this. It‚Äôs scary, but it helps. Ask them if your voice sounds weird and tell them how you feel about wasting their time. I‚Äôm sure their answers will calm you down and make you more confident. You can use this to work on yourself and get better. 
I for myself can say that I don‚Äôt think you are annoying and you did not waste my time by asking this.

Edit: I just saw some of your other posts. Dude, come here, take this virtual hug. 
I hope you are ok. It will get better.",144,Necessary-Ad-3753,"I am not sure if I annoy or just offend people tbh. Sometimes I see that they are angry, or there is something wrong with what I've said. And I know it is not just in my mind, cause people don't engage with me much.

Sometimes I even say to them to tell me if I am being insensitive or smth. But they never do.

Maybe they think I'm stupid, cause my thoughts wander a lot and I cannot give them a straight answer right away. Or maybe they think I'm borring.

I've got used to it so I just take it as a part of my life.

I've tried a therapist but it was a bad match and maybe I would do it again someday with someone else.

Don't realy have anything positive here, so sorry.
Maybe try to see what are the facts? Are there people that care about you? Is there someone who speaks to you? Anxiety can lie realy good.",5,Disappointedburritoo,"I totally get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're struggling with some pretty intense self-doubt and social anxiety. I've been there too, and it's exhausting.

First of all, let me tell you that it's unlikely that you're actually annoying everyone around you. People generally respond positively to genuine interactions, and it's okay to take up space and have conversations.

That being said, I understand why you might feel that way. One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking around interactions. Instead of assuming you're annoying someone, try to focus on the value you're bringing to the conversation. Are you sharing a funny story, or asking a thoughtful question? Those are things that can actually enrich someone's day.

It might also be helpful to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or say something awkward. It's not the end of the world, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. You're not alone in this feeling, and there are people who care about you and want to connect with you.","

I have watched my favorite Disney films again and again over the course of this past year. One impressive feat (for me at least) is I have watched all of South Park 3 times now lol.

Rewatching familiar shows can be a great coping mechanism for anxiety. It's like revisiting an old friend - you know what to expect, and it can be really comforting. I've been guilty of this too; I've lost count of how many times I've watched The Office or Parks and Rec. There's something about the predictability and nostalgia that can be really soothing.

I think it's great that you've recognized this pattern in yourself, though. It might be worth exploring why certain shows or movies are more comforting to you than others. Is it the characters, the setting, or something else entirely? Understanding what specifically makes you feel calm might help you discover new shows or movies that can bring you similar comfort.

In any case, don't worry about not ""branching out"" to new shows - if rewatching old favorites helps you manage your anxiety, that's all that matters. Keep doing what works for you, and don't be afraid to reach out if you need any extra support.","

I've been through my own share of tough times, and I can attest that it's the kindness of strangers (and friends, of course) that can help make all the difference.

Your words are a great reminder that recovery is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to not be okay. But with time, patience, and support, we can get through even the darkest of times.

If anyone reading this is struggling, I want to echo OP's sentiment: you are not alone, and you are loved. Reach out to someone, whether it's a friend, family member, or stranger on the internet ‚Äì we're all in this together. Thanks again, OP, for spreading some much-needed love and positivity.","

fbbp70,Anxiety,Does anyone else bite their lips or inside of their mouth because of anxiety?,throwawayidc69,I‚Äôm always biting my lip especially at night when I‚Äôm trying to fall asleep sometimes causing it to bleed a little. Any tips on how to stop doing this? It causes red marks on my lip that I get insecure about but I just can‚Äôt stop. :/,1064,179,1582978382,I‚Äôm chewing on the inside of my cheeks and lips while reading this,227,Clannibal,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally feel you. I used to do the same thing, especially during stressful periods or when I'm trying to fall asleep. It's like my brain is trying to release tension, but my poor lips end up paying the price.

One thing that helped me was becoming more aware of when I'm doing it. I'd catch myself biting my lip and make a conscious effort to stop. I'd take a few deep breaths, relax my jaw, and focus on something else. Sometimes, I'd even put a lip balm on to remind me to be gentle with my lips.

Another thing that worked for me was finding other ways to release tension, like fidgeting with a stress ball or doodling. It's like my brain needed something to focus on, and once I found a healthier outlet, the lip biting stopped.

You're not alone in this, and it's not something to be insecure about. It's a sign of anxiety, and acknowledging it is the first step to overcoming it. Keep working on it, and don't be too hard on yourself. You got this!","

And then you feel guilty?,OhSampai,"This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can‚Äôt? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I‚Äôm literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more.

I lay there like ‚Äúoh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven‚Äôt even gotten up... what is the point?‚Äù and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in.

It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of anxiety and depression that's creating a vicious cycle. On one hand, you're anxious about being late, but on the other hand, your depression is making it hard for you to take action.

First of all, please know that it's okay to not be okay. It's great that you're recognizing your patterns and acknowledging the emotional struggles you're facing. One thing that might help is to break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire routine, try focusing on one task at a time (e.g., getting out of bed, then putting on clothes, etc.). This can make it feel less daunting.

Additionally, be kind to yourself and try to reframe your negative self-talk. Instead of beating yourself up over being late, remind yourself that you're doing the best you can with the resources you have. And hey, it's okay to be late sometimes! It's not the end of the world, and people are often more understanding than we think.","

Anxiety is a shit roommate, so please be shitty to it in return.",147,LORDCOSMOS,"I love the attitude - ""sheer disrespect towards anxiety"" is the best way to put it. It's amazing how something as mundane as a car wash can trigger anxiety, but it's even more amazing that you're acknowledging it and pushing through.

I think it's great that you're recognizing the source of your discomfort (the chemical smell) and still choosing to face it. That takes a lot of courage. And yay for winning against anticipatory anxiety - the line of cars could've been a major setback, but you powered through.

One thing that might be helpful in the future is to prepare yourself beforehand by taking some deep breaths, visualizing a positive outcome, or listening to calming music on the way to the car wash. But honestly, it sounds like you're already doing a great job of managing your anxiety, so keep it up!

Your car may be pretty now, but you're the real winner here. Keep showing anxiety who's boss!","

It's okay to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and it's amazing that you're recognizing those feelings and giving yourself space to process them. If you're comfortable, take some time to breathe, go for a walk, or do something that usually helps you unwind. It might not make the anxiety disappear, but it can help calm your mind.

Remember, you're not alone in this. We've all been there, and it's okay to not be okay. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

Remember that this experience will only make you stronger and more confident for the next time. Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go as planned, and keep celebrating your small wins. You've got this, and you're capable of overcoming your anxiety to put yourself out there. Keep pushing forward and stay proud of yourself!""","

You are right, your mental health is yours and shouldn't appear on Internet without your consent.

It's frustrating when our boundaries aren't respected, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like our mental health. I can imagine how embarrassing it must be to have your personal info shared with people you don't know.

First of all, kudos to you for speaking up and setting those boundaries with your mom. It's not always easy, especially when it's a family member. Your comment was calm and clear, and it's great that you expressed your feelings without being aggressive.

One thing to consider is having an open and honest conversation with your mom about why you're uncomfortable with her sharing your personal info. It might help her understand your perspective and respect your boundaries better in the future.

Remember that you have the right to control your own narrative and decide what you want to share with others. Don't let anyone make you feel like you're being overreacting or too sensitive. You do you, and prioritize your own comfort and well-being.","

mhlufw,Anxiety,Please stop medication shaming,Suspicious_Loan,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",893,346,1617244920,"""What? You're taking antibiotics? You're not strong enough to fight that infection on your own. Have you tried fitness instead, bro?""",257,Mango__Loco,"Fortunately, this isn't a phenomenon that happens too much around this sub specifically but it's rampant elsewhere particularly from people selling snake oil and life coach ""anxiety is simple to fix"" mumbo jumbo. I have widespread brain damage resulting from an acquired brain injury (ABI), bilateral intraventricular brain hemorrhages as a very young child. Naturally, brain damage makes me high risk for all sorts of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. I seem to have ended up with a bunch of fear-related conditions - GAD, panic disorder, phobias, and trichotillomania which is a misguided attempt to cope and self-soothe. My therapist has been zero help for my GAD. CBT has been helpful for learning to cope with panic attacks and reduce my hair pulling, but not for GAD...when you're unreasonably anxious about everything and nothing and you know it but you can neither stop it nor ignore it, there's no rationalizing it away. Medication was the biggest help for my GAD, not therapy, the only thing that treats the root of the problem. Sometimes therapy and meditation and coping skills are just band-aids, they just treat the symptoms.

Going to a psychiatrist and starting meds was the best decision I ever made. Every person's experience is different, I can only share my own. The hardest thing about psychotropic medication is that it is usually not a quick fix, more like a scavenger hunt. You have to find the ""right"" medication for you, the one that works for you is unique to your disorder, genes and brain chemistry. If you take the wrong one, it may work but have intolerable side effects or may in fact actually make your anxiety worse even after the first few weeks of adjustment have passed (some only temporarily worsen anxiety, but that stops after a few weeks and then it improves past baseline).

I'd been in therapy for about nine months before I took the plunge and gone through two therapists. Both of my therapists were upfront with me after I'd been in treatment for a while, like ""in your case therapy is not likely to be sufficient"", they told me they could only be so helpful when anxiety is very severe. Does therapy help me manage my anxiety? Yes. Does it help me *stop* it? Hell no. I wanted my anxiety *gone* and that's not something CBT is capable of, that's not what it's designed to do. It just teaches you to cope with your illness.

Because of that, on therapy alone it's basically an endless, futile, fruitless fight between my coping skills and reframing and whatnot...and my brain. My anxiety has a *huge* impact on my functioning. Therapy, exercise, meditation, all those things have their place, but they also have their *limits*. It's not a panacea. None of that shit could stop the infinite storm of anxiety in my brain, the ruminating, the panic attacks, the nightmares and insomnia and compulsive hair pulling to the point of bleeding. Medication was the missing piece for me. I work at a mental health agency IRL so I don't have the fear of treatment and medication that some seem to. Medication and therapy combined are clinically proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety. Taking medication reduces your anxiety enough that you find that you are more receptive to therapeutic techniques, therapy becomes more useful and you're able to make more progress in therapy.

I take Citalopram/Celexa and it's magic. I have zero irrational anxiety - the sickening pit of dread is gone. I also take hydroxyzine for insomnia and for occasional panic attacks with success. Whatever is wrong with my brain that causes this intolerable anxiety and panic - Celexa fixes it. It's basically magic. Sometimes there's a biological cause, a difference in your brain, and medication gets to the root of the problem, and therapy and lifestyle changes only help manage the symptoms. 

Here's the thing about the side effects monster: for severe anxiety, you'd need some truly mad side effects to outweigh the benefits of the eradication of your anxiety. That's a *huge* benefit. *Most* ""side effects"" are more aptly named *adjustment effects* because they usually disappear by the end of the first month. You can handle that, you've lasted this long through insane anxiety, haven't you? For me, my adjustment effect was dry mouth. Big whoop. Nothing difficult there, gone like the wind by the end of the third week. Long-term, I have nothing more sinister on the three drugs I take than increased diarrhea which is no big deal whatsoever, because:

   A. I already had daily diarrhea anyway. It's 99% painless, merely annoying and an anxiety symptom regardless (as are most drug side effects), and 

   B. My anxiety was so severe that I'd have to have some truly gnarly, completely awful and intolerable side effects to make me even *consider* stopping...and none of the possible side effects of my drugs fall into that category. My SSRI has improved my life *exponentially.*

There are obviously people who have serious side effects and bad reactions, but drug manufacturers are legally obligated to report everything that everyone in trials *perceived* as ""side effects"", even if only three people out of 10,000 experienced it, and even if that 'side effect' may not have been related to the drug at all - just coincidentally happened while they were doing the drug trial, so therefore people's brains (hello, anxiety!) immediately jump to worst case ""oh shit, it's the drug!"". For a lot of those serious side effects (sexual side effects excluded), your chances of experiencing them is pretty damn low.

For online reviews, you're setting yourself up for failure from the start because it's like anything else; the happy people are not motivated to leave reviews, they're off living their lives, only the people who had bad experiences do, so it's skewed toward the negative. Often, people don't follow their medication regimen as they should: they mention that they start too high, they quit cold turkey, they skip doses, they take it on an empty stomach instead of with food, they stop after two days or two weeks and then complain it's the medication instead of user error. 

I've also seen my share of reviews that gave a bad rating not actually for any negative experience *on* the drug but because when they *stopped,* their anxiety came back and they were mad about it. No shit, Sherlock, what did you expect? You were feeling better *because* of the pills, why did you stop? 

It's like every other medical condition - you have a condition, you take medicine for it, symptoms go away. You stop taking medicine, symptoms come back. Anxiety. High blood pressure. Diabetes. Epilepsy. Arthritis. Everything. That is how medicine *works,* when nothing is there to hold back the tide of your condition, *obviously* it will come back and you'll experience symptoms again. You do still have to *work* to  control your medical condition, yes, like everyone else on the planet. 

Anyway, no amount of CBT in the world could do what Celexa does for me. The only problems I still have are my trichotillomania and uncontrollable nightmares, both of which have been my constant companion for sixteen years now. I have nightmares all night, every night, and wake up every 60-90 minutes usually in a cold sweat, shaking or crying, I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night, when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. I just recently had my very first good dreams in sixteen years and I suppose I can thank my Celexa for that (honestly a miracle), but before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Therapy was useless for it. I have found nothing to help. 

SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to work and for the first few weeks, Citalopram did nothing. Nothing good, nothing bad. And then all of a sudden one day it *worked*, I realized...I'm *calm*. I'd forgotten what that felt like. It had been sixteen years since I'd known that feeling. And I'm going on five months and that feeling has persisted. It's *beautiful.* I feel *normal.* I feel like *me* and I'd forgotten who that was, the person who isn't constantly hounded and crippled by anxiety and panic. I still get stressed in situations that would cause a normal, non-anxious person anxiety, but the constant, sickening pit of dread is gone thanks to my medication. I can't say enough good things about my experience with Celexa. The day I went to the psychiatrist for the first time is the best day of my life, no contest. 

I didn't think this was possible. Let me repeat that: I *work* at a mental health agency, and I was so far down the hole that there was no light. I'd been in therapy and while it helped with behavioral things, like coping with panic attacks and distracting myself, choosing behavioral alternatives to pulling my hair to self-sooth, therapy alone didn't and *couldn't* help as much as I wanted. It did nothing for my irrational, panicked brain - because that's just the nature of my brain, fundamentally. It's a disorder. I didn't know that *calm* was an achievable state for me anymore. I began therapy after a breakdown during a panic attack...I tried to amputate my fingers and realized there was no more denying it, this was obviously a disorder (turns out, a lot of them actually) and not an unfortunate assortment of flaws and personality quirks like I'd spent fifteen years desperately trying to convince myself. Starting medication was easily the best decision of my life and had a huge impact on my happiness, my functioning, every aspect of my life. I was constantly making myself sick with worry over the *stupidest* things, and even over absolutely nothing, and I knew it was stupid but I *couldn't stop*.

I could kiss my psychiatrist, I owe her my life.",14,larki18,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Medication shaming is never okay, especially within the anxiety community where we're supposed to support each other. It's infuriating when people dismiss the struggles of others, implying that they're weak or not trying hard enough.

First of all, thank you for sharing your story and being honest about your experiences with medication. It takes a lot of courage to do that, especially when you're facing judgment from others. I want you to know that you're not alone, and there are people who understand and respect your choices.

It's essential to remember that everyone's journey with anxiety is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Meds can be a lifesaver for some people, and that's okay. Your therapist sounds amazing, and it's great that you've found someone who gets it.

To anyone reading this who might be tempted to shame someone for their medication choices, please just don't. Offer support, listen, and respect people's decisions. And to the OP, keep doing what works for you, and don't let anyone make you feel ashamed for it.","

POST TITLE: Please stop medication shaming

POST BODY: This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*

I was about 1.5-2 hours early each time because I was so anxious about not knowing if there was traffic that time of day on that road, finding parking, finding the hotel, finding the hotel room, etc etc etc. It was too much",5,_criscodisco,"I totally get it, OP. It's like, intellectually you know you're going to be early, but that anxiety just takes over and makes you feel like you're running late no matter what. I've been there too.

One thing that's helped me in the past is to focus on the things I can control, rather than the things that are outside of my control. So, instead of stressing about leaving at a certain time, I try to focus on the steps I need to take to get ready and out the door. Like, I'll make a mental or written checklist of everything I need to do, and then I'll just focus on checking each thing off the list.

It's also helped me to remind myself that being early is a good thing! It's better to have some extra time to collect my thoughts before work than to be rushing in at the last minute. Maybe try to reframe your thinking around leaving early, and see if that helps to reduce your anxiety. Hang in there, and I hope you find something that works for you!","

I've been there too, where I've over-shared and then felt like I've given away too much of myself. It's like, I'm trying to connect with someone, but then I realize they might not be as invested as I thought.

For me, it's helpful to take a step back and remind myself that people are busy with their own lives. Just because someone doesn't react the way I expect, it doesn't mean they don't care ‚Äì they might just be preoccupied or not know how to respond.

To cope, I try to be more mindful of my sharing. I ask myself if I'd feel comfortable sharing this with someone I don't know well, or if I'd regret it later. I also try to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about how someone might react in the future.

It's okay to share and be vulnerable, but it's also okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own comfort level. Remember, you don't have to share everything with everyone ‚Äì it's okay to keep some things to yourself.","

About 3 months in, I told him I was having a bad anxiety day and asked if I could come over. I was so scared of being rejected. My ex once told me my anxiety annoyed him. So... well... I'm sure you understand. 

Anyway, after he said yes and I was over, he put on a movie and put a pizza in the oven. After we ate and when the movie was over and I felt more relaxed, he asked me what happened. So I told him everything. And I was calm so I said it felt silly that I let this stuff get to me. And he said ""but it was important to you. Is there something we can do if this happens again? To help you calm down?""

Y'all... I held it in but when I was going home I was crying happy tears. He even told me I was always welcome when I had a bad day. And... it felt so nice to be heard, taken care of, and to have someone care enough to help me figure out how to manage things in the future.

To have someone respond with empathy and a willingness to dig deeper is a game-changer.

One thing that's helped me in similar situations is to acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers right away. Sometimes, it takes time to untangle our thoughts and emotions, and that's where having a supportive partner can be a lifesaver. Your husband's response shows that he's committed to understanding you, and that's something to cherish.

Remember that it's also okay to take things at your own pace. Don't feel pressured to have it all figured out right away. Just knowing that you have someone by your side who's willing to navigate the ups and downs with you can make all the difference.","

I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it.

I totally get why it's hard to prioritize your own wellbeing, especially in a new job where you're still trying to make a good impression. But here's the thing: taking care of your mental health is NOT a sign of being a bad employee - it's actually a sign of being a responsible and self-aware one.

Remember that you can't pour from an empty cup, and if you're running on fumes, you're not going to be able to perform at your best anyway. So take today, take a few deep breaths, do something that relaxes you, and remind yourself that you're doing this for your own good.

As for the guilt, try to reframe it as a necessary investment in your own wellbeing. You're not being selfish, you're being proactive. And honestly, if your employer can't understand that, then maybe they're not the right fit for you anyway. Keep taking care of yourself, and don't be afraid to do it again when you need to.""","

It feels like the whole weight of this ridiculously bad year is with me all the time. I worry about the world more than myself. Hugs to you friend,153,louieblue68,"I totally get where you're coming from. It's like being an empathetic person with anxiety puts you in this constant tug-of-war between staying informed and protecting your mental health. I think it's amazing that you're so dedicated to being an ally and staying informed, but it's also essential to acknowledge your own limits.

Rather than completely avoiding the news and social media, maybe try setting boundaries for yourself? Limit your news intake to specific times of the day or week, and take breaks when you need to. You can also try following accounts or news sources that focus on solutions and positive change, rather than just the problems. This way, you can stay informed without feeling overwhelmed.

Remember, taking care of your mental health doesn't mean you're being privileged or ignoring social justice issues ‚Äì it means you're acknowledging your own capacity and taking steps to sustain yourself for the long haul. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being.","

aipmmi,Anxiety,It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,6DEVIL,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family.

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality.

I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder.

It's heartbreaking to think about how many of us struggled with undiagnosed anxiety and OCD as kids, and how it's affected our lives as adults.

First of all, please know that it's not your fault that no one recognized your anxiety back then. Mental health awareness has come a long way, and it's not uncommon for kids to be mislabeled as 'shy' or 'sensitive' when in reality, they're struggling with anxiety.

As for your current situation, I want to encourage you to keep seeking out resources online, even if in-person help is limited. There are plenty of online communities, forums, and therapy platforms that can provide you with support and guidance. It might not be ideal, but it's better than nothing.

I want to acknowledge that it's not 'not much' - it's a huge accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself. It's clear that you've been working hard to manage your anxiety and find ways to cope.

One thing that stood out to me was how you used deep breathing and conversation to distract yourself from your anxiety.

Those types of comments can be incredibly invalidating and dismissive. It's like, anxiety isn't something you can just ""stop"" doing, it's a genuine emotional response to a situation. Imagine if someone told you to just ""stop feeling sad"" when you're grieving - it's not that simple.

What I've found helpful is to remind myself that people who say those things often don't understand what it's like to live with anxiety. They might be coming from a good place, but they just don't get it. It's not about you, it's about their own limitations.

When someone says something like that to me, I try to take a deep breath and respond with something like, ""I appreciate your concern, but anxiety is a bit more complicated than that."" It helps to set boundaries and educate them a bit, without feeling like I need to justify my emotions. Sending you lots of support and understanding - you're not alone in this.","

I think one of the hardest things about managing mental health is the self-doubt that can creep in when we're having good days. It's like, 'Am I really struggling, or am I just making excuses?'

I love that you emphasized the importance of hard work and dedication in recovery. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.

One thing that's helped me is to differentiate between my intuition and my anxiety.

Your suggestions are all really helpful, and I especially appreciate the emphasis on self-love and self-care. It's so easy to get caught up in negative self-talk, but making a conscious effort to practice self-compassion can be a game-changer. I'll definitely have to check out that book, ""Breath"" - I've heard great things about it.

fg3x6f,Anxiety,"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?",Vehicle_Voltron,"Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?",1127,96,1583795710,"Yes. I feel like I am drunk or hungover. My brain feels like mush. So I used that time to try and just experience, if that makes sense. Just lay in bed and feel- the bed, my clothes, etc. I essentially reset my brain and have a numbness. Breathing normally and shit

Edit: I'm so amazed and happy that so many people could relate to this! ‚ù§ it will get better... or I hope so",113,emilmetal,,0,,"I can totally relate to what you're going through. It sounds like your body is still processing the stress and adrenaline from high-anxiety events, even after they're over. This is actually pretty common, and it's almost like your body is experiencing a kind of ""emotional whiplash.""

First of all, just want to acknowledge that it's really brave of you to keep pushing through and attending events despite your anxiety. It's clear that it's not easy for you, but you're not letting it hold you back entirely.

As for the ""hangover"" period, I think it's just your body's way of releasing all the pent-up tension and stress. One thing that might help is to prioritize self-care after these events. Take some time to relax, engage in activities that calm you down (like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga), and try to eat nourishing foods to help your body recover.

Also, just a heads up: those heart palpitations and chest discomfort can be super scary, but they're often just a symptom of anxiety and not a sign of anything more serious. If you're concerned, it's always a good idea to talk to a doctor, but it's also possible that your body is just reacting to the stress. Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this!","

I've experienced similar symptoms, and I've found that deep breathing exercises can really help calm me down. When I start to feel that heat rising, I try to focus on slow, deliberate breaths, inhaling through my nose and exhaling through my mouth. It's not a magic cure, but it can help take the edge off.

Also, have you tried progressive muscle relaxation? It's a technique where you systematically tense and relax different muscle groups in your body. It can help release physical tension and calm your nervous system. It might be worth giving it a shot.

Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be a real challenge, but it sounds like you're already taking some steps to manage it (ice packs and fans, for example). Keep taking care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.","

I can only imagine how tough it must've been to deal with the anxiety and depression, especially after losing your previous job. It's amazing that you found the courage to go for that interview, and it sounds like the new job is a great fit for you.

I totally get that small steps can make a huge difference in our mental health journeys. It's awesome that you're acknowledging you still have work to do, but you're taking things one step at a time. That's a really healthy approach.

Remember to be kind to yourself and don't put too much pressure on yourself, especially in the early days of the new job. It's okay to take time to adjust and figure things out. You've already shown you're capable of overcoming some tough challenges, so I'm sure you'll continue to do great.

Keep taking care of yourself and celebrating those small wins ‚Äì they'll add up over time. You got this!","

7aimw8,Anxiety,Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can‚Äôt be at peace until you get it over with?,Yu-Gai-Hoh,"I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I‚Äôll be having fun for a second and then i‚Äôll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?",1124,95,1509706781,"I used to. Here's why it happens and how you can stop it.

The reason why is that you have trained your mind (and in reality, it has been trained by outside forces) to look at future events critically. If you're like me, you think of everything that can possibly go wrong when you go out, you think about hard it'll be, how tired you'll be. What if you miss the bus? What if there's traffic? What if the other person is late? What if what if what if.

What if is the poster child of the anxious thought. It can seem like a good idea, to prepare yourself for the next days tasks, but our problem is that we only ever think *negatively* about the next day.

But if doing things was ALWAYS negative, you wouldn't ever do things. 

So try this instead. Start to visualise what you need to do tomorrow entirely positively. Instead of thinking worst case, start to think best case. Imagine seeing your friend, and they're super happy to see you. Imagine the food you'll eat. Imagine the fresh air, blah blah. Just go through the next days task, imagining it entirely possible.

Anxiety and excitement feel quite similar when low level. So it's possible to reconfigure your mind to interpret that anxious feeling as just being excited for the next day.

After you complete the day, get some post it notes. Write three notes about the things you enjoyed that day, put em in a jar or something. 

Remember, anxiety occurs in your mind, and it colours your reality. But the same can be said for positive emotions. It's why so many people in life talk about it. If you start to think positively, your body will react as if something positive is happening. 

You can do it, you can cope, it's not too much for you! 

If you're still at a point where the anxiety is just too high to do this stuff, don't worry. You might need a little bit of CBT first, I found that helped me a huge amount. You might need to learn and practice some mindfulness techniques and meditation.

But it's entirely possible to rewrite your brain, so don't worry. If you keep going, keep trying, you can make it.",280,Kaiisim,I‚Äôm the opposite. Having something to do or somewhere to be helps me know that my worrying will cease cuz my mind will be on something else.  ,8,Carlosaro,"I totally get what you're going through. It's like your brain is constantly reminding you of the next task, making it impossible to fully enjoy the present moment. I've been there too, and it can be really frustrating.

One thing tha's helped me is to acknowledge those thoughts, but not let them consume me. When I start to feel anxious about the next day, I take a few deep breaths and remind myself that I've got this. I've prepared as much as I can, and whatever happens tomorrow, I'll deal with it then.

Another strategy is to set aside a specific time to think about the next day, like right before bed or during a dedicated planning session. This way, you can contain your thoughts and worries to a specific time, rather than letting them bleed into your entire day.

Lastly, try to focus on the things you can control in the present moment. Instead of worrying about tomorrow, engage with what's happening around you, whether it's a conversation, a beautiful view, or a fun activity. It's not always easy, but with practice, you can learn to quiet that anxious voice and live more in the moment.","

uj43wk,Anxiety,Does anyone 'comfort' themselves by talking to themselves?,ACrypticCrusader,"During a panic attack, do you ever speak to yourself in the third person and tell yourself ""it's okay' or ""you're gonna be fine""?",1055,163,1651775962,"Oh, absolutely yes I do. I can guarantee you aren't alone doing so.",197,ImSpoons,"When I talk to myself I use ""we."" ""We"" includes the part of myself I directly control and the part of myself that I don't directly control.",27,Kwakigra,"I totally do this.  When I'm feeling overwhelmed or having a panic attack, talking to myself in the third person can be really soothing. It's like my brain can separate from the anxious thoughts and offer some reassurance. I'll be like, ""Hey, you're going to get through this"" or ""You've dealt with this before, you can do it again.""

I think it's actually a pretty common coping mechanism, and it can be really helpful in calming yourself down. It's almost like having an internal dialogue with a trusted friend who's there to offer support and comfort.

If you're doing this and it's helping, don't worry about it being weird or anything. It's just your brain's way of trying to take care of you. And if you're not doing it but are looking for new ways to cope, I'd definitely recommend trying it out. Just be kind to yourself and try to focus on the present moment. You got this.","

Vision stuff can be especially unsettling, so I'm sending you some solidarity vibes. For me, it's been helpful to try to separate the physical symptoms from the anxiety itself. When I start to feel those weird sensations, I remind myself that they're just my brain's way of responding to stress. It doesn't mean anything is actually wrong with my body.

If you're comfortable, what kind of vision stuff are you experiencing? Is it blurry vision, floaters, or something else? Sometimes talking about it can help me process and feel better. Either way, just wanted to let you know you're not alone in this weird anxiety world","

bknhwo,Anxiety,Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,Humble_Narcissist_00,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older.",1028,189,1556990767,"I‚Äôve been anxious since puberty. Middle school, around the time I got my period I started becoming really quite and started obsessing over things. High school it turned into anxiety about grades and responsibilities, and now in college it‚Äôs everything but I‚Äôm on meds and seeing a therapist so I guess that‚Äôs good lol. I also notice it gets really bad around my time of the month. Still trying to convince my doctors of it...",79,annmarieg5,"I‚Äôve been anxious since I was a kid.

It only struck me like three years ago just how long I‚Äôve been dealing with this bullshit. I remember having full blow anxiety attacks when we had to do Mad Minute Multiplications in 4th grade cause I was scared to be timed and not do as well as everyone else. Also explains why I started therapy at 9... 
but yeah I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs always been with me. I just didn‚Äôt realize what it was until I developed depression at 15. No one told me it could be anxiety, no one thought a little 6 year old could be so scared of failing and being worthless. I had to do my own research and eventually I began to see a therapist again who diagnosed me.",41,derpskerpinkattz,"I totally get where you're coming from. I've been dealing with anxiety since I was a kid too, and it's only in recent years that I've started to understand and address it properly. It's great that you're taking steps to seek help and work through your anxiety.

I think it's really common for people to assume that anxiety starts later in life, maybe due to a specific event or experience, but for some of us, it's just always been there. I've found that acknowledging and accepting that can be really freeing.

One thing that's helped me is reframing my anxiety as a signal that I need to take care of myself, rather than something to be ashamed of. It's also been helpful to focus on small, manageable steps rather than trying to tackle everything at once.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's amazing that you're taking the first steps to get help. Keep going, and don't be too hard on yourself ‚Äì you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

The constant gas, bloating, and nervous stomach feeling can be really debilitating. I've found that taking care of my gut health has helped me a lot. Probiotics, in particular, have been a game-changer for me. I take them daily, and they seem to help regulate my digestive system.

Exercise has also been a big help for me. It's not just about physical health, but also about releasing endorphins, which can really help calm down anxiety. Yoga, in particular, has been great for me - it helps me relax and center myself.

Lastly, I just want to remind you that you're not alone in this. It's so common to experience stomach issues when you're anxious, and it's not something to be ashamed of. If you feel comfortable, try talking to a therapist or a doctor about what you're going through. They can offer you some personalized advice and support.

I've been there too, and it's really tough to feel like your anxiety defines you.

Here's the thing: you are more than your anxiety. It's okay to acknowledge its presence and the impact it has on your life, but don't let it consume your sense of self. Think about the things you enjoy, the things that make you laugh, the things that bring you joy. Those are still a part of you, even if they feel overshadowed by your anxiety right now.

It might be helpful to try to separate your anxiety from your personality. What are your values, interests, and passions? What kind of person do you want to be? Focus on those things, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. And remember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to support you through this tough time.","

It's great that you're acknowledging your mental health and seeking support. Remember that there are people who care and want to help. If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to your university's counseling services or a trusted friend/family member. They can offer you the support and understanding you deserve. Don't give up on speaking out ‚Äì your voice matters, and there are people who will listen and care.","

ocf9xy,Anxiety,Does anyone else just hide when people are outside of their house?,doometteowo,"  Just like the teenager memes about hiding in your room when company is over, I'm in the adult version of this situation. I'm one of those teenagers who is now grown with a home of my own. There's a guy working on my roof and I've been in hiding all morning. 

  I can't let my dogs outside yet or they will bark and draw attention to me. I can't go too close to the windows or he will see me. I can't watch TV or play music or he will know I'm here. I have to tiptoe around my house so it seems like no one is home.

Social anxiety or just plain introversion can make interactions feel overwhelming, even when it's just someone working on your house.

First of all, let's acknowledge that it's totally okay to feel this way. It's not dumb, and it's not irrational. It's just you taking care of yourself and your comfort level.

If you don't feel like interacting with the guy, that's perfectly fine. You can just wait it out, and he'll be gone before you know it. If you're worried about your dogs, maybe try giving them some quiet activities to keep them occupied, like puzzle toys or a long-lasting chew.

Remember, your home is your sanctuary, and you have the right to feel safe and comfortable in it. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to take some deep breaths. You got this, and it'll all be over soon.","

Anxiety can wreak havoc on our digestive system, and it's like, a never-ending cycle.

Firstly, it's great that you're trying to manage your symptoms with ginger tea, Pepto, and a heating pad. Those can definitely help soothe your stomach. Have you considered talking to a doctor or a therapist about your anxiety? They might be able to help you develop some coping strategies to reduce your anxiety levels, which could in turn alleviate your stomach issues.

In the meantime, some things that might help are deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or even just taking a short walk outside to clear your head. It's also a good idea to keep a food and symptom journal to track any patterns or triggers. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

First of all, kudos to you for standing up for yourself and referencing the EU law clause - that takes courage! Now, when you're ready, take a deep breath and open that email. Remember that the customer support team is just doing their job, and their response doesn't define your worth or the validity of your claim.

If their response is negative, try not to take it personally and consider escalating the issue if needed. If it's positive, great! You've successfully advocated for yourself. Either way, it's a learning experience, and you'll come out stronger. You got this!","

My weight is constantly in flux because of this . If I didn‚Äôt smoke weed I don‚Äôt think I would eat at all,127,Flunk_Waffle,"I totally get it, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's like your body and mind are in a vicious cycle, and it can be really tough to break free.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this. Many people experience a decrease in appetite when they're anxious or stressed, and it's not uncommon for it to become a source of more anxiety.

One thing that might help is to try and separate your anxiety about eating from your actual hunger cues. Instead of worrying about not eating, try to focus on small, manageable goals like having a few sips of water or a small snack when you feel like it. It's not about forcing yourself to eat a full meal, but about taking tiny steps towards nourishing your body.

Remember, your weight loss is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are so much more than your weight, and it's okay to not be okay right now. Take things one step at a time, and be kind to yourself. You got this, and you're not alone.","

It's bad very often, so yeah...",1083,123,1596201691,Yes. It can definitely make it much harder for me to focus on anything other than what‚Äôs making me anxious.

If I could recommend one, The Worry Trap.",2,ARomaningCatholic,"I totally get it. I've been there too, and it can be really frustrating when something you love, like reading, becomes a source of anxiety. For me, it's been helpful to break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of trying to read a whole chapter or more, I set a timer for 10-15 minutes and challenge myself to read just that amount. When the timer goes off, I take a break and do something else to calm down. It's amazing how much of a difference it makes.

Another thing that's helped me is to choose books that are a bit more ""low-stakes"" - you know, not too intense or heavy. Sometimes, I'll pick a lighthearted romance or a fun sci-fi novel that's easy to get through. It's not always about reading the most complex or literary book, but about enjoying the process and relaxing.

Remember, it's okay to take your time and prioritize your mental health. You're not alone in this, and there are plenty of us out here who understand what you're going through. Hang in there, and happy reading (when you're ready)!","

First of all, just want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's normal to crave a break from it all. However, I also want to gently remind you that that 'pill' might not be the solution you're hoping for. When we numb ourselves to our emotions, it can be hard to feel the good stuff too.

What might be more helpful is finding healthy ways to cope with the stress and anxiety you're feeling. Whether it's talking to a therapist, practicing mindfulness, or just taking a few minutes each day to breathe and focus on yourself - there are ways to find some peace without losing your connection to the world.

You're not alone in this feeling, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Would you be open to talking more about what's going on and how you're feeling? Sometimes just sharing can help lighten the load.","

kzo87a,Anxiety,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,nojox,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards. Replying will take time. Y'all know how it goes - up and down, excited, scared, happy, sad, the full range in an hour!",1110,96,1610948244,I have made this into my desktop wallpaper cuz shit I need to read this everyday,67,ambitchous_13,"Wow, i'm gonna have to read this every morning. I really needed something like this at the moment. Thank You!",2,CannibalMX,"I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for sharing this incredibly insightful post. I've been struggling with anxiety for a while now, and your words really hit home. It's so easy to get caught up in the fear cycle and forget that our minds are capable of creating entire scenarios that aren't based in reality.

I especially appreciated the distinction you made between eustress and excess fear. It's helpful to remember that a certain level of fear can be useful, but when it becomes paralyzing, it's time to take a step back and reevaluate.

Your suggestion to repeat ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" is a great one. It's simple, yet powerful. I've started doing it myself, and I've already noticed a slight shift in my mindset.

Thanks again for sharing your wisdom and experience. It's comforting to know that I'm not alone in this, and that there are people out there who understand what I'm going through.","

It's more than normal to want to be by yourself, especially if you're not someone who thrives in social situations. Three months of quarantine might not be enough for you to feel socially rejuvenated, and that's okay. You don't have to force yourself to be someone you're not.

For tonight's gathering, maybe have an honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're having a tough anxiety day and you'd rather not attend. It's better to communicate your boundaries than to put yourself in a situation that makes you uncomfortable. 

Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Don't feel guilty about prioritizing your own needs.","

POST TITLE: Honestly not wanting quarantine to be over

POST BODY: I haven‚Äôt done anything social since covid started and I‚Äôm loving it. I hate parties, I hate social events so the fact that I like almost legally can‚Äôt go to any is great. Our state just okayed social gatherings of &lt;10 people though so immediately my boyfriend‚Äôs friends decided to have a fire and invited us. 

I‚Äôm having an absolutely awful anxiety day - I‚Äôm guessing the fact that it‚Äôs tonight is primarily causing it, and I don‚Äôt want to go at all.

Is it normal to want to be by yourself this much? It‚Äôs been almost 3 months of quarantine and I‚Äôm still not socially rejuvenated.

First of all, take a deep breath and know that you're not alone in feeling this way. We all have those moments where it feels like the world is crashing down around us. 

If you're feeling comfortable, would you be willing to share what's going on? Sometimes talking about it can help you process and release some of that pent-up energy. If not, that's okay too - just know that you have a community here who cares and is listening.

In the meantime, take a few minutes to do something that relaxes you - listen to some calming music, take a short walk, or practice some deep breathing exercises. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's temporary. You got this, and you'll get through this tough moment.","

c0li0r,Anxiety,anyone gets stomach upset when anxious ?,sharplee123,"I always get a very bad stomachache (diarrhea, constant farting and all kinds of smelly stuff) especially when i get anxious - and it‚Äôs always my left side of my stomach. Ugh..it‚Äôs truly awful..anyone had the same experience or is currently going through it?

*updated post*
Hello again everyone - thank you so much for sharing your experience! definitely did not expect to receive a lot of comments. My only big difference with you is that I‚Äôve never been nauseous but just pumping out a lot of gases haha. Anyway, thanks again for your comments. I‚Äôm glad I am not alone in this:)",1034,166,1560526524,"This, 100%.   I get super nauseous with my anxiety peaks.  Which really sucks for things like going out to dinner or anything to do with food.  Then the nausea leads to more anxiety about throwing up, its a vicious cycle.",272,mtnlife991,"I like to call them anxieturds or anxiarrhea depending on how bad..... 

Ps you feel it on your left side because of the way your lower intestine is shaped in you abdomen üòä",7,flowercrownsNfetuses,"Hey OP, I totally feel you. I've experienced similar stomach issues when I'm anxious, and it's no fun at all. The constant farting and diarrhea can be super embarrassing, especially if you're in a public place or have plans with friends.

First of all, just want to say that you're definitely not alone in this. Anxiety can wreak havoc on our digestive systems, and it's more common than you think. I've found that practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can really help calm my stomach and reduce symptoms.

Also, have you considered keeping a food diary to see if there are any specific foods that trigger your stomach issues? Sometimes, even if we're not nauseous, our bodies can still be reacting to certain foods that exacerbate anxiety symptoms.

Lastly, just want to remind you that it's okay to prioritize your mental health and take care of yourself. If your anxiety is impacting your daily life, it might be worth talking to a therapist or healthcare professional for some extra support.

Hang in there, and thanks for sharing your experience!","

8e6gsp,Anxiety,To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day,AeroNauseous,"This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. Let's make today great!",1107,93,1524433568,"I really needed this today, thank you. ",160,kittiesandgators,"Thank you, going to get up and shower now. Kinda eerie how accurate your post fit me. ",87,JanMichaelVincent69,"I just wanted to say thank you for this post, OP. Today has been a tough day for me too, and reading this felt like a much-needed reminder that I'm not alone. It's so easy to get caught up in the guilt and self-criticism when we have one of those self-sabotage days, but your words really helped put things into perspective.

One thing that's helped me on days like today is trying to reframe my thinking around 'mistakes' and 'slip-ups'. Instead of beating myself up over what I didn't do, I try to focus on what I can do in the next moment. It's not about being perfect, it's about being kind to myself and taking things one step at a time.

Your post is a beautiful reminder that we're all in this together, and that seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. Sending you lots of love and support, and thanks again for sharing this.","

As you start this new chapter, remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Being a public official can be overwhelming, but don't be afraid to lean on your colleagues, mentors, or even therapists for support. You've already shown that you're resilient, but it's also important to prioritize your mental health.

What's your plan for the first 100 days in office? Are there any specific initiatives or issues that you're passionate about addressing? I'm excited to see the impact you'll make in your community. Again, congratulations on this amazing achievement!""","

It's okay to take your time, focus on the present moment, and not put too much pressure on yourself to 'get better' right away.

It's like the whole weekend's relaxation just gets sucked away by the looming dread of Monday morning. I've been there too, and it's not fun.

One thing that's helped me is to try and break the cycle of negative thinking that starts on Sundays. Instead of worrying about all the things I have to do on Monday, I try to focus on the things I'm grateful for ‚Äì like having a job, or a comfy bed to sleep in. It's cheesy, but it helps.

I also try to do something relaxing on Sunday evenings, like taking a warm bath or reading a book. It helps calm my nerves and gets me in a better mindset for the week ahead.

Lastly, I've started setting small, achievable goals for Monday morning. It's not about tackling the whole week at once, but just getting through that first day. It makes it feel less overwhelming. Hope these tips help you, OP, and remember you're not alone in this ‚Äì we all get the Sunday Scaries sometimes.","

9xm7w6,Anxiety,"I bought myself tickets to a concert about two months ago just for myself. I forgot about it until this week, but I‚Äôve been really excited about it! Every single day, I‚Äôve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. I‚Äôm not even worried I‚Äôm going by myself.",lamy0720,"Edit: Friends, I made it! I got dressed up, made it to the venue, and I‚Äôm here! ",1087,110,1542375437,Excellent! Who are you going to see?,52,buttw0rm,"WELL I didnt make it to a stage on my own. BUT I danced and not next to the people I went with I went and stood further up on my own.. a little bit.. lol. It was a Trance Festival and everyone at Trance shows make me feel very comfortable. They are all so happy and Friendly. Easing myself into it. 

Ill leave you with this crazyness. And thank you a ton 

 Ive been having a reoccurring dream about going to the beach.. and I never get there. I can see the beach but something always happens keeping me from going to the beach. I like to dissect dreams... but I left this one alone because In reality.. ive been wanting to visit a real beach for a long time. I haven't been in years. So I though it was just a desire. 

I finally took the dream apart after I had a weird beach dream.. I found the beach in this dream and I fell to my knees to feel the sand and the sand turned into brown carpet. So i lifted up the carpet to look for the sand and there was another layer of carpet, I kept lifting up the layers of carpet (there were 3) and then there was this hole or window or something Where i could see the real beach and I became very upset because there were so many people on the beach that there was no place for me to sit and enjoy the peace and serenity. 

Anyway the dream ended up up being completely symbolic. The Beach is a Symbolic for the meeting place between my rational self (the Sand) and my emotional self (the water). The carpet was symbolic for the harsh realities of my life, the carpet being brown and dirty was symbolic for the foundation or comfort zone I have laid out for myself is no longer working for me and that I am refusing to confront issues in my life. Peeling up Carpet was symbolic that the way i view the world will be drastically changed and will specifically challenge my comfort zone. 

The sea specifically is symbolic for Emotional turbulence in my life and the everything that I worry about will resolve itself I overwhelm myself with my own emotions.. So I could see the resolution in my dreams.. but in this one.. the only thing keeping me from reaching that was all of the people I didnt want to be around. 
And what hit home for me here.. was the symbol of a crowded beach, It means that I seek company and a social life. It is the bridge that I need to cross to find the ocean.. My peace.. the meeting place between my rational and emotional mind. 
I am aware that Socializing is healthy.. and I used to at least try. Until I turned about 22 years old.. I spent the next two years avoiding people like the plague. Which is sad for me.. because I enjoy helping people, even if its out of blunt honesty and tons of people say I make them feel so good and happy Like I am a light in the dark.. but I just get so overwhelmed around them all. When I am not helping with problems..I dont know what to say. Advise comes easily out of my mouth.. but regular conversation.... no. there is no dictionary in my mind for that. 

Any way I thought it was a bit synchronistic that I was talking to you about trying to be social and then also got the message from my dream that Its time for me to try again. So thank you for contributing to that. 
",1,s0nder369thOughts,"""Hey OP, I'm so glad to hear that you made it to the concert and you're having a great time. It's amazing that you bought those tickets for yourself and are now getting to enjoy the experience without any anxiety or dread. That takes a lot of courage, especially going solo.

I think it's incredible that you've been looking forward to it every day without any hesitation. It's a great reminder that sometimes, the best experiences in life are the ones we have with ourselves. You're showing yourself that you're worth taking time for and that's something to be proud of.

For anyone who might be reading this and feeling nervous about doing something alone, I hope OP's story inspires you to take the leap. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own happiness and do things that bring you joy, even if that means going solo. Congratulations, OP, on embracing your independence and enjoying the concert!""","

Firstly, don't beat yourself up over the caffeine ‚Äì we've all been there. As for the racing heart, have you tried any relaxation techniques? Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation can really help calm your body down. You can find plenty of free resources online.

It might also be helpful to establish a bedtime routine that signals to your brain that it's time to wind down. This could be as simple as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing some gentle stretches.

Remember, it's not uncommon for anxiety to have a lingering impact on our physical bodies. You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're acknowledging and seeking support. Hang in there, and I hope you get some rest soon.","

I totally get why you'd be nervous about ordering, it can be intimidating, especially if you're not used to it. But it sounds like you pushed through and had a positive experience overall, which is awesome.

One thing that might help with ordering in the future is taking a minute to look over the menu before you sit down, or even checking it out online beforehand. That way, you can get an idea of what you're in the mood for and feel more confident when the server comes to take your order.

But honestly, the fact that you went out and did it anyway is what matters most. It's a big deal to put yourself out there and try something new, and it sounds like you handled it like a pro. Keep pushing yourself to try new things and you'll be surprised at how quickly you become more confident and comfortable. Keep it up!""","

It's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle, and it's hard to break free. I've been there too, and it's frustrating, to say the least.

First of all, let me just say that acknowledging your anxiety and its impact is a huge step. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so kudos to you for that.

Here's what might help: instead of looking at the assignment as a whole, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. That way, it won't feel so overwhelming, and you can focus on one thing at a time.

Also, have you considered talking to your prof or a counselor about your anxiety? They might be able to offer some guidance or accommodations that can help you get back on track.

Remember, it's not about being ""crippled"" by your anxiety; it's about finding ways to work with it. You're not alone in this, and there's help available. Don't give up ‚Äì you've got this.","

POST TITLE: Have you guys been crippled by your anxiety so much that you just don't do your assignments?

POST BODY: Hi,

This is me. Worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.

Not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. Its like a shitty negative feedback loop. 


As a result Im actually failing this unit lol. Every assignment has been handed late due to cripplying anxiety. 

I even got a fucking extension and I am way past THAT due date as well. 

God everything fucking sucks.

Use that victory to boost your confidence a bit :-) ",56,mtblastin,awesome! what helped you through?,2,Muchflamingo,"""Hey there, huge congrats on that victory. I totally get why it's a big deal for you - public speaking can be intimidating, and the voice shaking can be super frustrating. It's awesome that you pushed through and nailed it twice.

Here's the thing: it's not about the voice shaking or not, it's about how you own that moment. You did it, and that takes a lot of courage. Don't be too hard on yourself when your voice does shake in the future (because, let's be real, it might still happen sometimes). Just remember that it's not a reflection of your worth or your abilities.

You should be proud of yourself for facing your fears and coming out on top. That's something to build on, and I'm sure you'll continue to grow more confident in your public speaking skills. Keep pushing forward, and don't underestimate the power of those small wins - they can add up to make a big difference in the long run.""","

cdmy2t,Anxiety,Does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?,anxiousearthling,"Pretty much every social interaction I have with someone, no matter how small, I spend a ridiculous amount of time afterwards playing back what I said over and over again in my head.

Sometimes I get anxiety about things I said to people in 6th grade.

Edit: so I‚Äôm reading a lot of comments saying they suffer the same thing. Obsessive thinking like this is a common symptom of other things that aren‚Äôt anxiety. Like bipolar disorder and OCD. This is a reminder to make sure you are properly diagnosed. 

I was misdiagnosed for years until I was properly put on the right medication and these thoughts went away. Talk to your doctor because obsessing over thoughts from years ago isn‚Äôt a common thing in anxiety disorder. Please talk to your doctor.",187,[deleted],,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get it. I've been there too, replaying conversations over and over in my head, analyzing every word and tone, and somehow managing to convince myself I came off like a total idiot. It's exhausting, right?

First of all, know that you're not alone in this. It's actually a pretty common trait, especially for people who tend to be more introverted or anxious in social situations.

One thing that's helped me is to remind myself that most people aren't paying as much attention to what I say as I am. They're usually too caught up in their own thoughts and worries to notice the tiny details I'm obsessing over.

Also, try to practice some self-compassion. Instead of beating yourself up over perceived mistakes, try to reframe them as learning experiences or just plain old human moments. We all say something awkward or silly sometimes ‚Äì it's not the end of the world.

Lastly, if you find that this is really impacting your daily life, it might be worth talking to a therapist about. They can help you work through some of these thoughts and develop more constructive coping strategies. Hang in there, OP!","

It's tough when anxiety makes you feel like everyone's out to get you, and it's especially hard when you've had experiences that make you feel like those negative thoughts are justified.

First of all, I want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's not just your anxiety playing tricks on you - you've had real experiences that have led you to feel this way. But here's the thing: just because some people have made you feel a certain way, it doesn't mean that's how everyone sees you.

I want to encourage you to try to separate your self-worth from the opinions of others. You are so much more than how others perceive you. And honestly, most people are too caught up in their own lives to be thinking about you as much as you think they are.

It might sound cheesy, but try to focus on the people who do like and appreciate you. Surround yourself with those people, and let their positive energy counteract the negative thoughts. You are not alone, and you are not defined by your anxiety or the opinions of others.","

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc.

I think what you're describing is actually pretty common, especially for people who struggle with anxiety or perfectionism. It's like your brain is trying to find a sense of control or completion in a chaotic world.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking around ""completion"" and ""relaxation."" Instead of rushing to finish things so you can relax, try to focus on enjoying the process itself. Ask yourself, ""What am I getting out of this activity, besides just getting it done?"" or ""What would happen if I just took my time and enjoyed this?""

It might also be helpful to try to identify what's driving your need to rush. Is it fear of missing out? Fear of not being productive? Once you understand the underlying motivation, you might be able to address it and find more peace in the present moment.","

quvxse,Anxiety,Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?,NorthernAvo,"I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this?

Everyday.  But I've experimented enough with other jobs that the pros of going back to do what I was trained for outweighed the cons.,30,Jive_Bob,"I can totally relate to your feelings. It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of anxiety, loss of control, and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. I think it's awesome that you're recognizing these patterns and trying to address them.

One thing that might help is reframing your mindset around work and time management. Instead of seeing bedtime as a sacrifice, try to view it as an investment in yourself and your well-being. Remember that taking care of your physical and mental health is essential to performing well at work and enjoying the rest of your life.

It might also be helpful to set boundaries and prioritize self-care outside of work. Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you feel in control. Whether it's reading, exercising, or pursuing a hobby, make sure you're nourishing your mind, body, and soul.

Lastly, remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay with the status quo. It's normal to feel frustrated with the demands of modern life, and it doesn't mean you're weak or ungrateful. Keep exploring these feelings and seeking support ‚Äì you're not alone in this.","

dyfwbm,Anxiety,Hadn‚Äôt Left the house in four years update.,c3p0n0,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help.

POST TITLE: Hadn‚Äôt Left the house in four years update.

POST BODY: Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.

I think it's amazing that you didn't let fear hold you back, and instead, you used it as a chance to learn and grow. If you don't mind me asking, what helped you manage your anxiety this time around? Was there anything specific that you did differently?

zzvcgp,Anxiety,Anyone else want to run away to a remote cabin and live out their days as a hermit?,Neophyte43,"That would be sweet, aye?",1010,169,1672497160,"More than you know. Tiny home, acres of land, nobody around for miles. String retro lights above a rooftop deck and listen to nothing but the wind and trees swaying and the sound of birds in the trees. 

Cozy up during winter storms and rustle under a blanket while the outside winds pile against the windows. 

Yes please.",199,ignore_my_typo,"Mote like a deserted island, but yeah.",5,IanCGuy5,"I totally get it. There are days when the world just feels overwhelming, and the idea of escaping to a peaceful cabin in the woods sounds incredibly tempting. I think it's more common than you think - we all need a break from the hustle and bustle of life sometimes.

If you're feeling really burnt out, maybe take a smaller step towards that dream. Plan a solo camping trip or a weekend getaway to a secluded spot. You might find that it's just what you need to recharge. And who knows, maybe that'll be the push you need to start making changes in your life to make it feel more like that peaceful cabin all the time.

Just remember, as appealing as the hermit life may seem, it's not always as romantic as it sounds. Human connection is important too. If you're feeling really down, don't be afraid to reach out to friends or family, or even a therapist. They can help you work through what's going on and find a more balanced way to live.","

Thank you.",152,SoberBlonde,"I appreciate you sharing these words of wisdom with us. I think we've all been there - stuck in a cycle of anxiety and fear, feeling like the world is crumbling around us. But it's so important to take a step back, breathe, and remind ourselves that our emotions don't always reflect reality.

I especially love point 4 - laughing at the absurdity of it all. Sometimes, we just need to acknowledge that our fears are irrational and laugh them off. It's like a weight lifts off our shoulders.

One thing that's helped me in similar situations is practicing self-compassion. Instead of beating myself up over my anxiety, I try to be kind and understanding. I remind myself that it's okay to feel scared or overwhelmed, and that I'm doing the best I can. It's not always easy, but it's helped me to be more gentle with myself and to break free from those negative thought patterns.

Thanks again for sharing this. I hope it brings some comfort to those who need it today.","

One thing that might help is to find something to do during that 30-minute wait that makes you feel productive or relaxed. Grab a coffee, read a chapter in a book, or even just scroll through Reddit (no judgment). Having something to focus on can make the waiting feel less agonizing.

It's also worth considering whether there's something specific about being early that's causing your anxiety. Are you worried about being late, or is it something else? Reflecting on the root cause might help you address the issue head-on.

Hang in there, and try to enjoy those extra 30 minutes ‚Äì you've got this.","

I go over stupid stuff that happened years ago and get embarrassed about it,156,jk9961,Am I the only one who never knew this wasn‚Äôt normal?? ,2,Tits_McGee_Omg,"I'm so familiar with those days. It's like our brains decide to dig up every embarrassing or awkward moment from our past and put them on repeat. I've been there too, rehashing conversations or situations that are long gone, wondering what I could've done differently.

Here's the thing: we're all guilty of this to some extent. It's a natural human tendency to replay our mistakes or awkward encounters, but it's essential to remind ourselves that dwelling on them doesn't change the past. What it does is rob us of our present and future.

When I catch myself in this cycle, I try to acknowledge the thoughts, but not engage with them. I remind myself that I've grown since then and that those experiences have shaped me into who I am today. If you're feeling overwhelmed, try taking a few deep breaths, getting outside, or doing something that brings you joy. You are not your past, and you are more than those moments.","

lrhd7x,Anxiety,I no longer have suicidal thoughts,Kenny_K-Man,"Well actually I haven‚Äôt had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a ‚ÄúI want to die.‚Äù But I realize that I can‚Äôt kill myself, because I can‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs not in me, it‚Äôs in my head but it doesn‚Äôt tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can‚Äôt even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it‚Äôs not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I‚Äôm a coward, I couldn‚Äôt end the pain of living so I have to live like you‚Äôre half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn‚Äôt cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I‚Äôm still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that‚Äôs a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly.

If you were feeling so low that you felt suicidal then you were clearly dealing with a lot. I‚Äôm sorry you were going through that but I admire you for speaking so candidly about it on here and for being able to voice a desire to live. Im sure it feels like a slow journey but as you say, you are moving forwards and that‚Äôs great.

It's not always easy to talk about our darkest thoughts, but it's clear that you're in a better place now and that's something to be proud of.

I love what your friend said - it's not cowardice, it's bravery. It takes a lot of courage to keep going when things seem impossible, and it sounds like you're doing just that. It's okay that you're not living fully right now, but the fact that you're crawling and moving slowly is a huge accomplishment.

Remember that small steps can lead to big changes. Maybe reading a book or trying something new will be the spark that helps you start living more fully. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, just take things as they come and be kind to yourself.

You're not alone in this, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging your progress, no matter how small it may seem. Keep smiling in the dark, and know that there are people here who care about you and are rooting for you.","

poqvsn,Anxiety,Booked my COVID vaccine for tomorrow. Could someone reassure me I‚Äôm doing the right thing?,danisomi,"My anxiety has been a living nightmare lately. The talk of vaccines and Covid has also been mentally draining me, and I feel so scared. 

I finally booked my vaccine, because I know I need to pick between this vaccine or this illness. 

As a mom, I feel I need to be strong and I need to vaccinate myself to limit the spread. 

I have so much health anxiety lately. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to have an anxiety attack and think the symptoms of anxiety are side effects of the vaccine. 

I just need reminders and reassurance I‚Äôm doing the right thing. That I‚Äôm going to be okay and still be able to be a mom. 
I‚Äôm such a mess right now. These thoughts are so intrusive. 

I am hoping once I receive it, and side effects go away, that I will feel better. I hope I will feel protected and more safe. 
I just want a break from this anxiety.",969,200,1631715061,"5.7 billion doses have been distributed globally. If these vaccines were even remotely dangerous, we'd be facing a health crisis much, much worse than COVID itself.

You may not have any symptoms at all.  If you do have symptoms, you'll get through them in the moment, instead of anticipating the worst.  You may experience profound relief at finally being in it instead of having to think about the imminent experience of being in it.  

You can do it and it will be OK!",301,withbellson,"I totally get it, and I'm so proud of you for taking this step despite your anxiety. It's amazing that you're prioritizing your health and your family's safety. 

Firstly, it's completely normal to feel anxious right now. The uncertainty and constant talk about COVID can be overwhelming. But here's the thing: you're not alone, and you're doing the right thing. The vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has been proven to be safe and effective.

When it comes to the potential side effects, it's true that some of them might mirror anxiety symptoms. But remember, these side effects are usually mild and short-lived. And if you do experience any discomfort, it's a sign that your body is responding to the vaccine and building immunity.

You got this, momma. You're strong, capable, and doing your best. That's all anyone can ask for. Take some deep breaths, remind yourself of your reasons for getting vaccinated, and know that you're taking a huge step towards protecting yourself and your loved ones. You're going to be okay, and you're going to be an amazing mom through all this.","

fv6vhu,Anxiety,Corona killed my anxiety,meowie91,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement.

It's like we've learned to look beyond the surface level and understand that everyone's battles are different, but equally valid.

I want to add that I think this community does a great job of acknowledging that healing and growth are not always linear. We don't always have to 'overcome' our struggles to be worthy or strong. Sometimes, just showing up and existing in the midst of chaos is enough. And I think that's something that this community acknowledges and supports really well.

Here's what I've learned to tell myself: taking care of my health is part of being a responsible employee. If I'm too sick to function, I'm not doing anyone any favors by showing up. And trust me, your boss has probably been in a similar situation before.

When I need to call off, I try to focus on the facts ‚Äì ""Hey, I'm not feeling well and need to take the day to rest"" ‚Äì rather than apologizing profusely or making excuses.

liavx4,Anxiety,Anyone gets anxiety because of their anxiety?,Apolloniese,I feel like I get anxiety or panic attack because I'm scared of those feelings.

I don't know if this is a common feeling for those with anxiety disorder but I think it's exactly how I feel.,1069,96,1613136027,"I feel the same way. My brain gets scared and convinces myself I‚Äôm getting worse, but that thought is the thing making it worse. It‚Äôs like an endless cycle.",85,lilkadunis,I can say that's exactly how I feel :),2,LeviPanhavath,"I completely understand what you're going through. This phenomenon is often referred to as ""meta-anxiety"" ‚Äì anxiety about having anxiety. It's incredibly common, and it can create a vicious cycle that's tough to break.

One thing that might help is to practice self-compassion when you start to feel anxious. Instead of beating yourself up over the fact that you're feeling anxious, try to acknowledge and accept those feelings. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way, and that it's not a reflection of your worth as a person.

Another strategy is to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about future anxiety attacks. Mindfulness techniques can be really helpful for this. Try to ground yourself in your surroundings, focus on your breath, and let go of worries about what might happen next.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people with anxiety disorders struggle with meta-anxiety, and there is hope for managing it. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it might take some time to figure out what works for you. But with patience and self-compassion, you can learn to break the cycle.","

I totally get it, having to interact with people when you're not feeling up to it can be really overwhelming. These machines can be a game-changer for people with anxiety or social anxiety. It's not just about avoiding human interaction, but also about feeling more in control of the situation.

If you don't mind me asking, what made you decide to take the plunge and order by yourself this time? Was it the machine that gave you the confidence to do it? Either way, I'm really proud of you for taking that step, and I hope it's the start of many more independent adventures.","

I know it might seem like a small thing to some people, but when you're struggling with depression and anxiety, getting through the day can be a monumental task. The fact that you were able to push through and take care of yourself like that is a huge accomplishment.

It's amazing that you're acknowledging and celebrating this small win - that's exactly what you need to do when you're fighting mental health battles. Those tiny victories might feel insignificant, but they're actually a sign that you're getting stronger.

Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to conquer everything at once. Just focus on the next small goal, and then the next, and before you know it, you'll be looking back on this tough time and thinking, 'I did it.' Keep pushing forward, and know that you're not alone in this fight.""","

I think part of the problem is that some doctors might not fully understand the complexity of anxiety or how it impacts their patients. Or, they might be trying to simplify the issue, but it comes out as insensitive.

If you feel like your concerns are being dismissed, it might be worth seeking out a second opinion or finding a doctor who specializes in mental health.

I don't know how that is for you?",2,kinkyroze,"""Hey OP, I totally get what you're talking about. I've experienced those dreaded 'anxiety hangovers' many times, and they can be just as debilitating as a physical hangover. The brain fog, fatigue, and general feeling of being 'off' can be really tough to shake.

For me, it's often a result of my body's stress response system going into overdrive. When we're anxious, our body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can leave us feeling drained and exhausted once the anxiety subsides.

One thing that helps me is to prioritize self-care the day after a big anxiety episode. I take it easy, stay hydrated, and try to get some gentle exercise (like a short walk) to help clear my head. I also make sure to practice some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help calm my nervous system.

Remember that you're not alone in this feeling, and it's not just 'in your head.' It's a real physical response to stress and anxiety. Take care of yourself today, and know that it's okay to take a day to recover.""","

9a7dpv,Anxiety,I‚Äôm so proud of myself. I just started college. I‚Äôm a week in. I haven‚Äôt had friends to talk to in person in years.

Even in high school and my hometown I never had any friends to talk to in person. For years I was alone and only had a few online friends.. 

I‚Äôm so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I‚Äôm just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It‚Äôs amazing and I had a great night. I‚Äôm so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing.

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She‚Äôs really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You‚Äôre all amazing!**

**Update 3:** **I‚Äôm beginning to worry I‚Äôm gonna make them hate me. I feel like I‚Äôm so annoying..

I move in 3 days from now for my freshman year. Hope everything goes well for the both of us,92,jensreddit12,"I can totally relate to the anxiety and self-doubt that comes with forming new connections. It's amazing that you took the leap and started talking to that group, and it sounds like they're really wonderful people.

I've definitely been in your shoes, overthinking every interaction and worrying that the other person is going to lose interest. But here's the thing: it's normal to feel that way, especially when you're not used to having in-person friends. It doesn't mean you're annoying or clingy - it just means you're excited and eager to nurture these new relationships.

One thing that might help is to set aside dedicated time to hang out with your friends, like you did last night, and then try to focus on other things during the rest of the week. This can help you avoid overthinking and give your friends space when they need it. And remember, it's okay to not be constantly in touch - it's actually healthy to have some space and independence in friendships.

Keep being your awesome self and enjoying this new chapter in your life - you deserve it!","

5tm37a,Anxiety,Telling somebody with anxiety to stop worrying is like telling somebody with epilepsy to stop having a seizure.,iWishPizzaWasHealthy,Saw this quote today and it needs to be shared.,1083,75,1486915246,"I have heard this several times before and I just want to say this out loud for once rather than stifle it, let's call it an exercise in fighting my anxiety about how poorly it will be received.

I have epilepsy and anxiety.  I deal with both on a daily basis, they are both powerful beasts that can take similar forms but that are inherently distinctly different.  One key difference is this: anxiety is a cognitive function that can be harnessed and controlled; epilepsy is a biological process that, in most cases, cannot be halted through sheer willpower.  I view it like being trapped in a metal room - with anxiety, the door has heavy resistance and at times seems impossible to open; with epilepsy the same door is locked, barred and spot-welded shut.

Please don't get me wrong, anxiety can be crippling and is a severe widespread problem that should not be treated lightly.  My battles with both have been exhausting, but respectively very different.  These experiences have taught me one extremely important difference between the two:  anxious thoughts *must* must be faced to overcome anxiety, seizures do not have to be faced to overcome epilepsy.


To anyone out there with anxiety - you are not a victim, this sucks but you are not condemned to a life of these attacks/episodes.  You *can* pull yourself out of thought-spirals, overwhelming anxious thought, etc.  Maybe not this moment, maybe not next week or next year, but you can and with enough determination will do it.  Please don't compare yourself as someone who has a condition that can only really be managed with medication, it's not true and not fair to yourselves in your fight against anxiety.

Once again, it is not my intent to cause controversy, rather to vent a bit and clear some misconceptions.  I believe in you all and wish you peace and strength in your battles to come.",212,ElmoNeedsAmmo,"You have a point, but that doesnt mean we should lash out at someone who tells us to stop worrying. It doesnt automatically make them a mental illness denier or anything.. Sometimes having someone there who cares enough to try and assure you that it'll be okay can be enough to feel okay, and it doesn't matter if theyre right or wrong about the dynamics of anxiety. ",19,MrGCar,"""Love this quote. As someone who's struggled with anxiety, I can attest to how invalidating it feels when people tell you to 'just relax' or 'stop worrying.' It's like they think you're choosing to be anxious, rather than being overwhelmed by your own thoughts and emotions.

For those who may not understand, anxiety is not something you can simply 'snap out of.' It's a complex mental health condition that requires patience, understanding, and support. If you're struggling with anxiety, know that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

To those who want to support loved ones with anxiety, here's a tip: instead of telling them to 'stop worrying,' ask them how you can help them feel better. Listen to their concerns without judgment, and offer to help them develop coping strategies. Sometimes, all someone needs is someone to validate their feelings and offer a supportive ear.

ie3uac,Anxiety,"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.",throwaway06601,"Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

It's exhausting and takes away from your ability to enjoy the good moments.

First off, it's amazing that you're acknowledging this pattern and willing to seek help. That's a huge step. Since in-person therapy is tough due to office closures, have you considered online therapy? It might not be your first choice, but it's better than nothing, and many therapists are now offering virtual sessions.

One thing that might help is to practice reframing your thoughts. When you start catastrophizing, try to challenge those thoughts by asking yourself if they're based in reality. Remind yourself that you've been taking care of your health and that you're doing everything you can. It's not about ignoring the potential risks, but about not letting them consume you.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious. You're not alone in this, and it's not a sign of weakness to admit that you need help. Keep pushing forward, and don't give up hope that things will get better.","

POST TITLE: Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.

POST BODY: Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on. Thank you to each and every one of you.

It takes an incredible amount of courage to continue a conversation when your mind and body are screaming to escape. 

I can only imagine how daunting it must have been, but it sounds like your coping mechanism of sipping water helped calm you down. It's amazing that you were able to find a way to manage your anxiety in the moment.

It's even more impressive that you're recognizing this as a 'big win' for yourself. That self-awareness and willingness to challenge your past behaviors is a huge step forward. It's clear that you're committed to growth and overcoming your anxiety.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's awesome that you're taking ownership of your mental health. Keep celebrating those small victories, and don't be too hard on yourself when things don't go as planned. You're doing great, and it's inspiring to see you push through those tough moments. Keep going!","

8z20x2,Anxiety,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,MightyJoeTYoung,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I‚Äôm surviving and doing things that make me happy?",1067,87,1531664426,"It's really a shame that the current system makes us feel that way. I'm pretty sure most people feel like that. The thing is, you need to know what you personally value and then act according to those values. Do you value success more than holistic living? Do you value money more than happiness? Do you value work more than creativity? You should prioritize your values according to your preference. Then you won't be so doubtful about the path you chose for yourself.

It's like you've finally caught your breath after years of struggling, and now you're feeling the pressure to 'level up' again. I've been there too - it's like your mind is always pushing you to do more, achieve more, even when you've already made significant progress.

Firstly, congratulations on getting your life back on track and finding a comfortable routine. That's no small feat! Now, about this anxiety... I think it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to take a break and enjoy the fruits of your labor. You've earned it.

However, I also understand the fear of stagnation. One thing that might help is setting smaller, achievable goals for yourself. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the thought of going back to school, try breaking it down into smaller steps - like researching courses, talking to people in your desired field, or even just dedicating an hour a week to learning something new.

Remember, it's not about constantly pushing yourself to be more; it's about finding a balance between growth and self-care. You got this, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out.","

Your post really resonated with me, and I'm grateful you shared your perspective on anxiety. I also struggle with anxiety, and I've found that acknowledging and accepting it as energy, like you mentioned, can be incredibly helpful. It's almost like giving it permission to exist, allowing yourself to process it, rather than trying to suppress or deny it.

I love how you emphasized paying attention to the physical sensations in your body and exploring the underlying causes. That mindfulness approach has really helped me too. It's not always easy, but it's a powerful way to take control and reduce anxiety's hold.

Thanks for sharing your wisdom and reminding us that we're not alone in this. Sending you positive vibes and hoping you have an amazing day! Keep spreading the love and good energy.""","

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the impact your job has on your mental health, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the patterns that lead to your anxiety.

First, let's debunk the idea that you're ""running away from your problems."" Taking care of your mental health is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength. It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your well-being, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Rather than beating yourself up over calling in sick, try to focus on what you can do to move forward. Have you considered talking to your boss about how you're feeling? It might be helpful to set boundaries or discuss ways to make your workload more manageable.

Remember, you're not defined by one day or one decision. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep taking care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.","

POST TITLE: I skipped work today due to my anxiety and now I'm so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever done the same thing?

POST BODY: My job makes me pretty depressed.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?

sf1p75,Anxiety,Does anybody else gets instant diarrhea from high anxiety/panic?,TheTroubledChild,"As soon as my anxiety spirals a bit too high I get diarrhea in an instant, it doesn't even have to be a full blown panic attack. It's one of the main reasons I'm isolating myself so much because I'm scared I can't always get to a toilet fast enough, if at all (like in cars). It's also not just one run of diarrhea, it can be like an ordeal of 2 or 3 runs to the toilet. I'm really not comfortable to have these ""diarrhea runs"" at a friends or family house, as they usually get quite concerned once I start running, wondering if they did something that made me sick. I honestly don't know how to go on with life when literally every tiny disturbance of my ""isolation-routine"" aggravates my overall anxiety that much. Does anybody else deal with something like that? Or overcame it?",1018,132,1643406584,"Yeah I used to have that happen with severe anxiety. 
In some people the fight or flight response signals the body to eliminate waste in the bowels. 
Getting enough fiber in your diet  to be on a very regular schedule of daily bowel moments helps.",157,paparandy61,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get it. The connection between anxiety and digestive issues is real, and it's not uncommon for people to experience digestive problems during periods of high stress. The 'gut-brain axis' is a real thing, and when you're feeling anxious, your body can react in some pretty uncomfortable ways.

Firstly, know that you're not alone in this. There are others out there who are going through the same thing, and it's not something to be ashamed of. It's understandable that you're feeling isolated, but maybe try reaching out to friends or family and explaining what's going on? They might be more understanding than you think, and it could actually help you feel more at ease in social situations.

In terms of managing your anxiety and its effects, have you looked into relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness? These can help you calm down in the moment and reduce your overall anxiety levels. It might also be worth talking to a healthcare professional about your specific situation and getting some personalized advice. You don't have to deal with this on your own.","

It feels like you're living with a constant, low-grade hum of anxiety in the back of your mind. I've been there too. It's like your brain is always 'on,' waiting for the other shoe to drop. First of all, just know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people experience it, and it's okay to acknowledge and validate those emotions.

One thing that might help is to try to break down what's causing that fear and unease. Is it a specific situation, a general feeling of uncertainty, or something else? Once you can pinpoint the source, you can start working on addressing it. It might also be helpful to establish a daily routine that brings you comfort and calm ‚Äì whether that's exercise, meditation, or something else entirely.

Another thing that's helped is establishing a relaxing Sunday evening routine. Whether it's reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some light yoga, I try to unwind and calm my mind. It's not about avoiding the feelings, but about learning to coexist with them.

I've been there too - cruising on a high, and then suddenly, this nagging voice in the back of my head starts whispering 'but what's the catch?' or 'when's the other shoe gonna drop?' It's like, you're waiting for the universe to balance out the good vibes with some bad news.

First off, know that you're not alone in this. It's actually a pretty common phenomenon, especially for people who've experienced trauma or anxiety in the past. Our brains can get wired to anticipate the worst, even when things are going well.

Here's what helps me: when those thoughts creep in, I remind myself that I'm not a fortune teller, and I don't have control over the future. So, instead of getting caught up in 'what ifs,' I try to focus on the present moment and what I can control. Mindfulness practices, like meditation or deep breathing, can also help calm that anxious voice.

Just remember, OP, you deserve to enjoy the good times without sabotaging yourself with negative thoughts. The universe isn't out to get you ‚Äì sometimes, things just go well, and that's okay.","

I used to feel the same. ,42,lifesjustaroad,"I totally get it. Mornings can be brutal, especially when anxiety kicks in. I've been there too - waking up feeling like I've been hit by a truck, with my heart racing and zero motivation to face the day. It's like your brain is already in overdrive, and getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain.

Firstly, it's great that you've identified a pattern - that you usually start feeling better after getting up, eating, and hydrating. That's a good starting point. One thing that might help is to set super small, achievable goals for yourself in the morning. Like, just get out of bed and stand up for 5 minutes. Or, take a few sips of water. Sometimes, breaking it down into tiny steps can make it feel less overwhelming.

Also, have you considered a morning routine that's gentle and calming? Maybe some light stretching, or a short meditation session? It might help to ease you into the day. Remember, it's okay to take it slow and be kind to yourself. You're not alone in this struggle, and it's amazing that you're reaching out for support.","

It's awesome that you're deciding to face your fears head-on, even if it's just a 5-minute walk to the park.

First of all, kudos to you for being aware of your body's limits and acknowledging your fears. That takes a lot of courage. Now, I'm not a medical professional, but if you're concerned about passing out, you might want to consider taking some precautions - like bringing a water bottle, having a snack beforehand, or even having a buddy with you (if that's an option).

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. You don't have to push yourself too hard, especially if you're not feeling 100%. The fact that you're willing to try is what matters. You got this, and we're all rooting for you! Keep us updated on how it goes.","

- Muscle tension, aches and pains, weakness, cramps, painless muscle twitches, jaw clenching
- Chest pain or racing heart, heart palpitations, pounding heart, audible heartbeat
- Temporary hair loss, particularly on the crown of the head (telogen effluvium)
- Body-focused repetitive behaviors - skin/scab picking, lip/nail/cheek biting, hair pulling, bouncing of legs or wringing hands, tapping fingers, fidgeting, etc.
- Fatigue, exhaustion, irritability, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness or trouble with memory, insomnia, nightmares or trouble sleeping, frequent sleep disturbances
- Headaches, dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, sweating or shaking
- High blood pressure
- Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
- Hot flashes or chills, feeling overheated or very cold
- Nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, frequent urination, stomach or digestive problems including diarrhea and constipation

Just need a PCP or psychiatrist to evaluate you for anxiety disorders now.",189,larki18,[deleted],20,[deleted],"I totally get why you'd be surprised by the diagnosis. I mean, who expects to be told their scary symptoms are 'just' anxiety? But honestly, it's really common for anxiety to masquerade as physical symptoms, especially when it comes to the heart. It's like your body is trying to send you a message, but it's using the wrong language.

It's great that you went through the tests and got a clean bill of health, though. Now you can focus on addressing the anxiety. Have you thought about talking to a therapist or counselor? They can help you develop some strategies to manage your anxiety and reduce those physical symptoms. Exercise, meditation, and deep breathing can also be super helpful.

It's not a 'just' - anxiety is a real thing that can have a huge impact on your life. But it's also something you can work with and learn to manage. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

About 11 years late compared to everyone else my age, but I finally have my license

First of all, let me say that I'm so glad you're reaching out and talking about your feelings. That takes a lot of courage. It's clear that you're not looking for a magic cure-all, but rather a change of scenery that might help you feel more grounded and at peace.

If you're seriously considering making a move to Hawaii (or somewhere similar), I'd encourage you to start exploring what that might look like in a practical sense. Research the cost of living, job opportunities, and what kind of lifestyle you could realistically expect. It might not be easy, but it could be a chance to start fresh and find a sense of purpose. Remember that you deserve to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being.","

Firstly, I want to acknowledge how brave you are for sharing this with us. It can't be easy to talk about those feelings, but I hope you know that you're not alone. Many people struggle with dark thoughts, and it's a testament to your strength that you're working through them.

It's also beautiful to see you recognizing the shift in your emotions. You're right to feel excited and happy about these small accomplishments ‚Äì they're a reminder that you're capable of growth and change. Keep holding onto those positive feelings, and don't be too hard on yourself when the tough days come (because they will come).

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's amazing that you're taking that first step. Keep moving forward, and know that you've got people here who care about you and want to support you.""","

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. 

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?",974,162,1517962487,"Oh my God, yes. Especially the dread phrase, ""We need to talk.""",178,41mHL,"Oh my God, yes. Especially the dread phrase, ""We need to talk.""",178,41mHL,"I totally get it, OP. That feeling of being 'in trouble' or constantly on edge can be really draining. It sounds like a classic case of rumination, where your brain starts replaying the day's events and picking apart every little thing.

First of all, just know that you're not alone in this. Many people with anxiety experience similar thoughts and feelings. One thing that might help is to establish a 'shutdown ritual' for when you finish work or classes. This could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or doing some light stretching. The idea is to signal to your brain that the day is over and it's time to relax.

When those anxious thoughts start creeping in at bedtime, try to challenge them by asking yourself if there's any real evidence to support them. Often, we can talk ourselves into feeling guilty or worried over nothing. Remind yourself that you did your best, and that's all anyone can ask for.","

It's like you're observing your anxiety from the outside, and that self-awareness can be really confusing. I've had similar experiences, where I feel like I'm 'watching' my anxiety unfold, and it's hard not to wonder if I'm somehow 'faking' it.

Here's the thing: just because you're aware of your anxiety doesn't mean it's not real. It's actually a sign that you're more in tune with your emotions than you might think. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to focus on what your anxiety might be trying to tell you. What's triggering it? What can you do to calm yourself down?

It might also help to reframe your thinking around your anxiety. Instead of seeing it as a 'performance,' try to view it as a signal that you need to take care of yourself. You're not seeking attention; you're seeking relief. And that's okay. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're not alone in this feeling.","

Morning anxiety can be overwhelming, and it's like your brain is already in high gear before you've even had a chance to process the day ahead. I've been there too, and it's really tough to shake off that feeling of dread.

One thing that's helped me is establishing a gentle morning routine. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but starting small can really make a difference. For me, it's just taking a few deep breaths, stretching, and getting some natural light exposure before checking my phone or getting out of bed. It's not about tackling the day head-on right away, but rather giving myself a gentle nudge towards a more positive start.

I'd also recommend exploring some relaxation techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation or a short meditation session, to help calm your nervous system. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace, and it's not about 'getting over' your anxiety, but about learning to coexist with it in a more manageable way. You're not alone in this, and I hope you find some comfort in knowing that.","

There are days when even the thought of small talk feels like climbing a mountain, and it doesn't matter if it's with your favorite person or a stranger. It's like your social battery is completely drained, and you just can't muster up the energy to care about the weather or how someone's day was.

Firstly, know that you're not alone in feeling this way. It's actually pretty common, especially during difficult weeks or periods of stress. It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own emotional well-being.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, try setting some boundaries for yourself. It's okay to say no to social invitations or tell someone you need some alone time. You can also try to find ways to recharge, whether that's through exercise, meditation, or just binge-watching your favorite show.

Remember, it's not about being antisocial or not caring about others; it's about taking care of yourself. And honestly, sometimes that means taking a break from conversations and just being alone. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

It's amazing how long it can take us to learn that we have the power to calm our own minds.

I think it's beautiful that you're acknowledging how hard this journey is, but also how empowering it is. It's like, every time you're able to talk yourself down from an anxious spiral, you're building a little more confidence in your own ability to cope.

For me, a helpful trick has been to practice self-compassion, not just when I'm feeling anxious, but also when I'm feeling like I've 'failed' at managing my anxiety. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to need a little extra time to work through things.

Also, it might be helpful to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to not have all the answers. Your brain is probably just trying to protect you from potential threats, but sometimes that can lead to unnecessary stress.

POST BODY: Like, right now I feel like there's something I should be worrying about and it's killing me, it's driving me nuts, and it's keeping me on edge because I don't know what it is and I honestly just want to flip every table I see.

This happens like ALL THE TIME and sometimes I hope my brain is just normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies! It made me realize that I'm not alone and that there are other people who experience the same thing I'm experiencing right now and it made my day, thank you!

I hope you all have a good day!

&amp;#x200B;

(Hopefully me editing this post won't make offend anyone and I'm sorry if someone happens to get offended by it. I just wanted to express my gratitude)

ch08i6,Anxiety,DAE get nervous to return to work or school after you've been away for a little while?,GloomyBaby4,"For me, it doesn't seem to matter how comfortable I am somewhere (though it is worse at newer/less familiar places), but if I get sick or something and skip a few days of class or work, I get really anxious to go back.

I got back from traveling with my boyfriend and today was my first day back to work...,62,pillowsandblankets4,"I totally get what you're going through. It's like your brain is already preparing for the worst-case scenario, making it hard to shake off those anxious feelings. I've been there too, especially after being out sick - it's like you're worried that you're not fully recovered and that's going to cause more problems.

Here's something that might help: take things one step at a time. Instead of worrying about the whole day or week, focus on just getting to work and making it through the morning. You can always reassess and adjust as needed. Also, remind yourself that it's okay to not be 100% right away. You're not expected to bounce back instantly.

Lastly, try to reframe your thinking - instead of thinking ""I'm going to get worse"" or ""I'm not ready,"" tell yourself ""I've taken the time to rest and recover, and now I'm ready to get back to it."" You've got this, and you can always take it one step at a time. Hope you feel better soon and that your return to work goes smoothly!","

j1jlbq,Anxiety,Be kind to yourself.,Soulofapoet-,The war within yourself knows no peace when you keep feeding the enemy.,1076,45,1601323214,Thank you . Kind stranger .,64,rrrrrryyy124,What does this mean,5,[deleted],"I completely get what you're saying. It's like there's this constant battle going on in our minds, and sometimes it feels like we're our own worst enemy. I think it's so important to recognize when we're feeding into that negativity and self-criticism. It's like, we're already struggling, and then we add this extra layer of guilt and shame on top of it.

One thing that's helped me is to try to approach myself with the same kindness and compassion that I would offer to a friend. If a friend was going through a tough time, I wouldn't beat them up over it, right? I'd listen, I'd offer support, and I'd remind them that they're doing the best they can. So, I try to do the same for myself. It's not always easy, but it's a good starting point. Remember that you're not alone in this, and it's okay to be kind to yourself, even when it feels like you're not doing enough.","

I literally feel heightened with the need to clean and put things back. The mess is at the forefront of my brain and it's like I am not able to function until everything is tidy and neat. I feel overwhelmed by it all.",1042,79,1595553584,Sometimes I get into such bad anxiety that my room becomes a mess which makes me more anxious but I‚Äôm too anxious to clean it...its a vicious cycle,127,best_jessxo,"Yes. And the three people I live with have far less qualms about clutter than I do, so I end up having to clear surfaces and put stuff away just to calm my anxiety.  I don't like that because then I build resentments because, ""why can't you all just pick up after yourselves?"" builds up until that is almost as big as a problem as the original anxiety from the clutter every where.

Maybe this is me throwing a pity party, but why is it that those of us with anxiety have to adjust to everyone else because of our anxiety instead of other people making small accomodations for us?

Edit: like sometimes I just want to yell, ""I shouldn't have to take Zoloft to keep from turning into a controlling asshole just because of everyone's lack of motivation to clean up after themselves and deal with their own shit!""",6,ScooterTheBookWorm,"Hey OP, I completely feel you. I'm a total neat freak, and clutter can really get to me too. Renovations can be especially tough, since it's like your whole routine is turned upside down.

First of all, just know that you're not alone in this feeling. Research actually shows that clutter can increase cortisol levels and impede cognitive function, so it's not just you being ""picky"" ‚Äì it's a real thing!

That being said, I've found a few strategies that help me cope with the mess. First, try to break it down into smaller tasks. Instead of looking at the whole room and feeling overwhelmed, pick one area or task to focus on at a time. Also, remind yourself that this is temporary ‚Äì renovations do end eventually!

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to not have everything perfect right now. Take a few deep breaths, and try to focus on the end result ‚Äì a beautiful, renovated home that's all yours. Hang in there, you got this!","

Congrats",104,Shadow6553,"Huge congratulations to you for taking that step and asking to pet someone's dog. I totally get why that might be a big deal for you - social anxiety can be really tough to navigate.

It's also worth noting that asking to pet someone's dog is actually a pretty great conversation starter. It shows you're interested in connecting with others and willing to take the initiative. And who knows, it might just lead to more conversations and connections in the future.

Remember, it's okay to start small and work your way up. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't feel like you're making progress as quickly as you'd like. Every little bit counts, and it sounds like you're on the right track. Keep being kind to yourself and taking those small steps - you've got this!","

How do you get past this stuff?",1051,68,1529116969,"Yes.

I read elsewhere on reddit that if you cringe at a memory, it means you learned something. Most of the stuff you cringe at, no one else would likely remember.

I feel some pity for the person I was, remember what I learned, maybe if I did better subsequent circumstances, and try to just move on to completely different memories.",189,4CatDoc,,0,,"I totally get it, and I'm here to tell you that you're not alone. It's like our brains have this weird ability to replay our most cringe-worthy moments on repeat, no matter how many years have passed. 

First off, let's acknowledge that it's actually pretty normal to still think about past experiences, especially the ones that made us feel embarrassed or anxious. It's like our brain is trying to process and learn from those moments, even if we think we've long moved on.

One thing that might help is to try and reframe those memories. Instead of beating yourself up over what you did or didn't do, try to focus on what you learned from those experiences. What skills or strengths did you develop as a result of those challenges? How have you grown and changed since then? Focusing on the positives can help shift your perspective and make it easier to let go of the negative emotions.

Also, remind yourself that everyone has embarrassing moments, and nobody is judging you as harshly as you're judging yourself. You're not the same person you were 10-20 years ago, and that's something to be proud of.","

I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency.

It sounds simple, but it can really help shift your perspective.

Also, have you considered trying some small, low-stakes interactions to build your confidence? Like, strike up a conversation with a cashier or say hi to a neighbor. It's not about trying to make friends right off the bat, but just getting used to being around people without feeling overwhelmed.

I usually have the tendency to anticipate the worst possible outcomes, too so that usually leads to me being even more anxious. However, I recently had one of my ‚Äúworst possible outcomes‚Äù actually materialize and found that despite my anticipation I wasn‚Äôt ready for it (I always assumed that the anticipation was preparing me in some sense for the worst possible outcome). I guess the moral of the story is that anticipation is pointless lol",174,skrrtmion,I was diagnosed with GAD and the doctor told me that the result of that was that my brain attempts to anticipate every possible situation ahead of time which in turn leaves my brain just perpetually exhausted and over stressed.

For me, it's like my brain is constantly playing out different scenarios, trying to prepare for any eventuality. But at the end of the day, it's exhausting and often takes away from the present moment.

One thing that's helped me is to acknowledge when I'm getting caught up in anticipation mode. I take a step back, breathe, and remind myself that I can only control my own actions and reactions. The rest is outside of my control. It's not always easy, but it's helped me to focus more on the present and less on hypothetical scenarios.

It's also worth considering that trying to anticipate everything can be a form of anxiety management. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to explore some relaxation techniques or talk to someone about what's going on. You're not alone in this, OP, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

ldb1h3,Anxiety,Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.,[deleted],"I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (&lt;3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets.",977,138,1612543056,"I'm sorry you feel this way, I understand that feeling of ""not having lived my life"" I too feel the same sometimes, at 28.

I hope you find something that is worth living for, no matter how little. (At the moment it is books and pilates for me)

Dm me if you ever want to chat!
My best wishes",191,ilikecats1007,"I can feel the weight of your regret and anxiety through your words. It takes immense courage to acknowledge and share your struggles, so thank you for being vulnerable. I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with feelings of inadequacy and ""catching up"" in life.

Firstly, please acknowledge that your circumstances, though challenging, don't define your worth or potential. It's amazing that you've made it this far, and that's something to be proud of. Your GAD diagnosis and therapy journey show that you're actively working on yourself.

Rather than focusing on what you haven't done, try to reframe your perspective on what you can start doing now. Break down your goals into smaller, achievable steps. You can start taking swimming lessons, or practicing driving with a licensed instructor. You can also start building your professional network and exploring part-time or freelance work to gain experience.

Remember, it's never too late to start living the life you want. You have 26 years of life experience, and that's a foundation to build upon. Don't give up on yourself ‚Äì you have so much potential and time to make a change.","

POST TITLE: Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.

POST BODY: I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (&lt;3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets.

Thanks for asking, friend.",9,littlebirdbluess,"Hey OP, I totally feel you. I've been there too, and it can be really frustrating and embarrassing. Anxiety can indeed cause an increase in urination, and it's not just because you're drinking more water. It's actually due to the body's 'fight or flight' response, which can affect your bladder and kidneys.

What helped me was learning some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. It might sound weird, but it actually made a big difference. I also started keeping a 'pee journal' to track when I was peeing and how much I was drinking, which helped me identify patterns and triggers.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be a real pain (literally!), but there are ways to manage it. Have you talked to a doc about your anxiety and peeing issues? They might be able to help you figure out a plan to reduce your anxiety and, subsequently, your peeing.

Hang in there, and don't be afraid to reach out for support.","

Your realization that you don't know those people and will probably never see them again is a great one. It's a reminder that we often worry about what others think, but in reality, they're probably too busy with their own lives to even notice.

I think this experience can be applied to so many other areas of life - doing things that make you happy, even if they might seem ""weird"" to others. So, keep embracing that mindset and remember, it's okay to enjoy life's simple pleasures, even if that means getting ice cream by yourself. You do you!","

The past year. I went to a new job in hi-tech. I left my previous company of (10) years where I was successful. The new company basically set me up up fail from day one with a module that had been oversold 2 years ago and the previous rep had left. So I come in and am gas lit and told everything you are doing is correct. Then the pandemic hits and soon departments and head count are being laid off. 

Then 2 weeks ago the company does a wide layoff and now people are getting coaching plans. I cannot focus, ive lost 15 pounds, i have no energy but I cant sleep and I am stuck in this constant obsessive loop of worry. I wish I could simply focus on today but my mind wont let me. The fact we are in this pandemic only heightens everything. I have the weight of my family, our home, our benefits - i feel nauseous a lot which makes me have no hunger.

It sounds like a really tough weekend, and I can imagine how overwhelming those panic attacks must have been. It's completely understandable that you didn't feel up to going to work today.

First of all, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people experience physical symptoms like nausea, sweating, and a general feeling of being unwell when they're struggling with anxiety and depression. It's like your body is responding to the emotional distress.

Take care of yourself today, okay? Allow yourself to rest and recover. If you can, try to do some gentle self-care activities that usually help you feel a bit better ‚Äì whether that's reading a book, taking a warm bath, or just lying down in a quiet space. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to 'get better' right away; just focus on getting through the moment.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help if you need it. If you feel like you're struggling to manage your anxiety and depression, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a support hotline for some extra guidance and support.","

I've learned that it's essential to focus on progress, not perfection. Instead of beating yourself up over the bad days, try to acknowledge the good weeks you had and remind yourself that you're still moving forward. It's not a linear process, and it's okay to have setbacks.

Also, take it one day at a time, and don't put too much pressure on yourself. Remember to practice self-care, especially on the tough days. Reach out to friends, family, or a support group if you need to talk it out. You're not alone in this, and there are people who understand what you're going through.

Try not to put too much pressure on the outcome. Instead, focus on how you feel about the experience. You should be proud of yourself for taking that risk. Remember that her response (or lack thereof) doesn't define your worth.

If she does text you, great! If not, it's not the end of the world. You'll survive, and you might even learn something from the experience. Take a deep breath, relax, and try to enjoy the uncertainty. You got this.","

When you go back to work, try not to worry too much about what your trainer thinks. They've probably been in your shoes before, and they might even be more understanding than you think.

If you're new to weed, it's also a good idea to have a trusted friend or two around who can help calm you down if needed.

It's a very weird mix.",183,thr0w4waii,wait this is me! what helps you to enjoy going out?,6,lyssland,"I completely get what you're saying, OP. It's like there's a constant battle between the ""real you"" and the anxiety-ridden self that often takes center stage. I've had similar experiences where I've surprised myself by being more outgoing or confident in certain situations, and it's like, ""Wait, who is this person?!""

It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a dissociation between your authentic self and the anxious persona that's been shaped by traumatic experiences. It's totally possible that your anxiety has become a learned coping mechanism or a response to past trauma, but that doesn't mean it defines your true personality.

One thing that might help is to try to tap into that ""real you"" more often. What are some situations or activities that make you feel confident and carefree? Try to replicate those feelings and environments as much as possible. Also, remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious, and it doesn't mean you're not being your authentic self. You're just working through some tough stuff. Keep pushing forward, and I'm rooting for you!","

mkkdkv,Anxiety,Just overheared my parents calling me dumb for not getting over my anxiety yet.,RoboticMonarch,"I went downstairs to drink water and I overheard my parents saying that I'm dumb for still having anxiety and it would be solved if I went outside more.
My parents seem to think that I am inexperienced and if I simply went outside more and stopped caring my anxiety would magically go away.

I'm sure the only reason I have anxiety in the first place is because of them.

They like to say all of my problems are ""anxiety"" and ""being bored"" and they think I was pretending to have depression because I'm able to laugh.",988,118,1617628350,Aaand this is precisely why I never told my parents a thing lol. I'm so sorry. They're idiots. You're not. I wish I could hug you.,421,larki18,[removed],-3,[deleted],"I'm so sorry you had to overhear that. It's incredibly hurtful and invalidating, especially when it comes from the people who are supposed to support you. 

Firstly, please know that anxiety isn't something you can just 'get over' by going outside more or pretending it doesn't exist. It's a legitimate mental health condition that requires understanding, patience, and often professional help. 

It's also not uncommon for people with anxiety to be able to laugh or appear 'fine' to others, but that doesn't mean they're not struggling. It sounds like your parents might benefit from educating themselves on mental health.

If you feel comfortable, consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents about how their words affect you. If not, prioritize your own well-being and seek support from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.

Remember, you're not alone, and your anxiety is valid.","

I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can‚Äôt afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can‚Äôt afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won‚Äôt allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts.

First of all, huge kudos to you for tackling that assignment and getting your paperwork done. That's a massive accomplishment, and it's awesome that you're feeling more positive about it. Now, about that living situation - I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, toxic environments can be really draining. But I love that you're brainstorming ways to make it more bearable. That's a great first step.

As for your dad, I can only imagine how tough it must be to deal with his health issues on top of everything else. It's amazing that you're focusing on one or two things at a time and trying to stay positive.

is6wza,Anxiety,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,golddust89,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn‚Äôt see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn‚Äôt right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It‚Äôs so fucked up. I can‚Äôt describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn‚Äôt see my partner anymore. I didn‚Äôt have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don‚Äôt know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren‚Äôt the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I‚Äôve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I‚Äôll try to respond to you all later today.",1034,72,1600031623,"Hey, I don't have some wise words, but I want to say I'm sorry this happened.  That feels scary and violating.  I'm really glad you and your partner are not hurt and the perpetrators were arrested.   

I've been burglarized twice and robbed once (I was once burglarized because I frequently left my door slightly cracked for my cat!).  It's scary, and there's no way around that.  

Overall, it sounds like the situation went really well.  I would probably need to address my fears with a therapist, but please know that from what you wrote you reacted well -- in that in the end, no one got hurt.  I am sorry that you felt the very real fear when your parter went after them.  I may have felt more comfortable letting the stuff go than going after the culprits, which was riskier.  

This may be silly to say, but I didn't get burglarized again once I kept my door closed.  Also, generally, generally, generally speaking, burglars are often opportunists and do not want to actually hurt people.  

Take care of yourself!  Do something you enjoy today - spend time with your partner if you can.",211,poofbecomingfit,"It sounds like you might be experiencing some ptsd? It definitely sounds like a traumatic event, even if things worked out okay in the end your brain may still be trying to process it all. I am sos sorry. Virtual hug! Therapy or even just talking it all over with your partner might help. 

What I really wanted to suggest was maybe a cat door? That way you can keep your doors locked but still let kitty in and out.",36,lilbrie,"Oh man, I can only imagine how traumatic that experience must have been for you and your partner. It's completely normal to feel stressed and anxious after something like that, especially when your home and sense of security have been violated. 

First of all, kudos to your partner for being brave and resourceful in chasing after the thieves and getting some of your stuff back. And what a weird twist with the electric steps and the red backlight - it's almost like something out of a movie.

As for your fears, I think it's great that you're acknowledging them, even if some of them might seem irrational. It's natural to worry about what could happen next. One thing that might help is to focus on what you can control - like taking extra precautions to secure your home, or talking to your partner about how you can work together to feel safer. It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. They can offer you some guidance on how to process your emotions and work through your fears. Remember that you're not alone in this, and you're doing the best you can.","

9o5kkd,Anxiety,Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?,annacuppiecake,"Even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. And if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.

I remember there was a day where I was late to everything. I remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

What can you do to make being late ok? I know it's not a big deal to those around me if I am a few mins late, but I feel horrible about myself. ",1002,104,1539545401,Yup....this is a huge trigger for me. I hate being late. I think it is because growing up my family was always late to stuff. ,176,mintgreen23,,0,,"I totally get where you're coming from. Being late can be a huge source of anxiety and frustration, especially when you're someone who values routine and punctuality. It's like your whole day gets thrown off, and it's hard to shake off the feeling of being 'behind.'

Firstly, acknowledge that it's okay to have those feelings, but also remind yourself that being a few minutes late isn't the end of the world. It's not a reflection of your worth or capabilities. It's just a minor setback.

One thing that might help is to build some buffer time into your daily schedule. So, if you're worried about being late to an event, try leaving 15-20 minutes earlier than you think you need to. This way, you'll have some wiggle room in case things don't go exactly as planned.

Lastly, practice some self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone has off days, and it's okay to not have everything under control all the time. Take a deep breath, and try to reframe being late as a minor inconvenience rather than a catastrophe.","

Just when you think you‚Äôre safe it sneaks out and gets you.",129,SherbetAdmirable39,"I totally get what you're going through. It's like your mind is saying, ""Hey, things are going great, let's go ahead and worry about all the things that could go wrong."" It's frustrating, to say the least.

One thing that might help is recognizing that this anxiety could be a sign of your mind trying to prepare for the unknown or potential future threats. It's like your brain is in ""hypervigilance mode"" even when everything is fine. 

Try this: when you start feeling anxious, take a step back and acknowledge the feeling. Then, gently remind yourself that you're safe and that everything is okay in the present moment. Focus on your breath, engage in an activity you enjoy, or practice some grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the here and now.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious sometimes, and it doesn't mean that you're not allowed to enjoy your day. Be kind to yourself, and try to find a balance between being mindful of your anxiety and not letting it consume you.","

....I...hate my brain.",2,uhhcrentist,"I totally get it, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's like anxiety has a way of hijacking our rational thinking and taking us on a wild ride of worst-case scenarios. That 'what if' game can be especially brutal.

One thing that's helped me in similar situations is to remind myself that my anxiety is not a reliable narrator. When those crazy thoughts pop up, I try to acknowledge them, but also challenge them by asking myself if they're based in reality. It sounds like your anxiety is trying to convince you that your friends are being paid to be friends, but is that really something that's likely to happen?

It might also be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or a therapist about these thoughts. Sometimes just sharing them out loud can help you gain some perspective and realize how irrational they are. Remember that you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep in mind that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to ask for help.","

I think it‚Äôs because I feel more pressure to fit in with people my age, so I feel like I gotta change who I am to fit in with them. But with older people, I feel like I can just be who I am. Idk how to change that tho lol",283,Idkwhogivesaf,"I totally get what you're saying. I've experienced something similar, and it's like there's this strange disconnect between how I interact with people in a professional setting versus social situations with peers.

One thing that might be contributing to this anxiety is the pressure to fit in or be relatable with people in your own age group. When you're around older people, there might be less expectation to be part of a certain social circle or have similar interests.

In terms of solutions, have you tried to pinpoint what specifically is causing your anxiety in these situations? Is it fear of judgment, feeling like you don't belong, or something else? Once you have a better understanding of what's driving your anxiety, you can start working on ways to address it.

Also, it might be helpful to remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay around people your own age. You don't have to be best friends with everyone you meet, and it's perfectly fine to have different social circles or interests.","

It can be overwhelming to feel like your mental health is always at the forefront, especially during a time like Halloween when people often use costumes to poke fun or draw attention to certain issues.

First off, kudos to you for acknowledging your feelings and wanting to take a break from that narrative. If you're looking for a costume idea that celebrates mental wellness without being too on-the-nose, you could consider dressing up as someone who embodies positivity, resilience, or self-care. Think of a character who radiates confidence, calmness, or joy ‚Äì maybe someone like a yoga instructor, a gardener, or even a favorite fictional character who promotes mental well-being.

Remember, your mental health is valid, and it's okay to take a step back and focus on the positives. You do you, and don't feel pressured to explain or justify your costume choice to anyone. Have fun, and happy Halloween!","

qx61ov,Anxiety,Do you still drink coffee despite of having anxiety?,KornyChiwa_-,"Even though they said to avoid caffeine when you have anxiety, I still love drinking coffee in the morning and my day is not complete without having one.",722,381,1637288981,"Caffeine addict here, I feel like nothing will ever relieve me of my torment so I just have this mindset of whatever.",280,OfficialKGB98,I work graveyard and had to come off coffee and switch to tea.  Coffee sent me into a tailspin.,37,Lamarraine3,"Hey OP, I totally get it - coffee can be a hard habit to break, especially when it's such a big part of your daily routine. I've struggled with anxiety myself, and while I know the general advice is to avoid caffeine, I've found that it's all about balance and self-awareness.

For me, it's about being mindful of how much coffee I'm drinking and when. I try to limit myself to one cup in the morning, and I make sure it's not too close to bedtime. I've also started experimenting with decaf or half-caf options, which can be a good compromise.

It might be worth exploring what triggers your anxiety and whether there are other factors at play. Maybe it's not just the coffee, but the combination of coffee and something else. Keep in mind that it's not about cutting out coffee completely, but about finding a balance that works for you. Don't feel guilty about enjoying your morning coffee - just be aware of how it's affecting you and adjust accordingly.","

That quote really puts things into perspective, but it's one thing to intellectually understand it and another to actually put it into practice. I've been there too, where I know I'm worrying about something that might not even happen, but my brain just won't let go.

One thing that's helped me is to acknowledge my worries, but then challenge them by asking myself what I can actually control in the situation. Sometimes, it's just a matter of accepting that some things are outside of my control, and that worrying isn't going to change the outcome.

It might also be helpful to try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in hypothetical scenarios. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can be really helpful for this. Remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's not about suppressing your emotions, but about learning to navigate them in a way that doesn't consume you. You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're acknowledging your worries and seeking support.","

It's like having a constant companion that you can't shake off, no matter how hard you try.

First of all, let me just say that it's okay to feel this way. It's normal to have moments where anxiety gets the better of you, and it doesn't mean you're weak or flawed. It just means you're human, and you're struggling with something that's really tough to deal with.

One thing that might help is to try to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about the future or dwelling on the past. Mindfulness can be a game-changer for anxiety, and there are tons of free resources online that can help you get started.

Also, don't be afraid to reach out for support. Talk to a friend, family member, or mental health professional about what you're going through. They can offer you a fresh perspective, some helpful coping strategies, and a listening ear.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to help. Hang in there, and don't give up. You got this.","

I've experienced something similar, and I've found that for many people, nighttime anxiety can be linked to a few factors. 

One reason might be that the world outside our windows gets quieter and darker, which can amplify our internal thoughts and make them feel more overwhelming. Another possibility is that our routines and distractions during the day (like work, school, or daily activities) keep our minds occupied, but as the evening winds down, we're left alone with our thoughts.

What's helped me is establishing a calming pre-bedtime routine ‚Äì think reading, meditation, or a warm bath. It signals to my brain that it's time to unwind and relax. I also try to challenge my nighttime thoughts by reframing them in a more positive or realistic light.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with nighttime anxiety, and it's not a reflection of your ability to cope. If you feel comfortable, you might want to explore some relaxation techniques or talk to a mental health professional for more personalized guidance.","

owodyh,Anxiety,I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,desertpancake,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes.

It's incredibly frustrating and hurtful to realize that the people who were supposed to support and care for you missed the signs of your struggles. It's like they were supposed to be your safety net, and they dropped the ball.

First of all, acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's okay to be angry, and it's okay to grieve the lack of support you needed as a child. However, it might be helpful to try to separate your current anxiety from the past. Instead of beating yourself up over what happened, focus on the progress you're making now. You're seeking help, and that's a huge step.

It's also important to remember that people often don't know what they don't know. Your parents and teachers might not have had the knowledge or resources to recognize and address your anxiety. That doesn't excuse their lack of support, but it can help you understand that it wasn't necessarily malicious.

Lastly, be kind to yourself and focus on your healing journey. You're taking control of your life, and that's something to be proud of.","

POST TITLE: I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child

POST BODY: This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.

Then I‚Äôm laying in bed contemplating whether to get up or hide from the world lol.,112,RetroRealities,,0,,"""Ugh, I feel you. It's like anxiety is saying, 'Hey, you thought you had a few more hours of sleep? Think again!' I've been there too, and it's so frustrating. One thing that helps me is having a gentle morning routine that signals to my brain that it's okay to wake up and start the day. This might sound silly, but I set my alarm 10-15 minutes earlier than I need to, and use that time to just breathe, stretch, and slowly get out of bed. It's helped me transition from 'anxiety wake-up mode' to a more peaceful morning.

Also, I've noticed that when I prioritize self-care the night before (e.g., meditation, journaling, or a warm bath), I tend to wake up feeling more centered and less anxious. It's not a magic cure, but it can help. Hang in there, friend. You're not alone in this, and I hope you have a better rest of the week too""","

As an introvert, I've always cherished my alone time, and lunch is no exception. I used to feel guilty about eating by myself, like I was missing out or something was wrong with me. But honestly, it's been a game-changer for my mental health.

It's amazing how much of a recharge you can get from just having some quiet time to yourself. No small talk, no forced conversations, just you and your thoughts. I've started to look forward to my lunch breaks, and it's become a highlight of my day.

If anyone gives you weird looks or makes you feel like you're awkward for eating alone, just remember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs. You're not hurting anyone by taking some time for yourself. In fact, you're probably making yourself a more energized and focused person for the rest of the day.

So, keep on enjoying those solo lunches ‚Äì you do you!","

c05zqf,Anxiety,I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,whutamievendoing,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.",972,124,1560433447,"I am so sorry for your loss, but please understand that no eight year old could ever possibly be expected to care for a child.

It's incredible that you're still in therapy and working through your emotions - that takes a lot of courage.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that what happened was a tragic accident, and not a deliberate act. You were 8 years old, and it's not fair to put the weight of adult responsibility on a child. It's essential to separate the incident from your self-worth.

It's also crucial to recognize that your mother's words, although well-intentioned, might not be enough to heal the wounds. It's possible that she's still grieving and struggling to come to terms with the loss. Her feelings don't define your worth, and it's not uncommon for family relationships to be complex.

Remember that you can't change the past, but you can work towards a more compassionate and forgiving present. Be patient with yourself, and try to focus on the progress you've made so far. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you deeply.","

I think what people mean by 'comfort zone' is often misunderstood. It's not about being constantly uncomfortable and anxious, but rather about challenging yourself to grow and learn in a way that feels manageable and safe. For people with anxiety, that might mean taking tiny steps outside of what feels comfortable, but still acknowledging and respecting your limits.

It's amazing that you're speaking out about this, and I hope it helps others understand that 'comfort zones' can look very different for people with anxiety. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. Keep sharing your perspective, and thank you for being brave enough to do so!","

One thing that's helped me is to try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worst-case scenarios. When you start to feel that anxiety creeping in, take a step back and remind yourself of all the times when people have responded positively to you. It's also helpful to try to reframe your thinking - instead of assuming people secretly hate you, try to consider the possibility that they're just busy or distracted.

Lastly, remember that people who are worth having in your life will like you for who you are, imperfections and all. Try to be kind to yourself and focus on building relationships with people who make you feel good about yourself. You got this, and you're not alone in feeling this way.","

Its uncomfortable letting go of our thoughts and letting action guide us , but it‚Äôs the only way forward. This is a more elegant way of just saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù.",983,107,1618788580,"Agreed. The Flow philosophy, stoicism, and optimistic nihilism are some of the philosophies that help fight anxiety by directly contradicting and negating it. If you are willing to lose and willing to give up, there is nothing to torment you with. 

The moment you decide to take control and fight, wham bang, it's back.

Takes a little faith (not religious) in the universe, but there are ways to logically justify such faith.",135,nojox,"Completely agree - one method I employ when anxiety hits is to just let it hit me.

I think what you're touching on is the concept of ""radical acceptance"" - accepting that there are things beyond our control, and that's okay. It's not about giving up or saying ""fuck it,"" but rather about surrendering to the present moment and focusing on what we can control, which is our own actions and reactions.

It's not easy, I know. It takes practice and patience to let go of the need for control and trust that everything will work out. But it's a game-changer. By letting go of that need for control, we can start to break free from the cycle of anxiety and live more in the moment.

nlq59n,Anxiety,Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting?,chocearthling,"I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again.... 

How are you guys handling going back to some form of ""normal"" or ""before""?",952,138,1622059480,"I felt so anxious over a year ago when this all started. Then I got comfortable in my bubble. Restrictions lifting made me anxious, everything returning to normal makes me anxious, the thought of taking a vacation that I really need is making me anxious. On top of all that I‚Äôm doing my best to find a job before my unemployment is over, and I‚Äôm having no luck. I also have a soon to be five year old to send to school in September and that‚Äôs making me anxious as well‚Ä¶..so let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm not  doing too well :(",164,Potential-Reason-763,"Masks have become comforting in an incognito sort of way. They hide my wonky teeth &amp; the occasional cold sore, plus nobody can see me talking to myself.",31,Rscamp1981,"I totally get it - it's like the world outside your comfort zone is suddenly moving at a breakneck pace, and it's overwhelming. I think it's amazing that you've been able to identify your triggers and have been managing your anxiety well, but it's also understandable that the thought of stepping back into the unknown is causing anxiety to creep back in.

Firstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's normal to feel apprehensive about readjusting to a more social, pre-pandemic life. It might be helpful to start small - take tiny steps out of your comfort zone, like meeting a friend for a walk or grabbing coffee in a quiet spot. Gradually build up to more social interactions, and prioritize your physical and mental well-being along the way.

Remember, it's not about forcing yourself to go back to 'normal' immediately, but about finding a pace that works for you. Take care of yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you need to slow down or take a step back. You've got this, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out.","

Anxiety attacks can be so convincing, it's like having a constant 'breaking news' ticker in your brain that's just spewing out worst-case scenarios 24/7. But hearing from a neurologist that it's all in your head (literally) can be a huge relief. It's like, finally, someone is telling you that your brain's 'fake news' isn't real.

I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share this, and I'm glad you're starting to feel more comforted by the truth. One thing that might help is to remind yourself that your brain is just trying to protect you ‚Äì it's like an overzealous alarm system that's just trying to keep you safe. But sometimes, that alarm system gets a little too trigger-happy.

Next time you feel an anxiety attack coming on, try to take a step back and remind yourself that your brain is just spinning tales. It's not reality, and you're safe. You got this. Keep reminding yourself of the neurologist's words: ""you're fine.""","

p5rmw7,Anxiety,People don't understand what anxiety is,[deleted],"People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

All wounds will heal with time but it sucks we have to go through this terrifying traumatic experience.",914,176,1629155856,"People with no anxiety disorders are really annoying some times because they just don‚Äôt get it, they say things like bro just relax, or I have anxiety too, I was having that exam and didn‚Äôt study and was really worried or stuff like that, they don‚Äôt get that I can‚Äôt relax because from the moment I wake up I feel like shit from anxiety, when they say just relax it drives me mad, like if I could just relax I would",262,gekonto,"People with no anxiety disorders are really annoying some times because they just don‚Äôt get it, they say things like bro just relax, or I have anxiety too, I was having that exam and didn‚Äôt study and was really worried or stuff like that, they don‚Äôt get that I can‚Äôt relax because from the moment I wake up I feel like shit from anxiety, when they say just relax it drives me mad, like if I could just relax I would",262,gekonto,"I completely get it, and I'm so sorry you're going through this.

The physical symptoms you mentioned, like tight muscles and weakened immune system, are often overlooked, but they're a huge part of the anxiety struggle.

It might sound simple, but just acknowledging that you're not alone in this can make a difference. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to need time to work on yourself every day. I think it's amazing that you're advocating for more focus on anxiety in the medical world - it's a conversation that needs to be had.

I thought this wasn't possible but I guess people feel the same way wtf. I don't know how to deal with it to be honest, I just get chest pains and anxiety symptoms even when I literally have nothing to stress about, it's pretty dumb.",39,HasanVinsmoke,"I totally get what you're describing - it's like your body is on high alert, even when your mind is chill. I've been there too. It's really frustrating when your body seems to have a mind of its own.

One thing that might help is to acknowledge that this feeling is real, and it's not just you being paranoid or overreacting. It's possible that your body is picking up on subtle stress signals that your mind isn't consciously aware of. Maybe try to tune in to your physical sensations and see if you can identify any patterns or triggers.

Another thing that's helped me in the past is some gentle physical release - like going for a walk, doing some yoga, or even just some deep breathing exercises. It's like my body needs to shake off that excess energy.

Remember, you're not alone in this feeling. And it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your physical comfort. Take care of yourself and try to find some calm in the midst of that crawly feeling.","

hk5rud,Anxiety,I‚Äôve started therapy for my anxiety,WearALotOfBlue,"I just wanted to tell someone, just anyone.

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i‚Äôm doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope.

I love your edit about therapy and medication - as a medical student, you're in a unique position to offer valuable insights. Your point about finding the right therapist is especially important, and I appreciate you emphasizing the importance of trust and faith in the process.

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and focus on your healing journey. You don't have to put on a brave face or pretend everything is fine when it's not. You're doing the work, and that takes a lot of courage.

Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out to this community whenever you need support or just someone to talk to. We're all rooting for you!","

I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way. So many people struggle to reach out for help, and it's often the bravest ones who take that first step. Remember that therapy is a sign of strength, not weakness.

As you start this journey, be gentle with yourself and try not to put too much pressure on the process. It's okay to take things at your own pace, and it's normal to feel a little uncertain at first. But just showing up and being willing to work on yourself is half the battle.

I'm driving back to uni tonight and I'm only there for 3 nights as it's a short week and my anxiety is through the roof. I felt like I couldn't breathe yesterday.

It's normal to feel apprehensive, especially with the added stress of dealing with a bully teacher and students. I want you to know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with anxiety when returning to an environment that's caused them distress in the past.

Here's what helped me in a similar situation: take small steps to prepare yourself for the transition. Tomorrow, focus on getting through the first day, and then take it one day at a time. Break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Also, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor about what you're going through. They can offer valuable support and help you develop a plan to cope with the bullying.

Remember, your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel scared. But you've made it through tough days before, and you can do it again. Take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being. You got this.","

For anyone who might be feeling discouraged or alone, your story is a reminder that it's okay to take your time and focus on your own well-being.

As someone who's also had their fair share of anxiety, it's like my brain is constantly running in the background, even when I'm trying to relax. I think it's helpful to remember that ""normal"" is just a social construct, and everyone's brains work differently. 

From what I've gathered, people who don't struggle with anxiety often have more of a ""default mode"" where their brains can just kind of... chill. They might think about their day, their plans, or just observe their surroundings without overanalyzing everything.

One thing that's helped me is practicing mindfulness and trying to focus on the present moment. It's not about stopping your thoughts completely (because let's be real, that's impossible), but more about learning to observe them without getting caught up in the analysis. It's like watching clouds pass by instead of trying to control the weather. It might take some time to get the hang of it, but it's worth a shot. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

It's amazing that you recognized your needs and weren't afraid to speak up. I can totally imagine how frustrating it must have been to have your mom speak for you, but it's great that you took control of the situation.

It's so important to prioritize your mental well-being, especially when you're not feeling your best. Taking those two days off in a row will hopefully give you the rest and relaxation you need to recharge. Remember that it's okay to ask for help and support - it's a sign of strength, not weakness.

Also, kudos to your scheduler for being understanding and accommodating. It's not always easy to find supportive work environments, so that's definitely a plus.

Keep being proud of yourself and take care of your mental health. You got this!""","

While surgery might not be an option (and I'm glad it's not, because you are so much more than your anxiety), there are other ways to find relief. Have you considered therapy, specifically something like DBT or CBT? These types of therapy can help you work through your thoughts and emotions, and develop coping strategies that might make a big difference. Additionally, mindfulness practices like meditation or yoga can help calm your mind and body.

It's not about ""getting rid"" of your anxiety, but learning to live with it in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming. You are strong and capable, and you've already made so much progress. I believe in you, and I'm here to support you.","

er2fjs,Anxiety,I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,ghetto_oldsoul,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

&amp;nbsp;


**Edit** : Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time to write a beautiful comment! I am really blessed and I'll never forget that! I hope  my story encourages you to reach out to people. You're not alone. Again, thank you so much :)",1035,46,1579468520,"That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm happy your family was there for you. Some parents usually tell their kids to ‚Äújust get over it‚Äù but it fills my heart with joy that your parents are actually trying to help you. :,D ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",114,Stoofles24,"You're so lucky and I'm so happy for you!
I'm 17 too. My family not that supportive :/  Once I told mom that I wanna go to a psychologist and she looked at me like I'm crazy, and my dad was very disappointed :/

I hope everything will go well for you!! Stay strong! ‚ù§",1,nerdforeverrrrrr,"I just wanted to say that your story truly warmed my heart. It's amazing how something as simple as reaching out for help can bring about such a profound change in your life. It's clear that your family cares deeply about you, and it's beautiful that they're making an effort to be more present and supportive.

I can imagine how hard it must have been for you to open up to your dad, especially given your history of feeling uninvolved. But it's a testament to your strength and courage that you did. It's also lovely to see how your little brother is looking out for you - siblings can be such a source of comfort and love.

Your story is a great reminder that we don't have to face our struggles alone. Reaching out for help takes courage, but it can be a game-changer. I'm so glad you're feeling more supported and loved, and I hope your story inspires others to do the same. Keep spreading the love and positivity!","

s4nn4g,Anxiety,Does anyone wake up hours before alarm because you are anxious about something that next day?,[deleted],"Happened to me today!

Barely slept and still had 3 more hours to sleep but my body noped out of that and woke me up.

What am I supposed to do with those 3 hours???

Worry more???

Wtf body I hate anxiety.",992,84,1642263158,"Anxiety is the most successful alarm clock for sure, it's awful but I'm never late for anything lol",130,The-Invalid-One,,0,,"I'm so familiar with that dreaded 3am wake-up call. It's like your brain decides to stage a rebellion against sleep and anxiety takes over. I feel you.

First, take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way. Your body is responding to stress, and it's not uncommon for our brains to go into overdrive when we're anxious about something.

As for those 3 hours, try not to worry more (easier said than done, I know). Instead, use this time to do something calming and relaxing. Grab a warm drink, read a book, listen to soothing music, or do some gentle stretches. Sometimes, a change of scenery can help shift your focus away from anxiety.

Remember, you can't control your anxiety, but you can control how you respond to it. Take small steps to calm yourself down, and try to reframe your thoughts. Tell yourself that you've got this, and that you'll face whatever is causing your anxiety head-on. You're not alone in this, and many of us have been there too.","

ia7nas,Anxiety,Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,[deleted],"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels &amp; frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time &amp; we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)",968,107,1597499322,"Oh yes. No news is good for anybody‚Äôs mental health though, because ‚Äònews value‚Äô is usually based on triggering our lizard‚Äôs brain obsession with danger.

I've had to set boundaries with news consumption too, and it's not about being ignorant or uninformed, but about self-care and mental health. The 24/7 news cycle can be overwhelming, and it's great that you're recognizing your limits.

Firstly, please don't feel guilty about taking a break from the news. It's okay to prioritize your well-being. Instead of feeling obligated to stay up-to-date, try to focus on the things that bring you comfort and joy, like your knitting and learning Irish.

It might also be helpful to set specific times when you do catch up on news, so it's not constantly in your face. And when you do engage with news, try to stick to reputable sources to minimize the stress of wondering what's true and what's not.

Your friend's conspiracy theories can be especially challenging, but it's okay to set boundaries there too. You don't have to engage in conversations that make you feel uncomfortable or anxious. Remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary.","

I've definitely been there, especially when anxiety is running high. It's like our brains are searching for some kind of escape or distraction, and mindless scrolling can be a tempting numbing agent.

Here's the thing: it's not about beating yourself up over it, but about recognizing the pattern and finding ways to break it. When you catch yourself scrolling, take a deep breath and ask yourself what you're really looking for. Are you trying to calm down, or avoid something?

Try replacing phone time with other self-care activities, like taking a short walk, journaling, or practicing some gentle stretches. Even a few minutes of something more intentional can help shift your mood. Remember, it's okay to not be productive all the time, and it's okay to take breaks. But being more mindful of how you're spending your time can help you feel more in control and less anxious. Keep in mind, small changes can add up over time.","

Try this: next time you're tempted to add a ""lol,"" take a deep breath and ask yourself if it's really necessary. If not, hit send without it. Your messages will still be received as friendly and respectful. And if someone does misinterpret your tone, that's on them, not you. You're not responsible for how others perceive your words.

It's amazing that you're recognizing the triggers and acknowledging that it's not just about your past experience, but also about the daily stressors like exams and school.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this. Many people experience anxiety that manifests physically, and it's not a sign of weakness. It's a sign that your body is responding to stress, and it's trying to protect you.

In terms of managing your anxiety, have you considered some relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization? These can help calm your body and mind before a stressful event. Also, try to reframe your thinking around your upcoming exam and school in general. Instead of thinking ""I have to put in double the effort,"" try to focus on what you've accomplished so far and what you're capable of.

Remember, you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.","

POST TITLE: does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?

POST BODY: about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn‚Äôt breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn‚Äôt worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it‚Äôs over now and i‚Äôm with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven‚Äôt been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that‚Äôs coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks.

fyg254,Anxiety,Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?,Skerivo,"My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach. When I become really anxious (for no reason just because), I'll become nauseous (along with other symptoms). Except, while most people are scared of vomiting, I'm petrified. I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop. It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?",961,111,1586526229,"My anxiety is connected to my stomach but I also have IBS so when I get anxious I get nauseous and have mild to severe stomach pains (as well as eating certain foods). If I'm doing something out of my comfort zone I always have to rush to the toilet. 

Throwing up makes me scared but fortunately I take comfort in the fact I haven't thrown up in years",81,DryTeaStain,"I have the same issues. My advice would be to seek help asap. The longer it goes on, the harder it is to end this terrible loop. Any stomach issues or chest pain throw me into horrible panic.",13,rae2176,"I completely understand what you're going through - it sounds like a vicious cycle that's really tough to break. I also experience anxiety tied to my stomach, and while my fear of vomiting isn't as intense as yours, I can empathize with that sense of panic.

One thing that might help is to acknowledge that your fear of vomiting is valid, even if it's irrational. Sometimes, just recognizing and accepting our fears can make them feel less overwhelming. You might also want to try some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help calm your body and mind when you start to feel anxious.

It's also worth considering talking to a therapist about your anxiety and potential phobia. They can help you develop coping strategies and work through your fears in a safe and supportive environment. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who can help you break the cycle. Keep in mind that it's okay to take things at your own pace, and don't be too hard on yourself - you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

nbey4x,Anxiety,I finally stood up to my housemate.,canthackthecraic,"I've been in a pretty rotten housing situation for a year or so now. 
My two housemates (a couple) fight and scream alot, and generally are disrespectful of the fact that they share the space with other people (ie my boyfriend and I).
After being woke up to the sound of screaming again this morning, I finally stood up to my housemate and told her that she woke me up and that I was upset. She's famously combative so she tried to argue with me but for once, adrenaline kicked into my system in a useful way and I didn't back down. 
Ive been really anxious lately and struggling personally so I'm really proud that I managed to speak my mind.

Power to you for speaking up for yourself!,132,captaincocoabear,"""Hey OP, huge kudos to you for standing up for yourself in that situation. I can only imagine how draining it must be to deal with that kind of tension in your home, especially when you're already struggling personally. It's amazing that you were able to channel your adrenaline into a productive conversation instead of letting it overwhelm you.

I think it's really important to acknowledge that setting boundaries and asserting yourself doesn't mean you're being confrontational or aggressive - it just means you're taking care of yourself. Remember that you deserve respect and a peaceful living environment, and it's okay to advocate for that.

If you don't mind me asking, how are you feeling now after the conversation? Was there any resolution or compromise reached, or is it still a bit of a tense situation? Either way, I'm here to offer support and solidarity - you got this!""","

It's like, your brain just goes into overdrive and starts playing all these worst-case scenarios on repeat. I've been there too, and it's exhausting.

One thing that's helped me is to try to reframe those thoughts when they start creeping in. Instead of thinking ""everyone hates me,"" I try to tell myself ""I'm feeling anxious, and that's okay."" It sounds simple, but it can really help shift your perspective.

Also, it might be helpful to remind yourself that people are usually too caught up in their own stuff to be thinking about you. Like, your coworkers are probably worried about their own projects and deadlines, not judging you.

It's great that you're recognizing these feelings and talking about them. That takes a lot of courage. Just know that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep talking, and don't be afraid to reach out when you need help.","

mjk0hm,Anxiety,my coworker recognized that I have anxiety,missdundermifflin,"I just started a job working at Dairy Queen as a cashier (this is my third day). I don‚Äôt make the food, I take orders and money, bring/give food to people, and clean up the store/restock when needed. today, I messed up an order. me and four of my coworkers were standing in a circle trying to figure out the confusion, when I, using my classic dry humor to cope, said ‚ÄúOh my God I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack now‚Äù. One of my coworkers said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, breathe in, breathe out‚Äù. Later, she came up to me and asked if I had anxiety. I said yes, I‚Äôve had it since I was 7. She said to let me know if anything was ever overwhelming me, and she would help me out. it‚Äôs honestly one of the sweetest things anyone has ever said to me.",1034,37,1617492617,"This melted my heart. I‚Äôd never have the guts to tell my boss something like this. 

Actually, had a panic attack while eating lunch one day 6ft away from him. Didn‚Äôt say a damn word. Just found 3 things to look at SLOWLY, 3 things to smell and 3 of my favorite things, (I like that movie üòÇ). 

Proud of you.",159,CassMayy,"Next time try using gum as it keeps your brain from engagement of fight or flight response, another technique to consider is breathing slow and deep, hold your breath for 3 seconds and exhale. The reason for this is because your beginning to hyperventilate, which causes your body to not be able to get the oxygen needed in your blood, holding your breath shortly allows the oxygen to be absorbed. Also you should be drinking water everyday but 3 to 4 bottles is enough per day. Drinking too much can lower your electrolytes, also no good for anxiety. Just a little advice I learned and that helped me. üôÇ",14,SeaworthinessCalm713,"That's so beautiful to hear that your coworker was understanding and supportive. It's not often that people acknowledge anxiety in such a kind and non-judgmental way. It takes a lot of courage to share your anxiety struggles with someone new, especially in a work setting, so kudos to you for being open about it.

It's also amazing that your coworker offered to help you out when things get overwhelming. Having a supportive team can make a huge difference in managing anxiety at work. Don't be afraid to take her up on that offer if you need to - it's okay to ask for help, and it's clear that she's willing to provide it.

Remember that it's okay to make mistakes, like with the order, and that it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities. You're still getting used to the job, and it's normal to have slip-ups. Take a deep breath, and know that you've got a supportive coworker who's got your back.","

Firstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's great that you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to break free from it. One thing that might help is to practice mindfulness and grounding techniques. When you start to feel anxious, try to focus on your five senses ‚Äì what you can see, hear, smell, taste, and feel in the present moment. This can help calm your mind and bring you back to reality.

Also, I love that you're determined to focus on good things, even if you feel like you don't have any right now. That's a great attitude to have!

I think it's amazing that you're recognizing the toll this pressure is taking on you and that you're acknowledging your emotions. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to not have all the answers.

I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

Edit: seriously so thankful you all have been leaving so many nice comments :') (and even gave me a gold?? Thank you!) I may not respond to everyone but I am surely reading every comment and am beyond appreciative!",940,126,1591419082,"People don‚Äôt understand how exhausting , irritating, and scary anxiety can be. I‚Äôm glad we have this platform to connect and write how we feel without judgement. You are not alone. I‚Äôm going to list a few things that help me and I hope you can try. 

1. Peppermint oil. (Roller ball form sold at target for 4.99) put it directly on temples, neck wrist. I love to roll on tissue and smell. The scent really does soothe and calms me down. I can‚Äôt be without. 

2. Finding a game on your phone or YouTube videos on something you like that can distract you. Have a list of saved videos you can watch when you are feeling a panic. 

3. Ice pack. I put one on my neck or just hold it the sensation helps to calm. 

4. Staying hydrated. Drinking cold water when I‚Äôm feeling anxious also helps a little. 

5. Fresh air. If I‚Äôm too anxious for a walk I will sit on my balcony, and listen to music/ play a distracting game on my phone.

6. Creating a list of things you need to do. Example cleaning or organizing a closet or drawer etc to keep busy. Even simply washing the Dishes.",312,melg6,"Hey, man. I get it. I deactivated all of my social media except youtube and reddit, but cleaned up youtube and reddit so I don‚Äôt have to see or hear about current events or my friends‚Äô/loved ones‚Äô shitty opinions on current events. I also deleted all my news apps except for My Radar so I can get the weather without everything else.

Still, I‚Äôm extremely stressed out. For this whole week (since Saturday evening), my heart has been racing between 120-160 bpm. I‚Äôve been feeling cold and in need of a thick hoodie and fluffy socks, even though it‚Äôs been between 80-90 degrees F this whole week. I haven‚Äôt slept or eaten. Only tonight have I been able to eat a small meal and a snack. I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of endless ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù and worst case scenarios. It sucks. It really fucking sucks. And, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the same.

I hope it‚Äôs comforting to know that you are far from alone. I know people who never understood what it was like to be anxious until now, when recent events have pushed them over the edge. My dad, perhaps the most stoic, level-headed, intelligent man I know, had a mental breakdown earlier this week and told me about it when I saw him Thursday, and opened up about my experiences. My mom has been a constant ball of anxiety. My grandparents have been full of anxiety. My friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc are full of anxiety. Everyone is losing their fucking minds. 

So, I think it‚Äôs wise to unplug, at least until the weather appears on the front page of the news sites again. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get back to social media shit. If I do, I‚Äôll be coming back in a completely different way. 

It‚Äôs perfectly okay to unplug. It‚Äôs the most commendable thing you can do these days. Sure, some people may get upset at you. But, for the most part, it will be like you never existed online in the first place. So, take care of yourself. Don‚Äôt do what I did, and stay plugged in until you can‚Äôt eat or sleep for five days. Instead, surround yourself with positivity.

Beyond deactivating social media and ignoring the news, get back into a hobby or two. Listen to your favorite music. Work on some art. Read some good books. Listen to some uplifting podcasts. Watch interesting and funny movies. Go for long walks outside. Lift some weights. Learn new things about something you‚Äôve always wanted to know more about. Talk to loved ones over the phone, over skype, and/or in person (if it‚Äôs possible). Get a therapist (if you don‚Äôt already have one). Do whatever you need to do to make it possible to heal.

Healing will take a long time. It won‚Äôt be easy. But, I promise it will get better! Keep on going! With time, you will heal, your friends and family will heal, society will heal, and everything will get back to normal.

We‚Äôre already almost through the first week of June! Woohoo!",95,camohorse,"I just wanted to let you know that your post resonated with me, and I'm so grateful you felt comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings here. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable, especially when it feels like the world is overwhelming you.

First of all, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like you might be experiencing some anxiety and self-doubt, which can be really tough to navigate. One thing that might help is practicing some self-compassion. Try to be kind to yourself, even when it feels like you're making mistakes or overreacting. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that you're doing the best you can.

It might also be helpful to take things one step at a time. Instead of worrying about making ""right"" decisions, focus on taking small, manageable steps towards what you want to achieve. And when you start to feel anxious or like you're ""twisting"" positive interactions into negative ones, try to catch yourself and reframe those thoughts in a more positive light.

Remember that you're not a burden, and people care about you. Keep reaching out for support, whether it's here on Reddit or in your personal life. You're not alone, and things can get better.","

But that is where the disorder kicks in.

Which makes it even more frustrating.",131,Rosemary-Slavic,,0,,"I completely get where you're coming from. It's like your brain has a mind of its own, and no matter how hard you try to rationalize things, the anxiety just amplifies. It's so frustrating to feel like you're being irrational, but at the same time, you can't shake off the feeling of unease.

Here's the thing: it's not stupid. Your anxiety is a real, legitimate response to a perceived threat, even if it doesn't feel that way to you. It's not about being rational or irrational; it's about your brain trying to protect you from what it thinks is a danger.

One thing that might help is to try to separate your thoughts from your feelings. When you start to feel overwhelmed, take a step back and acknowledge your emotions. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel scared or anxious, and that it doesn't mean you're being ridiculous. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep talking about it, and know that you're doing the best you can.","

Celebrate your small wins, no matter how insignificant they may seem. Every tiny accomplishment is a step closer to breaking that cycle. Be kind to yourself, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not losing control, you're just learning to navigate a new path.

I've been in a similar situation, and it's amazing how much emotional weight we can attach to our belongings. It's not just about getting rid of stuff; it's about letting go of memories and emotions tied to those items.

For me, decluttering has been a game-changer for my anxiety. It's not about getting rid of everything, but about creating a sense of control and calm in my living space. When your surroundings feel chaotic, it can be overwhelming and exacerbate anxiety.

One approach that might help is to start small. Begin with one area or category of items that feel manageable to you. For example, you could start by sorting through those old school books or hobby supplies from your parents. As you work through each item, ask yourself if it brings you joy or serves a purpose. If not, consider letting it go.

Remember, it's okay to keep some items that hold sentimental value, but be honest with yourself about whether they're truly bringing you comfort or just taking up space. Good luck, and I hope you find some peace in the process!","

It's like, you're already feeling vulnerable when you mess up, and then someone's reaction just amplifies that feeling. I've been there too, and it's really tough to deal with.

One thing that's helped me is to try to separate my self-worth from the situation. Just because someone's annoyed or upset, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or that I've done something irreparably wrong. It's also important to remember that people's reactions often say more about them than about us.

If you feel comfortable, you could try talking to your friends about how their reactions are affecting you. They might not even realize the impact their behavior is having, and having an open conversation could help clear the air. And hey, if someone's consistently making you feel anxious or bad about yourself, it might be time to reevaluate the friendship. You deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.""","

The pressure to post something 'worthy' can be overwhelming, especially when you're already anxious about sharing your thoughts online. First of all, congrats on breaking the ice with this post - it's amazing how much relief it can bring to just share your feelings.

As for advice, try to reframe your thinking: instead of worrying about what others will think, focus on sharing your genuine thoughts and interests. Your unique voice and perspective are what make Reddit so valuable. Don't compare yourself to others; everyone starts somewhere, and karma isn't the only measure of a successful post.

Lastly, remember that this community is supposed to be a safe space for discussion and connection. If you're feeling anxious, start by engaging with others' posts - comment, ask questions, or simply share your own experiences. You'll build confidence over time, and your voice will be heard. Keep being you, OP, and don't be too hard on yourself.""","

wrus19,Anxiety,My wife tried to kill herself.,masteroguitar,"Last Monday I walked in on my wife taking an excessive amount of very dangerous heart pills. And somehow I was too stupid to realize she wasn‚Äôt joking, she wanted to die. Luckily she was talking to her therapist who made her a Safety plan that I thought was a great idea. I got rid of all the guns in the house, all the pills and all was well. About 4 days later she admitted she had picked a day, a time, and how she was going to do it. Which was yesterday at 9 in the morning with about 150 pills she had hid from me. A few phone calls later she was whisked away to a crisis center. 

Now she‚Äôs gone for I don‚Äôt know how long, no visitors allowed and very little phone contact. 

Since the incident. I haven‚Äôt eaten in 4 days, I have constant panic attacks it almost feels like she did Die, I know it‚Äôs not true and she‚Äôs safe but I‚Äôm so lost I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I‚Äôve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don‚Äôt understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

Update: I want to thank every single one of you that has wrote something for me, it makes me feel so much better knowing someone took time out of their day to give advise or encouragement. As of right now I‚Äôm at my sisters house, it‚Äôs a lot better having an adult to talk to.

I‚Äôve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can‚Äôt see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She‚Äôs doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

Thank you so much everyone you have helped me more than you know. Now the real work begins.",968,92,1660856648,"Do you have anyone you can stay with, like a family member or a friend?

It's completely understandable that you're feeling lost, anxious, and struggling to cope. Witnessing your wife's attempt and the subsequent separation must be incredibly traumatic for you. It's not surprising that the antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds haven't kicked in yet - it's early days, and it might take some time to find the right combination.

It's essential to acknowledge that you're not ""stupid"" for not realizing the severity of the situation initially. It's a difficult thing to process, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to support your wife and yourself. Your love and care for her are evident, and it's beautiful that you're there for her during this challenging time.

Keep leaning on your support system, including your sister and online communities like this one. Remember to take care of yourself, too - eat, rest, and engage in activities that bring you comfort. It's going to be a tough road ahead, but with time, patience, and support, you and your wife can navigate this together. Sending you both love and strength during this difficult time.","

Anxiety can be a real rollercoaster, and it's like, you're just trying to survive the ride, but your brain is over here screaming, ""but what if this is the drop that kills you?"" I've been there, and it's exhausting.

Here's the thing: you're not alone in this fear. It's a common anxiety symptom, and just acknowledging that can be a huge relief. When I'm in that headspace, I try to remind myself that my brain is just trying to protect me, but it's also really bad at risk assessment. It's like, my brain is trying to prepare me for every possible worst-case scenario, but in reality, those scenarios are super unlikely.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on the present moment. Instead of worrying about what might happen, I try to bring my attention back to what's happening right now. It's not always easy, but it can help calm the anxiety beast a bit. Hang in there, friend, and remember that you're not alone on this ride.","

en7g7v,Anxiety,"Anyone else lost the energy to deal with people, like ANY people, even friends?",TheTroubledChild,"My anxiety takes so much energy from me, I avoid people as much as I can, even my friends, even family.

I DO feel lonely sometimes but then imaging someone being around is such an unbearable thought. 
It is NOT social anxiety, I am not scared of people or what they think of me, I just think they're unbearable and I lack the energy to deal with their bullshit. I used to be super extrovert some years ago, it all changed when I developed anxiety. 
I'm in therapy already, but it doesn't help, like at all. I don't wanna live and die like a hermit, but I don't know how to help it.",980,80,1578749596,I feel like this a lot of the time. My social battery is very short and I easily get overwhelmed by conversations,158,coffee_and_tv_easily,"I feel this so much. I used to be an extrovert, now I get overwhelmed by texting.",7,misswyatt,"I totally get where you're coming from. It's like your anxiety has become a constant energy drain, and the thought of interacting with people, even loved ones, feels like too much to handle. I've been there too, and it can be really isolating.

First, I want to acknowledge that it's amazing you're in therapy already. That takes a lot of courage, and it's not always easy to admit when we need help. Since it's not social anxiety, it might be worth exploring other avenues in your therapy sessions, like working on self-care strategies or stress management techniques.

One thing that might help is setting small, achievable goals for yourself. Instead of forcing yourself to go out and socialize, try tiny steps like taking a short walk or meeting a friend for a low-key coffee. It's not about pushing yourself to be extroverted again, but about finding ways to reconnect with others that feel manageable for you. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and take things at your own pace. You're not alone in this, and there's hope for finding a balance that works for you.","

It's really tough to deal with anxiety that's affecting your eating habits, especially when it's hard to shake the feeling that something more serious is going on. I've been there too, and it's a really scary place to be.

First of all, it's great that you've talked to your doctor and they're on the same page as you about the anxiety connection. That's a great first step. Now, I want to suggest that you try to focus on small, manageable meals throughout the day. Instead of trying to eat a big meal and feeling anxious about finishing it, try breaking it down into smaller portions. You can also try eating more frequently, so you're not feeling too hungry or too full at any one time.

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and prioritize your mental health right now. Don't worry too much about the weight loss - just focus on taking care of yourself and finding ways to manage your anxiety. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Hang in there, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support.""","

One thing that's helped me is to try and reframe some of the negative thoughts. Not to dismiss them, but to acknowledge them and then challenge them with a more realistic perspective. It's not always easy, but it's helped me to feel more grounded.

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to reach out for help. Whether it's a therapist, a support group, or a trusted friend or family member, don't be afraid to ask for a hand to hold. And remember that those people who love you? They want to help, even if you feel like pushing them away.

The fear of losing control or 'going mad' is a terrifying prospect, especially when anxiety already has you feeling like you're walking on thin ice.

It's like my brain's 'fight or flight' response has gotten a little mixed up and is overreacting to things that aren't actually threats.

When you start to feel like you're losing control, try to focus on the present moment. Take slow, deep breaths, and remind yourself that you've gotten through tough moments before.

Sometimes you just want to get in and out without having to make small talk or deal with long lines. Self-checkout lines are a lifesaver for introverts or those who just need some alone time. I've had nights where I just needed to restock my essentials without having to put on a social face, and self-checkout was a blessing.

One thing that might make your experience even better is using the store's app to find the quietest hours or locations. Some stores even offer curbside pickup or delivery, so you can skip the lines altogether. Just something to consider if you're looking to minimize human interaction even further.

Overall, I'm with you - self-checkout lines can be a game-changer for people who value their alone time. Keep on scanning those groceries in peace!","

I was so prepared to do something, and when I wanted to start, I literally just waited. Soon, I ended up getting anxious, lol. Like, I can't make an action for myself.

Edit: I'm so freakin glad to be able to relate to yall! I really thought it was only me.",996,62,1590406502,"I seem to get this before I even decide on what I'm doing. I spend too long agonising over what I'm going to do that by the time I decide, it's too late. :/",94,jaffa_kree_66,"I can absolutely relate to this. In my case, I often felt very overwhelmed because of the number of tasks in front of me, so every little bits of motivation ended up being suppressed by my anxiety.

I saw a therapist for a bit, and one thing she said really stuck with me: ""Actions precedes emotions."" Essentially, nobody has ever felt anything positive about tasks to come. You really need to give yourself a good kick in the butt to get started. Super hard at first, but after a while I find that you manage to do it more and more, and it can be really satisfying. 

So I guess you could try to ignore those feelings and get started, and see where it gets you. It's a journey, sometimes it feels being proactive, sometimes it feels like it's the last thing you want to do. One thing's for sure though, it's that it gets easier. 

Hope that helps a bit.",69,qwasvo,"I totally get what you're talking about. It's like there's this weird disconnect between your brain and your body, where you're all mentally prepared to take action, but somehow, you just can't seem to get started. I've been there too, and it's really frustrating.

I think what's happening is that your brain is getting caught up in overthinking and anxiety, which can actually paralyze you from taking action. It's like your brain is saying, ""Okay, let's do this!"" but then immediately starts worrying about all the things that could go wrong, and that's enough to keep you stuck.

One thing that might help is to try to break down the task into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of saying, ""Okay, let's start doing this huge thing,"" try saying, ""Okay, let's just take this tiny first step."" That can make it feel less overwhelming and make it easier to get started. Also, try to be kind to yourself and remember that it's okay to feel stuck sometimes. You're not alone in this, and it's definitely not just you.","

I've struggled with anxiety myself, and it's amazing how often our fears of what might happen can be more debilitating than the actual event.

o0ovub,Anxiety,I quit my six-figure job to recover,hnrei,"This was possibly the hardest decision I‚Äôve ever had to make. I‚Äôve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn‚Äôt stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn‚Äôt taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I‚Äôm a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don‚Äôt have a fully laid out plan of what I‚Äôm going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit.

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we need to push through and be strong, but the truth is, taking care of ourselves is the strongest thing we can do. I love that you're finding solace in running and taking small steps towards healing. Remember, recovery is a journey, and it's okay to not have it all figured out just yet.

As for what others think, try not to worry too much about it. You do you, and if that means taking a break from a high-stress job to focus on yourself, that's perfectly okay. You're not a quitter; you're a person who values their well-being. Keep taking care of yourself and know that you're not alone in this journey.

No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

As someone who's also struggled with anxiety and depression, I've often found solace in nature and the idea of escaping the chaos of everyday life. It sounds like you've already discovered what brings you peace and happiness, and that's a beautiful thing.

While building a cabin in the wilderness might not be a feasible solution for everyone, you might consider taking smaller steps towards creating that sense of seclusion and self-sufficiency. Look into local camping spots, national parks, or even just taking a weekend trip to a secluded area. Even just a few days of disconnecting from the world can be incredibly rejuvenating.

It's also worth exploring ways to incorporate elements of that wilderness lifestyle into your daily life. Maybe try gardening, foraging, or even just taking a walk in a nearby park each day. These small acts can help you feel more connected to nature and give you a sense of control over your environment.

Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging your needs and desires. Keep exploring and finding ways to prioritize your mental health ‚Äì you got this.","

POST BODY: Not just in the sense of stay at home in bed but to actually get out and find an ideal looking wilderness to just stay in. No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

I've suffered with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety and Depression for most of my life and have always felt more at peace and happier when out in the wilderness and cut off from everybody else.

Dead serious, I have no issue ordering subway but the thought of having to get two at the same time seems impossible. Huge congrats either way, people think it‚Äôs the big dramatic anxieties that are the toughest but I‚Äôve always found the day to day victories make me feel much more awesome :)",15,dinaduru,"""Hey OP, I just wanted to say congratulations on ordering those Subway sandwiches - that's a huge accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself. It's amazing how often we downplay our own victories, but the truth is, facing and overcoming anxiety in everyday situations like this takes a lot of courage.

I can imagine how scary it must be to feel like you're 'on the spot' and worried about how others might perceive you. But here's the thing: most people are too caught up in their own stuff to even notice. And the ones who do notice are likely to be understanding and supportive (just like this community!).

Keep pushing yourself to tackle these small challenges - they might seem insignificant to others, but they're a big deal for you, and that's what matters. You're building confidence and momentum, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, you're doing great!""","

mmmr2i,Anxiety,I ate after 5 days.,mxlapxta,"I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) &amp; it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget &amp; 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something &amp; I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow &amp; chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies &amp; crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC &amp; I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal &amp; feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again. I started singing again, listening to music, writing &amp; socialising with my friends.",981,71,1617868122,"a win for today!

I don't have quite the same issue but after losing my beloved pet a few weeks ago super suddenly (she was like a child to me, and so important) I have become completely disinterested in most foods, and it's a chore to eat. So I can imagine how difficult an obstacle this must be!! 

Congratulations!! 

Good luck at the doctor tomorrow! Also idk if you would be interested/have these in your area but I recommend dino nuggets. Idk why but I am so much more likely to eat them than regular nuggets üòÇ",2,littlemissparadox,"I just wanted to say huge congratulations to you for taking that massive step and eating after 5 days. It's completely understandable that your emetophobia held you back, but it's amazing that you found the strength to push through and take care of yourself.

I'm also thrilled to hear that the medication has been helping you so much already. It's incredible that you've been able to enjoy big meals and engage in activities you love without feeling overwhelmed by anxiety.

One thing that might be helpful to remember is that it's okay to have ups and downs, even with medication. It's not a magic fix, but it can definitely be a game-changer. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if you have tough days. You've come so far, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself.

Keep taking care of yourself and celebrating those small (and big) wins. You got this!","

Sometimes I hear another persons voice if it was some kind critique, like a former boss or something.",2,iFFyCaRRoT,"I completely understand what you're talking about, and it's actually a pretty common phenomenon. Research suggests that people with anxiety and other mental health conditions are more likely to experience internal monologues or 'self-talk'. It's as if our brains are constantly narrating our thoughts and emotions, and for some of us, that can manifest as distinct 'voices' in our heads.

I think it's awesome that you've developed a positive relationship with your inner voice, and that it helps you cope with anxiety. That's a great tool to have in your toolkit. As for the negative intrusive thoughts, it might be helpful to remind yourself that they're not necessarily a reflection of your true self, but rather a product of your anxious brain. Try to practice self-compassion and acknowledge those thoughts without judgment. Remember, you're not alone in this ‚Äì many people experience similar internal struggles, and it's okay to have multiple 'voices' in your head. Keep talking to yourself and finding ways to manage those negative thoughts. You're doing great.","

emm7fd,Anxiety,Have you ever postponed crying and then couldn't cry later?,meowmeansgetout,"So I had a crappy day, was condemned in public and I controlled myself from crying. It was a success! But I still felt like crying and the feeling of sadness/anger/misunderstood was(and still) stuck inside me. I waited until I could get back home to cry. However, when I get back I'm too tired to cry? Does that make sense üòÇ",955,96,1578632516,"Yep, it sure does. I have been sad at times and just can't cry and it makes me feel sick tbh",158,saffire_playz,"Yep, it sure does. I have been sad at times and just can't cry and it makes me feel sick tbh",158,saffire_playz,"I totally get it, OP. It's like your emotions got stuck in limbo, and you're left feeling drained but not able to release that pent-up energy. I've been there too, where I've held it together in public, only to come home and feel too exhausted to even process my emotions.

Here's the thing: it's okay if you don't cry right away. Sometimes, our brains just need a little time to catch up with our emotions. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to have a good cry, and instead, focus on taking care of yourself. Get a good night's sleep, engage in some self-care activities that bring you comfort, and see if you can't shake off some of that emotional weight.

It might also be helpful to try journaling or talking to someone about what happened. Sometimes, putting your feelings into words can help you release that emotional tension, even if you're not crying. Remember, you don't have to do this alone, and it's okay to reach out for support when you need it.","

k5xlxc,Anxiety,Does anyone else preemptively 'mourn' the loss of your family?,rougethebatt,"My obsession with death is always just me trying to cope with the idea of losing any member of my family.

Late at night, I find myself thinking of losing my husband or son and I 'grieve' for hours. Sometimes I think of my own death and cry too-- not because of being afraid of death but because I don't want to leave my family behind. The idea that life is so fragile and one day things can drastically change scares me so much. I saw this happen to my brother in law who died from colon cancer. I'm so scared of our lives turning on a dime like that.

I used to be like this as a kid too-- but with my parents. Somehow this obsession is much worse now with my own tiny family.",935,116,1607003702,"I do it a lot. Unfortunately I lost my mom, I was grieving her before she past away (but when I already knew she was sick). And after it happened, I realized I regret doing it so much. Grieve is the hardest thing I've ever did and I wish I didn't do it before, I should have enjoyed the thought of having her instead",136,karo_96,This sounds almost like a specific kind of OCD. Have you been to a psychologist/psychiatrist?,2,SheruBeeLee,"I can totally relate to what you're going through. It's like our minds are trying to prepare us for the worst, even if it's not conscious. I've found myself in similar situations, especially after experiencing a loss in my own family. It's like our brains are trying to process the 'what ifs' and the fragility of life.

One thing that's helped me is to acknowledge and accept these feelings, rather than trying to suppress them. It's okay to feel scared and to grieve for the potential losses in our lives. But it's also important to remember that these thoughts are just that - thoughts. They don't define our reality.

When I catch myself in these 'mourning' spirals, I try to refocus on the present moment and the things I can control. I remind myself of all the good times I've had with my loved ones and the memories we're still creating. It's not about avoiding the fear, but about not letting it consume me. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Sending you a big virtual hug.","

I can only imagine how tough it must've been to deal with 3 months of disrupted sleep, and the anxiety of finally addressing the issue.

It's totally normal to ruminate on the situation now, but try to focus on the fact that you took control and asserted yourself. That takes a ton of courage, and you should be proud of yourself. As for tonight's sleep, maybe try some calming techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation to help calm your mind.

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. You deserve a good night's sleep, and it's not unreasonable to expect that from your living situation. Hopefully, tomorrow night will indeed be better, and you can start getting the rest you need. Keep taking care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further support.""","

First of all, acknowledge that your emotions are valid. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're not doing well, so kudos to you for sharing this.

As for bouncing back, it might help to reframe your thinking. Instead of beating yourself up over the mistake, try to focus on what you can learn from it. Your boss likely wasn't trying to attack you personally, but rather to help you grow.

Take some time to collect yourself, but don't feel like you need to rush back to work right away. When you're ready, try to identify some things you can do to move forward and prevent similar mistakes in the future. And hey, if you need a good cry, that's okay too.

I can relate to feeling a bit anxious when waking up to unread messages, especially if you're not a morning person. The anticipation of having to respond and the uncertainty of what the message might be about can be overwhelming.

One thing that might help is setting boundaries for yourself. Allow yourself a few minutes in the morning to slowly wake up and get ready for the day before checking your phone. This can help you feel more grounded and prepared for whatever messages you might have.

As for multiple texters, I'm with you - it can be overwhelming! You might consider talking to the people who tend to send multiple messages at once and kindly ask them to consolidate their thoughts into one text. It's a reasonable request, and they might not even realize how it's affecting you.

Remember, it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own comfort level when it comes to communication. You're not alone in feeling anxious about texts, and taking care of yourself is the most important thing.","

bjjn70,Anxiety,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...,piercingjoy," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down.

People weren't weighing me down by just being there. Then one thing happened Sunday and now I'm worst than ever. This isn't helping. Maybe I was just used to being bad for so long that I didn't realize how bad it was until the shift in mood.,19,bowlingdoughnuts,"Wow, I just took a minute to go through your steps and I can already feel a difference. I've been there too, feeling overwhelmed and lost in the chaos of daily life. It's amazing how a simple reminder to breathe and relax can make such a huge impact.

I love the idea of carrying around a list of calming activities - I think I'll start doing that too. It's so easy to get caught up in anxiety and forget about the things that bring us peace. And I completely agree with you about not being alone in this - it's a comforting thought to know that thousands of people are going through the same emotions.

Thank you for sharing this and being so open about your struggles. It's beautiful to see how venting and sharing your experiences has helped not just you, but others as well. Keep taking care of yourself and remember, you're not alone. Sending you love and calm vibes","

POST TITLE: If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...

POST BODY:  A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone &lt;3

I've been there too, and it's like your mind is constantly racing and you just can't shut it off.

First of all, I want to acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the toll anxiety is taking on you. That's a huge step. Now, I'm not going to pretend that I'm one of those people who can just ""walk away clean"" after an interaction, but I do want to share something that's helped me.

For me, it's about reframing my thinking. Instead of worrying about every little thing, I try to focus on what I can control in the moment. It's not always easy, but it's helped me to calm down and not get caught up in worst-case scenarios.

It might be helpful to start small ‚Äì try to catch yourself when you're spiraling into worry mode and gently bring yourself back to the present. Also, have you considered journaling or talking to a therapist? Sometimes just sharing your feelings with someone who gets it can be a huge relief.

You're not alone in this, and there is hope for finding more peace.","

Good luck!",62,redcdr,[deleted],12,[deleted],"""Huge congratulations on finally taking the leap and starting therapy. I completely understand the anxiety that comes with sharing your progress, even in a supportive community like this. It's amazing that you've been working on your social anxiety over the past few months, and this is a huge step forward.

As for what to expect, therapy is a journey, not a destination. It's a process of self-discovery, growth, and learning to navigate your thoughts and emotions. Be patient with yourself, and don't put too much pressure on 'fixing' everything at once. Focus on small, incremental changes, and celebrate those tiny victories.

Remember that it's okay to still feel anxious or uncertain at times. That's all part of the process. Your therapist is there to support and guide you, not to 'fix' you. You're already taking a huge step by showing up and being willing to work on yourself. Be kind to yourself, and remember that you're not alone in this journey. Wishing you all the best on this new chapter!""","

Anxiety can be super overwhelming, and the physical symptoms like nausea can be especially tough to deal with. It's like your body is trying to tell you something, but you're not quite sure what.

First of all, just want to say that you're not alone in this. Lots of people experience anxiety without even realizing where it's coming from. It might be helpful to try to identify some patterns or triggers in your daily life - is it certain situations, people, or even just specific times of the day? Keeping a journal or talking to a trusted friend or therapist can be a great way to explore this.

In the meantime, there are some things that might help you cope with those anxious feelings. Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and physical activity can all be super helpful in calming your body and mind. And hey, just knowing that you're not alone in this can be a big comfort. Sending you lots of support and positive vibes.","

It's like you're stuck in this constant push-pull between craving connection and feeling overwhelmed by social interactions. First of all, know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with social anxiety, and it's amazing you're aware of your emotions and willing to work on them.

One thing that might help is finding a middle ground. Instead of always being in a crowded space or completely alone, try to find smaller, low-key groups or one-on-one connections. This could be as simple as meeting a friend for coffee or joining a small club/hobby group that aligns with your interests.

Also, try to focus on self-care and self-compassion when you are alone. Instead of beating yourself up over not enjoying solitude, try to find small joys in the quiet moments ‚Äì read a book, take a relaxing bath, or practice some gentle stretches. You don't have to love being alone, but learning to tolerate and even appreciate it can be a game-changer. Keep in mind, it's a process, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.","

I've been there too, constantly second-guessing myself and my relationships. It sounds like you're dealing with a mix of anxiety, self-doubt, and fear of rejection.

Firstly, it's essential to recognize that your feelings are valid, but they might not necessarily reflect reality. It's possible that your friends and family do care about you and value your relationships, even if you make mistakes or have disagreements.

One thing that might help is to have open and honest conversations with your loved ones. Instead of assuming they dislike you, try asking them how they feel about your relationships. This can help clear up any misconceptions and strengthen your bonds.

Also, remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and have imperfections. Nobody is perfect, and relationships involve growth, forgiveness, and understanding. Try to be kinder to yourself and focus on the positive aspects of your relationships. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you deeply.","

One thing that's helped me is recognizing that this feeling is often a physical manifestation of my anxiety. When I feel myself getting lightheaded or dizzy, I try to take a step back (literally, if possible) and focus on my breath. I remind myself that this feeling will pass, and that I'm safe.

It might sound simple, but it's helped me to reframe my anxiety as something that's not a threat, but rather a signal that I need to take care of myself. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take a moment to collect yourself. You're not alone in this, and there are people who understand what you're going through. Sending you calm vibes!","

But you're right - our thoughts and emotions don't have to control us. We are so much more than our anxiety.

I've found it helpful to take things one step at a time, and to focus on what I can control in the moment. When my mind starts racing, I try to bring my attention back to my breath, or to something I'm grateful for. It's not always easy, but it helps to calm me down and gain some perspective.

Thanks for the reminder, OP. Your kind words and good vibes are appreciated, and I'm sending some back your way. To anyone else who's struggling, just know that you're not alone, and that it's okay to not be okay. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time.","

",881,158,1548157297,"Absolutely. I spent 6 years getting my masters, and I officially hate the industry I chose. I worked for a company for 7 years in the industry, only to be fired without cause (in in an at will state), and then pretty much reminded that loyalty is expected from one side and not the other.  
  
I'm now unemployed, and genuinely trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life. It's Best to have this happen when you're still young, like late twenties, than fifties I suppose.  
  
My point is, you're going to have issues no matter what you do. It helps to remember that a job is just a job.",166,JustHereForPorn12345,I'm about to take a test that could make or break my job.

I've been there too, constantly second-guessing my decisions and worrying that I'm not on the ""right"" path.

Here's the thing: there's no one ""right"" career path. What's right for someone else might not be right for you. And the truth is, most people don't have it figured out (even if they seem like they do on social media).

Instead of focusing on finding the ""perfect"" job, try to think about what you value in a career. What kind of work environment do you thrive in? What kind of work makes you feel fulfilled? What are your non-negotiables?

It might also be helpful to reframe your thinking around ""mistakes."" Instead of seeing a job as a mistake if it's not a perfect fit, think of it as a stepping stone. You can always learn and grow from every experience, and it's okay to pivot if needed.

Remember, your career is a journey, not a destination. You got this, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out.","

rk0qca,Anxiety,Do you feel just super fatigue when your anxiety calms down??,Kyshawn_Lol,Like so tired and you just wanna stay in your bed.,944,95,1639933054,Yeah. Almost like a hangover.,209,Susccmmp,Yes!,16,Beanz378,"I totally get what you're saying. It's like your anxiety is this constant, draining hum in the background, and when it finally subsides, you're left feeling completely exhausted. It's not just the anxiety itself that's draining, but also the constant hypervigilance and tension that comes with it. When that finally lets up, it's like your body just collapses from the relief.

One thing that might help is to try and prioritize self-care when you're feeling anxious. Weirdly, sometimes doing small, gentle activities like taking a warm bath, going for a short walk, or practicing some light stretches can help you feel a bit more grounded and calm. And when you do finally crash, try not to be too hard on yourself. It's okay to take a day (or two, or three) to just rest and recharge.

Remember that it's not just physical exhaustion, but also emotional exhaustion. So be kind to yourself, and try to focus on the fact that you made it through the anxious part ‚Äì that's something to be proud of!","

I love your idea of creating a cozy atmosphere with blackout blinds, dim lights, and a haunted house fireplace video - it sounds like the perfect way to unwind after a long day. If you're open to trying new things, you might also want to explore ASMR videos on YouTube, which can be super helpful for anxiety and relaxation.

ibzmrv,Anxiety,So I hospitalised myself,HeatLightning,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. üòÄ

Just wanted to share because, well, I feel pretty alone in this.",884,153,1597751899,"I can empathize where you're coming from, I find life to be utterly inexplicable in an existential sense. For a while, I dealt with questioning gravity. On other days, I too have questioned the meaning of time. I think the best way to conquer existential anxiety (not that I have) is to practice acceptance therapy. The world is the way it is, we can continue to question, although our minds are not borne to be able to comprehend it's grandeur. Time is solely a concept created by humans, rather, we developed a sense of time to describe the act of change. In the interim, take a deep breath and address the concerns that you have. It is natural to worry, even more so to question the meaning of life. Existentialism is a very real anxiety-inducing concept, something that I've been dealing with since the age of five. Stay strong, you got this :)",118,littlebro41,"Since you have your phone can you order Uber eats?? Heck, pm me the address, I‚Äôll send you a pizza!!",2,aa_44,"I'm so glad you're reaching out and sharing your experience, and I'm even more glad you're taking steps to get help. Existential anxiety can be incredibly overwhelming, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging the need for support.

Firstly, please know you're not alone in this. There are many people who struggle with similar questions and fears. It's actually a sign of your intelligence and curiosity that you're grappling with these deep questions.

One thing that might help is to focus on the present moment and what you can control, rather than getting caught up in the unknowns of the universe. Mindfulness practices, meditation, or even just taking a few deep breaths can help calm your mind.

It's great that your doctor is empathetic and trying different approaches to help you manage your anxiety. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it might take some trial and error to find what works for you.

Keep sharing, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

I also clench my jaws, shoulders and neck muscles and get nauseous.",28,Its402am,"I totally get it, that rollercoaster feeling in the pit of your stomach is super unsettling. I've experienced something similar, but for me, it's more of a tightness in my chest and shoulders. It's like my body is constantly on high alert, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

First of all, just want to say that it's great you're acknowledging your symptoms and talking about them. That's a huge step in managing anxiety. One thing that's helped me is to focus on my breath when I feel that physical tension creeping in. Try taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. It can help calm your nervous system and reduce that rollercoaster feeling.

Also, don't worry too much about your appetite - it's common for anxiety to affect your eating habits. Just try to eat when you feel like it, and don't put too much pressure on yourself. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Keep talking about your feelings, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.","

jyl357,Anxiety,I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbor,ParticularAmphibian,"Like the title says, I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbors house instead of mine.

But today I just took a deep breath, went over to the neighbors house, and knocked on their door. He answered right away and was very nice and gave me my package!

I think what's really important here is that you acknowledged your anxiety, took a deep breath, and pushed through it. That takes a lot of courage, and it's something to be proud of. Remember that it's okay to feel anxious in situations like this, but it's how you respond to those feelings that matters.

Keep celebrating these small wins - they can add up and make a big difference in your life. And don't underestimate the power of a simple 'hello' and a friendly interaction with your neighbors. It can make a big difference in how connected you feel to your community. Keep pushing forward and being kind to yourself - you're doing great!""","

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her ""what's the point?"". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. There are many people who do care and are willing to listen and understand. It's essential to surround yourself with those who uplift and support you, even if it's just online communities or support groups.

One thing that might help is to educate others about anxiety and its effects. Sometimes, people don't realize the harm they're causing, and a gentle explanation can go a long way. However, don't feel obligated to do this if it's not safe or comfortable for you.

Remember that your anxiety doesn't define you, and you're so much more than your struggles. You deserve kindness, compassion, and understanding, just like anyone else. Keep pushing forward, and know that there are people who care about you and want to help.","

csy70b,Anxiety,I'm anxious about being able to get a job so I avoid applying to jobs so I don't feel anxious about it so I feel more anxious about not having a job!,comeonmaggie,I just need to get over it!! I can get a job! I can apply! I can interview and do the job!! Why is it so hard to make myself do the applications holy shit!!!,932,100,1566305161,"I was just in this slump. Try going to the library or a cafe with your laptop and applying outside. It helped me a lot to have a fresh ""space"" and made me feel forced",146,bleepblorp9878,"Speaking from experience... apply for a bunch of jobs you don't want. You'll be more confident without the pressure of desperately wanting to get the job, and you'll get practice applying and hopefully interviewing. 

Then you can apply and interview for the jobs you want to do with a bit less fear :)

Edit: I'm a professional writer so if you would like to have your resume or cover letter double-checked, PM me and I'm happy to help out for free!",7,pm_me_your_cobloaf,"I totally get it - it's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety. It's like, you want a job, but the thought of applying and potentially facing rejection is just too overwhelming. And then, to make matters worse, you feel anxious about not having a job, which only adds to the stress.

First of all, just know that you're not alone in this. So many people struggle with this exact same thing. It's not that you're not capable of getting a job - it's just that your brain is playing tricks on you.

One thing that might help is to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Instead of thinking ""I need to get a job,"" try thinking ""I need to apply to one job today."" Or, ""I need to update my resume."" Focus on the small steps, rather than the big picture. And remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. You don't have to tackle everything at once.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel anxious, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Just take a deep breath, and remember that you got this.","

After being out and about, I often feel drained, both physically and mentally. It's like my social battery needs to be replenished before I can face the world again.

I think it's really healthy that you're acknowledging your need for downtime and taking care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we need to be constantly 'on' and productive, but that's just not sustainable.

My advice would be to make the most of those recharge days - do whatever makes you feel relaxed and rejuvenated, whether that's reading a book, taking a nap, or just enjoying some quiet time. Don't feel guilty about it either - remember that rest is an important part of being productive and happy in the long run.

You're definitely not alone in this feeling, and I'm glad you shared it with us. Hope you're having a great recharge day!","

What was the joke?,16,Jambohar01,"I totally get it. It's amazing how something as simple as making others laugh can bring up such strong emotions. It's like your brain is caught off guard - 'wait, I'm actually making a difference and people are enjoying my company.' It can be overwhelming, especially if you're not used to being the center of attention.

First of all, kudos to you for being able to make your coworkers laugh - that's no easy feat. As for the emotions that came flooding in, just remember that it's okay to feel vulnerable. It doesn't mean you're weak; it means you're human. 

If you ever feel like you're on the verge of tears in a similar situation, just take a deep breath and acknowledge the feeling. You can even use the 'I need some fresh air' excuse again - it's a great way to step away and collect yourself without drawing attention to your emotions. Keep being your awesome self and spreading laughter - the world needs more of that.","

I've experienced this too, and it can be pretty unsettling. From what I've learned, it's actually a common physical symptom of anxiety. When we're feeling anxious, our body's 'fight or flight' response kicks in, which can cause blood vessels to dilate and lead to increased blood flow to the skin. This can result in that warm, flushed feeling you're describing.

One thing that's helped me is taking a few deep breaths and trying to focus on the sensation in my body. It sounds weird, but acknowledging and accepting it can actually help calm me down. I've also found that practicing relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation or visualization can be really helpful in managing anxiety.

You're not alone in this, and it's not anything to be ashamed of. Anxiety can be really tough to deal with, but there are lots of resources and strategies that can help. If you're interested, I can recommend some online resources or threads that might be helpful.""","

I'm so sorry that happened to you. As others have said, this was not your fault whatsoever. Do not blame yourself one iota. You did nothing wrong. 

That's the main thing I wanted to say. You did nothing wrong.

If you continue to feel shaken up, I hear you. You deserve to be safe and feel safe. After being robbed at knifepoint, I started training jiu-jitsu because I wish I would've fought back. But the most important thing in self-defense is protecting yourself. If you can get away, get away. Get out of danger the best you can. Fight back if you can't. Pepper spray is effective and may help give you the peace of mind you deserve. Many jiu-jitsu schools also offer free seminars for women, where other trained women will support you.

You are great.",2,RainAcademic,"I'm so sorry you had to go through that. No one deserves to be harassed or made to feel uncomfortable and humiliated like that. It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and want to just hide away right now.

First of all, let me say that what you're wearing has absolutely nothing to do with what happened. You're not 'dressed too provocatively' - you're just dressing for the weather. And even if you were wearing something more revealing, that still wouldn't give anyone the right to touch or harass you.

It's great that you're feeling more encouraged to report the incident after reading the supportive comments here. When you're ready, please do report it - not just for yourself, but for others who might be at risk of going through the same thing.

Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Take your time to process your emotions, and don't feel pressured to 'toughen up' or 'get over it' too quickly. You're allowed to feel whatever you're feeling right now.","

It sounds like you're experiencing a form of social anxiety, and it's not uncommon. Sometimes our brains can overthink and catastrophize interactions, even with people we know and like.

For what it's worth, it's not about being embarrassed about your job or car, it's about the perceived vulnerability of being 'seen' and potentially judged or expected to interact in a certain way. It's like your brain is saying, 'What if they want to talk? What if they think I'm doing something wrong?'

One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around these interactions. Instead of 'Oh no, they're going to see me,' try thinking 'Hey, I'm just living my life, and that's okay.' Remind yourself that you're not obligated to engage with them if you don't feel like it, and that it's okay to just smile and wave.

It might also be helpful to practice some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or positive self-talk, when you start to feel anxious. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.","

POST TITLE: I GOT A JOB!

POST BODY: The past 6 months my agoraphobia had gotten so bad that I avoided leaving my house completely. A few days ago I decided to start applying for jobs. I had an interview today and after having 2 panic attacks about it and fighting my fears for hours, I went. 

The interview went so well that they wanted me to fill a different position that would be way more interesting, pay more, and I‚Äôd have my own office. I was hired on the spot. 

Needed to share this with somewhere. Don‚Äôt have a lot of friends lol:)

Update: 
Thank you for the silver‚ù§Ô∏è I had my first day today and it was awesome. My manager is great.

fe0262,Anxiety,Anyone else get irrationally anxious to the point where they just clear notifications instead of reading them?,macaroniemaniac,"Lately I've noticed I've been putting more off than usual, including even looking at my phone. I can't explain it. I know for a fact that when I open noticifications I receive, I'm the only one I can tell that they were seen. That still doesn't stop the feeling I get when I think about looking them. Panic, i feel like I'm gonna disappoint whoever the sender is with whatever I come up with as a response. It's ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. Anyone have any solutions to anything like this? Not currently on medication, working on getting on it (I'm canadian and need to apply for a physician because my childhood one is no longer my family's provider), I'm 23 year old male if that matters.",958,69,1583434656,"I have that all the time. I find that if I just pick it up and respond right away it's not as stressful/difficult/scary as I thought to reply or take care of whatever it is. I leave my phone alone for hours at a time because it stresses me out to figure out what to say or do, especially when I know the notification is about something I already stress about, but it's worse the longer I leave an unread text or email on my phone so I've learned to just take care of it instantly. It takes a minute then it's over! I hope this makes sense and is helpful.

I agree with the previous poster that you should turn off your phone an hour or two before bed and not look at it again. I sleep so much better this way!",59,MamaMae1012,"Could you try limiting your exposure to your phone? For me personally, I notice my heart rate tends to increase whenever I'm on my phone, so at night I try to put it away by 9pm or so, and not look at it until the next morning. Having it in a completely separate room helps tremendously.",6,mzakflip40,"Hey OP, I totally feel you. I've been there too, where the anxiety of responding to notifications just feels overwhelming. It's like, you know the rational part of your brain is saying ""just check them, it's not a big deal,"" but the anxious part is just screaming ""NO, DON'T DO IT, YOU'LL MAKE A MISTAKE.""

One thing that's helped me is just taking a deep breath and telling myself that it's okay to respond at my own pace. I don't have to have an immediate reply ready. I can take a minute (or an hour, or a day) to gather my thoughts and respond when I'm feeling calmer.

Also, reminding myself that the sender is likely not expecting an instant response (and probably isn't even thinking about it that much) helps ease the pressure. It's not about disappointing them, it's about responding when I'm ready.

Hang in there, and good luck with getting set up with a new physician. Medication can be a game-changer for anxiety, and it's awesome that you're taking steps to prioritize your mental health.","

It's like your brain is constantly playing the ""what if"" game, replaying conversations and imagining all the ways you could've done things differently. I'm right there with you - I've spent hours (even days) reliving conversations and cringing at my own responses.

First of all, know that you're not alone in this. It's actually a pretty common thing, especially for people who are more introverted or self-conscious. And honestly, it's a sign that you care about what others think and want to make a good impression.

Here's a tip that might help: try to catch yourself when you start replaying conversations in your head. Acknowledge the thought, but then gently tell yourself to let it go. Remind yourself that you can't change the past, and that the other person has probably already forgotten the conversation (or at least isn't dwelling on it as much as you are).

Lastly, try to focus on the present moment and the conversations you're having right now. Practice being kind to yourself and try not to worry too much about what others think. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

I did this about 3 years ago and now I choose to go to the cinema alone as a form of self-medication.

You've shown yourself that you're capable of pushing past your anxiety and doing something you enjoy, and that's a great feeling to hold onto.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do it again right away, but know that you can build on this momentum whenever you're ready. Celebrate this win and take care of yourself - you got this. What did you think of the film, by the way? Was it your first time seeing it?""","

It's incredible how a simple act of understanding and empathy can turn someone's day around.

It's clear that her willingness to listen and share her own struggles helped you feel seen and heard. And I think that's something we can all learn from - the power of human connection and vulnerability.

Your experience is a great reminder that we're never truly alone in our struggles. There are people out there who get it, who understand what we're going through. So, thank you for sharing this beautiful story, and I'm sending you all the positive vibes as you navigate this challenging time. Keep pushing forward, and remember that you're strong!","

I‚Äôll snap at the people around me, I get disoriented and withdraw. 

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn‚Äôt so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn‚Äôt just accept that I had done well.

I've experienced similar anxiety manifestations, and it's amazing how often we can be our own worst critics. The self-doubt and negative self-talk can be just as exhausting as the physical symptoms.

One thing that's helped me is to reframe those thoughts by practicing self-compassion. When I catch myself saying things like ""why can't you just calm down?"", I try to respond with a kinder, more realistic inner voice. I remind myself that it's okay to feel anxious, and that my heart is just trying to protect me (even if it's being a bit overzealous).

It might also be helpful to recognize that your brain is wired to focus on potential threats, which can lead to those negative thoughts. But that doesn't mean they're true! When you start to spiral into self-doubt, try to challenge those thoughts by asking yourself if there's any evidence to support them.

Firstly, just know that you're not alone in feeling this way. There are many people who are still taking precautions and are concerned about the rising numbers.

One thing that might help you cope with your anxiety is to focus on what you can control. You're already taking steps to protect yourself and your partner, which is great. Try not to worry too much about what others are doing, as that can be overwhelming. Instead, encourage your partner to prioritize their safety at work and support them in any way you can.

Lastly, remember that you can't change how others behave, but you can control how you react to them. Take care of yourself and try to find ways to manage your stress.","

I've been there too - my mask became this weird security blanket during the pandemic. It's not just about hiding acne or feeling naked without it, but also the sense of comfort and familiarity it provides. It's like our brains have wired it as a coping mechanism, and now we feel uneasy without it.

I think the first step is acknowledging that it's okay to feel this way. It's a normal response to the crazy times we've been living in. What helped me was gradually introducing 'mask-free' time into my daily routine. Start small - take a short walk without your mask, or meet a friend in a low-key setting. It might feel weird at first, but slowly, you'll get used to it.

Remember, it's not about getting rid of the mask entirely, but about finding a healthy balance. You can still wear it when you need to, but also work on becoming comfortable without it. You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're recognizing your dependence on it. That's the first step to breaking free from it.","

I love the points you mentioned, especially the resilience one - it's so true. 

For me, having anxiety has actually helped me develop better problem-solving skills. When I'm anxious, my brain goes into overdrive trying to anticipate and prepare for every possible outcome. While it can be overwhelming, it's also helped me think on my feet and come up with creative solutions to problems. 

I also appreciate how anxiety has made me more empathetic. When you're constantly trying to manage your own emotions, you develop a deeper understanding of what others might be going through. It's helped me become a better friend and listener.

Thanks for sharing your perspective and creating a space for us to focus on the positives. You're right, it does take a special kind of person to face their anxiety head-on every day, and I'm grateful to be part of this community. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

POST TITLE: Tell me why you‚Äôre thankful for anxiety

POST BODY: I know this sounds strange because anxiety SUCKS, but in an attempt to bring some positivity, I‚Äôd like to hear some benefits to your anxiety! 

Here are mine:
I‚Äôm super careful with money and I take extra care with my finances

I appreciate the little things more than most people do

I think those of us with anxiety are more resilient

Edit: It takes a special kind of person to walk through hell and back every single day and still wake up in the morning ready to try again. I‚Äôm so proud of every single person here ‚ù§Ô∏è

vtzolh,Anxiety,Anyone miss the person they used to be?,Over_Landscape5484,"I was a genuine extrovert who loved going out with friends and would do it as many times as I could.

Now here I am on the couch feeling like I‚Äôm dying just from a night out at the movies with my gf. I also had a big weekend with some of my buddies and did a lot of drinking. Of course the drinks actually calm me down and allow me to have fun but I‚Äôm still riding the consequences of that out.

Anyone else?",784,237,1657246904,Yes! I used to be so easy going and sociable. Now whenever I‚Äôm talking to someone my brain is concurrently thinking about everything that‚Äôs ever gone wrong in the past + everything that could go wrong in the future.,143,lilax1999,I can‚Äôt even put into words how accurate this is,93,Noahsmith132,"I totally get it, and I'm glad you're acknowledging these changes. It's normal for people to evolve, and sometimes that means our energy levels and preferences shift. I used to be a party animal too, but over time, I've become more of a homebody. It's not that I don't enjoy socializing, but I just don't have the same endurance I used to.

One thing that helped me was learning to prioritize self-care and set boundaries. Instead of trying to keep up with my old lifestyle, I focus on activities that nourish my mind and body. Maybe try saying no to events that drain you, and yes to ones that genuinely excite you. It's okay to take time for yourself and recharge.

Remember, it's not about missing the person you used to be, but about embracing who you are now. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's great that you have a supportive partner who can help you navigate these changes. Be kind to yourself, and don't be too hard on your new normal.","

I can totally relate to feeling like it's never going to happen, and the anxiety of dealing with driving instructors can be overwhelming. It's amazing that you were able to push through and overcome that. 

I think it's really interesting that you mention being more worried about what the instructors thought of you than the actual driving. It just goes to show how much of a mental game driving tests can be. It's awesome that you were able to work through that and come out on top.

Also, shoutout to zoloft for helping you manage your anxiety - it's not always easy to talk about, but it's so important to prioritize our mental health. You should be incredibly proud of yourself for facing your fears and coming out on top. Enjoy the freedom of driving without the stress of tests, and don't forget to celebrate your win!""","

l3x18k,Anxiety,I (f22) negotiated with a car salesman by myself,phyllisdankworth,"2 years ago I couldn't go anywhere alone. I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do.",982,37,1611484033,"If you called your dad for advice mid-negotiation I think you deserve an extra bit of praise - 'cause that's hard to do. A negotiator is going to want you isolated and get you to agree to their terms before you have a chance to really think about it. Being able to put a stop to it, get your phone out and give your dad a call -twice- is impressive.",195,ThyRosen,,0,,"""Huge congratulations to you, OP. I can only imagine how daunting that must've been, especially given your past experiences with anxiety. It's amazing that you pushed through and came out on top. Not only did you negotiate a great deal, but you also gained a ton of confidence in the process.

I love that you called your dad for advice, but still chose to take the reins and do it yourself. It just goes to show that having support doesn't mean you can't be independent and capable. Your growth and self-awareness are truly inspiring.

Remember that this is just the beginning - you've proven to yourself that you can handle challenging situations, and that's a powerful feeling. Don't be afraid to keep pushing your boundaries and trying new things. You got this. Keep celebrating your wins, no matter how small they may seem, and know that you have a community cheering you on.""","

I really needed to hear it today. It's so easy to get caught up in the vicious cycle of negative thoughts, but you're right - our anxiety can be a master manipulator. It's like having a constant, critical inner voice that we have to learn to tune out.

One thing that's helped me recently is to try and reframe my thoughts in a more realistic, compassionate light. Instead of beating myself up over perceived failures, I try to acknowledge the thoughts and remind myself that they're not necessarily based in reality. It's not always easy, but it's a helpful way to create some distance between my thoughts and my self-worth.

Thanks again for the reminder - it's so important to be kind to ourselves, especially when we're struggling. Sending you lots of love and solidarity""","

I‚Äôm 23, and working as an engineer. My company is part of a critical industry, so we‚Äôve been open, and I‚Äôve worked on site everyday since the pandemic began. At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn‚Äôt at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I‚Äôm constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I‚Äôm terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It‚Äôs affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù with when this all began.

He was already sick with terminal cancer, so when he got it, he was gone within 3 days. I went into shock. When I could sleep, I slept on my couch with all the lights on because I was having massive nocturnal panic attacks. Bad enough tho the point I went to the ER. I‚Äôm a full blown germaphobe now. Washing my hands until they crack, will only wear a mask once and change it, won‚Äôt touch anything in public. It‚Äôs pretty bad. The panic attacks are subsiding thankfully.",146,[deleted],"Absolutely! It's always bad but this is much worse. My therapist said something that I hang onto everyday, which was ""you can only control what you can control"". I unfollowed all news outlets or people that were constantly posting covid numbers and I realize I was creating my own narrative,but it helps me. I know that I'm going to wear my mask, keep my distance, wash my hands (prob too much) and that's all I can control. It's not a perfect system but it works for me. 

Hang in there. One day at a time.",50,MamaLlama2u,"I totally feel you. I've been dealing with anxiety since the pandemic started too, and it's been a wild ride. As someone who's also in a high-risk industry, I can understand the constant fear of getting sick and passing it on to loved ones. One thing that's helped me is to focus on what I can control - like following safety protocols at work, taking care of my physical health, and setting boundaries for my personal time.

It might sound silly, but I've also started keeping a ""symptom journal"" to track how I'm feeling. It's helped me to see that most of the time, my symptoms are just anxiety-related and not actually COVID. It's also been helpful to remind myself that I'm not a ""vector of doom"" - I'm taking care of myself and doing everything I can to stay safe.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about avoiding social interactions. It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your mental health right now. Maybe try reaching out to your friends and letting them know how you're feeling - they might be more understanding than you think. Hang in there, you're not alone.","

I used to experience that 'cloudy-minded' feeling all the time when I was dealing with anxiety. It's like your brain is foggy, but somehow you're still managing to go through the motions. It's a really frustrating and disorienting experience.

One thing that helped me was to acknowledge that my brain was just trying to protect itself from feeling overwhelmed. When we're anxious, our brains can go into 'survival mode,' making it harder to focus and think clearly. It's not a personal failing or a sign of weakness ‚Äì it's just your brain's way of coping.

If you feel like you're in that cloudy-minded state, try taking a few deep breaths and giving yourself permission to take a break. Sometimes, stepping away from a situation and doing something that calms you down (like going for a walk or practicing some gentle stretches) can help clear the fog. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to take care of yourself when you need it.""","

js3qdw,Anxiety,"You turned me into this, FUCK school. FUCK school, FUCK school. FUCK school",CookieSlammer9,"The amounts of hatred I have towards school is immesurable. IT made me into what I am. IT gave me HUGE amounts of COMPLETELY UNECESSARY anxiety and depression. IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

PS: School and the education system can go burn in hell. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT OF THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO????? WE AREN'T SOME FUCKING RATS IN A LAB THAT YOU POKE AT. Im so frustrated....

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**
2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**
3. **Despite  a minority of people disagreeing with me and calling me overdramatic, i  would just want to point out that i am venting and not stating  anything.**

SCHOOL.",9,matryoshka_03,"Hey OP, I can sense the raw emotion and pain in your post, and I want you to know that I'm here for you. It takes a lot of courage to share your struggles, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like mental health and addiction.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone. Your feelings are valid, and it's unacceptable that you weren't given the support you needed during your school years. Dysgraphia can be challenging, but it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's heartbreaking that you were blamed for your mistakes instead of being offered help.

Your story is a powerful reminder that the education system needs to change. It's not just about academics; it's about nurturing young minds and providing them with the tools they need to thrive.

If you're willing, consider reaching out to organizations that specialize in supporting people with learning disabilities and mental health issues. There are resources available, and it's never too late to seek help. You deserve to heal and find happiness. Keep talking, and know that you have a community that cares about you.","

POST TITLE: You turned me into this, FUCK school. FUCK school, FUCK school. FUCK school

POST BODY: The amounts of hatred I have towards school is immesurable. IT made me into what I am. IT gave me HUGE amounts of COMPLETELY UNECESSARY anxiety and depression. IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

PS: School and the education system can go burn in hell. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT OF THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO????? WE AREN'T SOME FUCKING RATS IN A LAB THAT YOU POKE AT. Im so frustrated....

Reposting this here because my comment probably wasn't seen:

EDIT: 

**OH  MY GOD! Thank you so much for the support, people. I just wanted to  vent out my feelings because they have been bottled up for years. I am  aware that a lot of you are asking me a lot of questions but i can't  asnwer everything. So here are some stuff i can say:**

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**
2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**
3. **Despite  a minority of people disagreeing with me and calling me overdramatic, i  would just want to point out that i am venting and not stating  anything.**

**THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT MEANS A LOT FOR ME! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3**

ebvl46,Anxiety,DAE's anxienty always make you assume that poeople are mad at you?,lonelyboi19,"I came to my dorm today to find my roommate studying for his finals so we only greeted each other, I sat down and let him study. He didn't talk to me much either cus obviously, he was studying.

Anything less than overt kindness (or in the case of texting, smile emojis and exclamation marks) makes me assume I've done something to make a person mad and that they now hate me.

I've been there too, where my brain decides to overanalyze every single interaction, convinced that someone's mad at me when in reality, they're just busy or preoccupied. It's like our brains have a default setting to assume the worst, right?

One thing that's helped me is to remind myself that people's behavior is often a reflection of their own stuff, not mine. So, in your case, your roommate was probably just focused on his finals and not thinking about you at all. It's also helpful to try to separate your thoughts from reality - just because you think something doesn't mean it's true.

Don't be too hard on yourself about being socially incompetent, either. We all misread social cues sometimes, and it's not uncommon for people with anxiety to struggle with this. You're not alone, and it's okay to make mistakes. Just take a deep breath, try to be kind to yourself, and remember that most people are too busy with their own lives to be mad at you.","

It sounds like you're feeling really self-conscious about conversations and worried that you're not meeting some kind of unspoken standard. First off, let me just say that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you're already dealing with anxiety and depression.

It's possible that your feelings of being ""stupid and spacey"" are more related to your mental health and less about your actual abilities. It's also possible that you've developed some coping mechanisms that might be holding you back in conversations. But here's the thing: you're not alone in this. So many people feel like they're just pretending to be a functioning adult, even if they're not.

My advice would be to try to be kinder to yourself in these conversations. Instead of focusing on the ""rules"" of conversation, try to focus on actually connecting with the other person. Ask them questions, listen actively, and see where the conversation goes. And hey, if you do happen to say something ""awkward,"" just laugh it off and keep moving. You're not defined by one conversation, and you're definitely not stupid.","

It's frustrating to see people conflate anxiety with narcissism, especially when it can be so damaging to those who are already struggling. As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I can attest to the fact that it's often the opposite of self-admiration - it's a crippling fear of being judged or rejected by others.

One thing that's helped me is to try to reframe my anxious thoughts in a more compassionate light. Instead of beating myself up over irrational worries, I remind myself that it's okay to have those thoughts, and that they don't define my worth as a person. It's also important to remember that anxiety is a common experience that many people face, and that we're not alone in our struggles.

One bad interaction can really throw off your whole day, and it sounds like you and your brother have a particularly tough time with anxiety in social situations. First of all, I want to say that it's not uncommon for people with anxiety to be more prone to rumination - that's just your brain's way of trying to process and make sense of what happened.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe those interactions in a more neutral or even positive light. For example, instead of dwelling on the employee following you around, you could remind yourself that they're just doing their job, and that it's not a personal attack on you or your brother. It might also help to have a plan in place for how to deal with those kinds of situations in the future - like taking a few deep breaths, or excusing yourself to step outside for a minute.

It's also really great that you're acknowledging how these interactions affect you, and that you're reaching out for support. That takes a lot of courage, and I'm sending you both lots of positive vibes.","

Not having to make small talk or deal with potentially awkward interactions can be a huge relief. Plus, being able to put on your noise-cancelling headphones and just focus on checking out can be really liberating.

That being said, I do want to mention that some stores are starting to phase out self-checkout lanes or limit their use due to concerns about job loss and the impact on local communities. Not saying that's necessarily relevant to your personal preference, but it's something to be aware of.

If you're someone who values your alone time and prefers to avoid interactions, there are other strategies you can use to minimize stress in social situations. For example, you could try shopping during off-peak hours or using online shopping with curbside pickup. Just some thoughts to consider. Either way, I'm right there with you in appreciating the convenience of self-checkout!","

The loneliness of anxiety can be suffocating, and it's like no matter how hard you try to explain it, others just can't quite grasp the intensity of what you're feeling.

First of all, just want to acknowledge that what you're going through is valid and real. It takes a lot of courage to admit how you're feeling, and I'm proud of you for being honest.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking around anxiety. Instead of seeing it as something that's uniquely yours to deal with, try to remind yourself that millions of people are going through the same thing. You're not alone in this, even if it feels that way.

Also, consider reaching out to a therapist or support group. Talking to people who get it can be a game-changer. You don't have to do this alone. Hang in there, and remember that you're stronger than you think.","

I have a group chat on Facebook of Xbox friends I've become really close to over the last 2 years, to the point where we're like family in always having each others backs and being there for each other. Things have felt distant lately and whenever I say something that just gets read and no replies, I feel like I'm just bothering them all and being annoying. Doesn't help that my depression wants me to know that I'm worthless and everyone would be better off without me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sigh. 

Anyway: you're not cringey to me, I get it. Have some internet love. ",85,SatansAssociate,"I totally get it, OP. It's like you're constantly wondering if you're coming across as the class clown or just a clown. I've been there too, and it's really tough to shake off that feeling of being cringey.

Firstly, acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect, and everyone does something cringey at some point. Even the people who seem super confident online have their own insecurities.

One thing that might help is to focus on your intentions rather than how others perceive you. Are you trying to make people laugh or connect with them? If so, that's what matters, not whether someone thinks you're cringey.

Also, try to reframe your self-talk. Instead of ""You'll never be good enough,"" tell yourself ""I'm doing my best, and that's enough."" And hey, it's okay to not be funny all the time ‚Äì it's actually really refreshing to see people being genuine and authentic online.

Lastly, take a break from social media if you need to, and focus on the people who appreciate you for who you are. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you beyond your online persona.","

I can only imagine how tough it must be to go back to work after 7 years, especially with the added pressure of managing your health.

First of all, let's acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious in this situation. The fact that you're showing up to work despite the nerves (and, ahem, the puking) is a massive accomplishment. It takes a lot of courage to face your fears like this.

One thing that might help is to focus on the small wins, like you did after the first two days. You survived, and that's something to be proud of! Try to break down your goals into smaller, manageable chunks, and celebrate each tiny victory. And hey, if puking before work becomes a thing, maybe just consider it a weird pre-game ritual.

You got this, and you're not alone. Keep pushing forward, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're doing great, and I'm rooting for you!""","

8xlqik,Anxiety,Guys‚Äîfor the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,breadplane,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there‚Äôs no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like ‚Äúoh no you don‚Äôt!‚Äù I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy‚Äînamely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I‚Äôm so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you‚Äôve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this!

One thing that's helped me is to remind myself that these physical symptoms are not a sign of some underlying illness, but actually just my body's way of responding to stress and anxiety. It sounds silly, but just knowing that has helped me calm down a bit when I start to feel those symptoms coming on.

Also, have you tried keeping a symptom journal? Writing down when your symptoms occur and what might be triggering them can really help you identify patterns and find ways to manage them better. And don't forget to be kind to yourself - it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's not your fault that your body is responding this way. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through it.","

bdoulg,Anxiety,Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?,whoreyinthehouse,"I‚Äôve been anxious since I was a kid. It‚Äôs been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. 
I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my ‚Äúadult life‚Äù. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it‚Äôs an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?",845,163,1555382992,"This can be normal with anxiety. Your body is in ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. It‚Äôs reserving it‚Äôs energy for ‚Äòbattle‚Äô essentially. 

Try to drink juice or something to keep your blood sugar in check. And if this goes on to be an every day thing, see a professional for advice!",93,thesicknurse,"Yes. I call it stress starve, the opposite of stress eat.",31,AgentMintyHippo,"Hey OP, I'm so glad you shared this - it takes a lot of courage to talk about your struggles with anxiety. I definitely relate to losing my appetite when I'm feeling anxious or stressed. It's like my brain just can't handle the thought of food, and even the smallest amounts can feel overwhelming.

First of all, congratulations on graduating from college! That's a huge achievement, and it's understandable that you're feeling anxious about the next chapter of your life.

As for dealing with the loss of appetite, I've found that it helps to focus on small, frequent meals throughout the day. Sometimes, when I'm feeling really anxious, I'll make a smoothie or some toast with avocado - something light and easy to digest. I also try to prioritize self-care, like taking walks or practicing deep breathing exercises, to help manage my anxiety.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's great that you're recognizing the unhealthy consequences of your anxiety. You don't have to face this alone - consider talking to a therapist or a trusted friend/family member about how you're feeling. Take care of yourself, and remember that you're not alone in this.","

I've experienced something similar, and it's like my brain automatically goes into 'danger mode' when I hear yelling, even if it's not directed at me. I've talked to a therapist about this, and they think it might be related to the emotional association we create with yelling - often, it's linked to conflict, anger, or fear.

Given your history of traumatic experiences, it's possible that your brain is just being extra cautious as a way to protect you. It's like your nervous system is constantly on the lookout for potential threats.

A strategy that's helped me is to acknowledge and validate my feelings when I start to feel anxious. I remind myself that I'm safe, and that the yelling isn't about me. It's also helpful to take a few deep breaths, step away from the situation if possible, and focus on something calming.

You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're reaching out to talk about it. Remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being.","

Has anyone else experienced this before? How did you deal with it?",917,87,1616399487,"I often re-read and re-read before pressing the ‚Äòsend‚Äô button.  talking about work email, of course.

I've been there too, and it's crazy how something as simple as replying to a message can turn into this huge mental hurdle. I think what helps is recognizing that it's not about the message itself, but about the pressure we put on ourselves to respond perfectly. 

One thing that worked for me is to set a timer for 10 minutes and challenge myself to respond to as many messages as I can during that time. It's almost like a game, and it helps me get into a flow state where I'm not overthinking every response.

Another thing is to remind myself that it's okay to keep it simple. I don't need to craft the perfect response every time. A quick ""hey, how's it going?"" or ""thanks for reaching out"" can go a long way.

Lastly, try to be kind to yourself when you do finally respond late. Remember that the other person probably isn't even thinking about it, and they'll likely appreciate the response whenever it comes.

You're not alone in this, and it's not something to be ashamed of. Just take it one message at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself.","

One thing that's helped me is to think of my meds as just one tool in my anxiety-management toolkit. While they might not 'calm the screaming,' they can give me the space to work on other stuff that can actually help calm it down, like therapy, mindfulness, and self-care.

It might be worth talking to your doctor or therapist about adding some other strategies to your routine. Maybe there are some coping mechanisms or techniques that can help you deal with the screaming toddler in your ear. And hey, even if the meds don't completely eliminate the anxiety, it's still okay to take them and use them to your advantage. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

n1hyeq,Anxiety,Does anyone else intentionally act a bit dumber just to avoid having to talk too much in conversations?,LilNephew,"Sometimes maybe say if you were in a conversation with someone/people you‚Äôre not comfortable with and you will not offer your whole stance on a topic or even sometimes act like you know nothing (when you do) just to avoid to have to talk, or come off the wrong way

Coincidence? Maybe.
Cheers from Per√∫, SA have a relaxing night too!",4,Fox-SAF,"It seems like you're sending some love to someone special, and that's really sweet. I'm going to take a guess that you might be in a long-distance relationship or just wanted to show your appreciation from afar.

First of all, that's a beautiful gesture, and I'm sure the person on the receiving end will appreciate the thought. If you are in a long-distance relationship, it's great that you're making an effort to stay connected and show your love.

My advice would be to not underestimate the power of small gestures like this. A simple message or a kind word can go a long way in keeping the spark alive in a relationship. Keep being your caring and thoughtful self, and I'm sure your partner will appreciate it.

If you don't mind me asking, what's the story behind your message? Is there something special that inspired you to reach out tonight?","

vgn1l8,Anxiety,I'm sick of people assuming anxiety can't be a serious mental illness.,nada_alem_disto,"At some point I couldn't leave my house, couldn't be left alone at any moment, cried compulsively all day, couldn't eat, couldn't listen to music, watch TV, read, brush my teeth, eat or take off my pyjamas. I was dizzy the whole time and my vision was blurred. I had hot flashes, a rapid heartbeat, tingles all over my body and intense headaches all the time.

And there are people out there who have experienced a lot worse than I did, people whose pain I can't even imagine... And some people still say stuff like ""oh you only have anxiety"", ""why didn't you just try harder?"", ""anxiety is not that bad to have"" and my absolute most hated ""anxiety is not an illness"".

No, I'm sitting here in bed hours before my shift contemplating my life while switching between chest pains, hyperventilating, crying, and more. I don't want this. I didn't choose it. I wish I could ""just go to work and deal with it"".

Sorry you feel this way and are dealing with this. At least You're among a more sympathetic and empathetic crowd here.",148,EntBlossom,"I understand what you mean completely - there is so much stigma and condescending comments even from people within the mental health community, but having a anxiety disorder that‚Äôs severe can be so debilitating and really impact someone‚Äôs life negatively so I‚Äôm always confused when people compare anxiety to be a ‚Äòmild‚Äô illness. It‚Äôs probably because to an extent everyone has anxiety but having an anxiety disorder is different so people getting confused, also while everyone deserves help having a mild anxiety disorder is a completely different thing than having a severe one. The same thing probably happens with depression and sadness.",44,neubella,"I completely understand why you're frustrated, and I'm so sorry you've had to go through that. It's infuriating when people downplay or dismiss the severity of anxiety. The truth is, anxiety can be debilitating and life-altering, just like any other serious mental illness. Your experience is a perfect example of that.

First of all, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. There are many people who understand and validate your struggles. It's essential to surround yourself with those who get it and can offer support.

As for the people who don't understand, try not to take their words personally. Often, their ignorance stems from a lack of education or personal experience. You can't change their minds, but you can control how you react to them. Instead of engaging, focus on nurturing relationships with people who uplift and support you.

Remember, your anxiety is real, and your struggles are valid. Don't let anyone diminish that. Keep pushing forward, and know that there's a community here that has your back.","

I can totally relate to the anxiety that comes with birthdays - the pressure to plan something, the fear of being forgotten, or worse, being the center of attention. It's amazing that you took a leap of faith this year and shared your special day with people at work and online.

It's incredible how liberating it can feel to let down our walls and be vulnerable. By doing so, you've not only enjoyed your birthday for the first time in a while, but you've also strengthened your connections with others. That takes a lot of courage, and I'm so proud of you for taking that step.

Remember, your worth and value come from who you are as a person, not from the number of people who celebrate your birthday.

My teeth are in a world of hurt today.,861,141,1558091944,I try to remind myself every few minutes while I'm awake to unclench my jaw.,173,karenaviva,,0,,"I totally feel you. I've been there too - waking up with a throbbing jaw and teeth that feel like they've been put through a wringer. It's like your body is holding onto stress and anxiety, and your jaw just decides to take the hit.

For me, it's been a combination of relaxation techniques that have helped. I try to practice deep breathing exercises before bed, and I've also started using a mouthguard at night to prevent grinding. It's not the most glamorous thing, but it's been a game-changer. I've also found that regular massages can help loosen up the tension in my jaw and face.

It might be worth looking into some stress-reducing activities during the day too - like yoga or meditation. It's not about eliminating stress entirely, but finding ways to manage it so it doesn't manifest in your jaw. Hope you feel better soon, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more advice or just need someone to vent to.","

ca8lmg,Anxiety,Anyone else‚Äôs anxiety make them doubt/ second guess every choice they make/ made?,minookitty,I feel like my anxiety casts every decision I made or make into doubt. For example recently I quit a job for another job. I really did not like the job I quit and was stressed and unhappy all the time and job hunting for nearly the whole time I was there. There were real reasons why it was dysfunctional but my anxiety makes it so I can‚Äôt tell what was me and what was it. was I overly sensitive and bothered about things other people would have been ok with? Now the new job is causing me that same tick tick stress and dislike that I can‚Äôt compartmentalize and I feel like maybe the whole change was for nothing. Like I can‚Äôt tell where my anxiety stops and real feelings begin,953,49,1562516464,"It took me far too long to leave my previous toxic job for partially this reason - I couldn't tell if the constant feeling of failure was me being overly sensitive to the ""feedback"" I was being given or if it was valid and I was terrible at my job.  When the so-called feedback turned into what seemed more verbal abuse, it still took months to leave.  My coworkers and family tried to hard to make me see that this wasn't right but my brain didn't want to accept it.  It's always been hard for me to believe that my feelings are real and valid.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now, several years after I finally left that cesspool, I still wonder if it was just me being too sensitive and if I should have stuck it out longer.",52,ardhrianna,"Is it the job that makes you feel stressed or the people around you? I had similar issues but then I realized that what causes my stress were the people me. Try to find a job that you actually like doing and when people there starts to stress you out again, think about that you came there for the job and focus on finishing the task.",4,ValkyrieWuShen,"I completely get where you're coming from - it sounds like a really tough spot to be in. I've been there too, where anxiety makes it impossible to separate my own feelings from the noise in my head. 

One thing that's helped me is trying to focus on the facts, rather than the feelings. When you made the decision to quit your old job, what were the concrete reasons behind it? What specific things were causing you stress and unhappiness? Writing those things down might help you see that your decision wasn't just based on anxiety, but on real problems.

It's also worth reminding yourself that it's okay to take time to adjust to a new job. It's normal to feel uncertain or stressed in a new environment. Maybe this new job isn't perfect, but that doesn't mean the decision to leave the old one was wrong.

Remember that your anxiety is just one voice in your head - it's not the only one, and it's not always the most reliable. You made the decision to leave for a reason, and that reason is still valid, even if your anxiety tries to tell you otherwise.","

Do you suffer from social anxiety or extremely shyness as well?",19,GidOff_MuLawn,"""Hey OP, I totally get it. I used to be terrified of phone calls too. The 'putting you on the spot' aspect really hits the nail on the head - it's like you're suddenly on stage without a script. I think for a lot of people, it's the lack of control and visibility that comes with phone calls. You can't see the other person's reactions or body language, and you can't easily pause or edit your responses.

One thing that helped me was to prepare ahead of time, whether it's making a list of questions to ask or practicing what I want to say. It also helped to remind myself that phone calls are just conversations, and it's okay to pause or ask for clarification if I need to.

Another thing you might try is to start small - make a few low-stakes calls, like ordering food or calling a friend, to get comfortable with the feeling of being on the phone. And hey, if all else fails, you can always try to shift the conversation to a different medium, like email or messaging. You're not alone in this, and it's totally manageable with time and practice.""","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else fear phonecalls?

POST BODY: Basically, I have to admit, I struggle with calls, whether it's incoming or if I have to make one. I become all hot and shivery all of the sudden, and I can feel my pulse going nuts. It's something confronting, ""putting you on the spot"" about calls, that makes me extremely nervous - it's like taking oral exam without having prepared for it. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have ideas on why this fear might exist or how to overcome it?

cqhkc3,Anxiety,I brushed my teeth!,littlemonsteress,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved.",924,75,1565824368,"That's a great habit to get into. Keep it up, I'm rooting for you!",131,Nwsamurai,"Grats and keep it up. Dental health is extremely important. Look into a waterpik, flossing is importsnt as well.",24,Woopdaddy12,"I'm so proud of you for taking this huge step. It's amazing how something as simple as brushing your teeth can feel like a monumental task when you're struggling with depression and anxiety. The fact that you've been carrying this weight for months and still managed to push through and do something about it is truly admirable.

That your dentist praised your teeth and a friend's training stuck with you is a testament to the fact that you've been wanting to make a change, but maybe just needed a little push. Now that you've taken the first step, I encourage you to be kind to yourself and celebrate these small victories. It's okay to not have it all together, and it's amazing that you're taking care of yourself in this way.

That Alarmy reminder is a genius idea, by the way. Remember, every small step counts, and you've already made progress just by showing up and trying. Keep going, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. You've got this.","

ezw6we,Anxiety,Ever have days where your anxiety is incredibly high for absolutely no reason?,DruncleBuck,Yeah. It‚Äôs one of those days.,909,89,1581012284,"I woke up and knew immediately I needed to be underneath the covers, unfortunately I can't call out unless deathly ill.",98,enolafaye,"I woke up and knew immediately I needed to be underneath the covers, unfortunately I can't call out unless deathly ill.",98,enolafaye,"I totally get it. Those days can be super frustrating and overwhelming, especially when you can't pinpoint a specific reason for the anxiety. It's like your brain just decides to go into overdrive, and you're left feeling helpless.

First of all, just know that you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be super unpredictable, and it's normal to have days like this. One thing that might help is to take a step back, breathe, and try to focus on the present moment. I know it sounds clich√©, but mindfulness can be a game-changer on days like this. Try to let go of any thoughts or worries about the future or past, and just focus on what you can control in the present.

Also, be kind to yourself today. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions come up, and don't beat yourself up over it. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that this too shall pass. Hang in there, and know that better days are ahead. Sending you all the calm vibes today!","

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. But you‚Äôre not alone and we are here for you.

If you ever want to chat dm me (no pressure)",24,[deleted],"I totally get where you're coming from. It can be really tough to deal with feelings of self-doubt and social anxiety. First, just want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean you're a bad person. It's actually a pretty common experience, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking. When we're feeling anxious or insecure, it's easy to assume the worst about how others see us. But the truth is, most people are too caught up in their own stuff to be paying that much attention to us. They might not even notice the things that make you feel like a disruption.

I'd also encourage you to reach out to a trusted friend or family member, or even a therapist, to talk through these feelings. Sometimes just sharing what's going on can help you gain a new perspective and feel more connected to others. You don't have to go through this alone.","

In the meantime, while you wait to talk to your doctor, try to focus on self-care and relaxation techniques. Take those big breaths, do some gentle stretches, and try to get some rest. Your body is sending you signals, but it might not be as dire as you think. 

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's great that you're reaching out for support. Try to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. You got this, and your doctor will help you figure out what's going on soon. Hang in there!","

Here's the thing: you can't control how others react, but you can control how you respond. Take a step back, breathe, and remind yourself why you posted in the first place - to discuss something you care about. Try not to take the negativity personally (easier said than done, I know).

If someone's being rude, you don't have to engage. You can ignore the comment or report it if it's really crossing a line. And if you do feel the need to respond, try to keep it civil and focused on the topic at hand.

Don't delete your post, though! Your voice matters, and there are probably plenty of people who appreciate your thoughts and insights. Keep sharing, and don't let the trolls get you down.","

POST TITLE: Anyone else get anxiety over just making a Reddit post?

POST BODY: It seems when I want to post something, I'm excited about it because it's a subject of interest and I want to discuss it. But then when I post it and get replies..there's always at least one person who is really rude and implies that whatever Im talking about is dumb. 

Then I get anxiety. I get defensive at times too. Sometimes I get close to deleting the post because I don't like people disrespecting me when I know damn well I don't deserve it

cc7boe,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,symph0nica,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",915,79,1562913742,All the time. Even when productive I don‚Äôt feel enough is coming out of my hands.,94,jojowiththeflow,"That's not anxiety, you're just excited to do something. 
Start doing something and you will feel great.",-5,LikeHarambeMemes,"Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. The feeling of wasting time can be a huge anxiety trigger, especially when you're trying to make the most of your free time. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be productive, which can be paralyzing.

First of all, it's essential to recognize that downtime is not inherently ""wasted"" time. Your brain needs time to relax and recharge, and scrolling through Reddit or watching YouTube videos can be a legitimate way to do that. Maybe instead of beating yourself up over it, you could try setting aside specific times for relaxation and specific times for productivity?

Also, try to reframe your thinking around failure and learning new skills. The fact that you're thinking about learning Unity and HTML/CSS means you're already taking steps towards personal growth. It's okay to start small and make mistakes ‚Äì that's all part of the learning process. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.","

bfvh2i,Anxiety,Anxiety robbed me of my personality,pxuline,"And the more I think of this, the more depressed I feel that anxiety has become such a huge part of my life that I forget who I am without it.

I miss her so much.",924,70,1555891573,I've let it consume my life far too much.,156,selfimprovementbitch,,0,,"I can only imagine how disheartening it must feel to feel like anxiety has hijacked your sense of self. It's like you're living in a constant state of 'survival mode' instead of truly being yourself. 

First of all, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people with anxiety struggle to reconcile their pre-anxiety selves with their current reality. It's like there's this deep-seated fear that the anxiety has become an integral part of who you are.

Here's the thing: your anxiety doesn't define you. It's a part of your experience, but it's not the entirety of your identity. I'd encourage you to try and tap back into the things that brought you joy before anxiety took hold. What were your hobbies, interests, or passions? Reconnecting with those might help you regain a sense of your 'pre-anxiety' self.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to 'find yourself' overnight. It's a process, and it's okay to stumble. You're not lost; you're just navigating a difficult chapter in your life. Keep moving forward, and know that you're not alone.","

Anxiety people are very sensitive to the way our brain chemistry runs that's why every little thing makes a too big impression and overwhelms you. When you work against things that trigger anxiety you become ""stronger"" against it in the same way that being good at playing guitar gives you harder fingertips. You gear up the body better for it, and cold is a similar sensation, because it over-over-stimulates the nerves and makes you less sensitive to further sensation for a while.",11,linkenski,"""I totally get it, and it's awesome that you found something that helped calm your anxiety. The walk-in freezer thing might sound weird to some people, but I think it's a great example of how our brains and bodies can respond to different stimuli in unique ways.

It's probably a combination of both the alone time and the cold air that helped. Cold temperatures can slow down your heart rate and breathing, which can be really calming. And having a few minutes to yourself can give you space to collect your thoughts and regulate your emotions.

If you're no longer working at the restaurant, you might want to try replicating this effect in other ways, like taking cold showers or going for a walk outside on a chilly day. There are also some great breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques that can help calm anxiety. Just wanted to say thanks for sharing your experience, and I'm glad you've found some relief with meds and other strategies.""","

Are you putting pressure on yourself to be more social or productive? Sometimes, our evening anxiety can be a sign that we need to slow down and be kinder to ourselves.

Try to create some calming pre-bedtime routines that help you unwind, like reading, meditation, or a warm bath.

Since you mentioned the side effects might mimic your anxiety symptoms, it might be helpful to keep a symptom journal for the next few days. That way, you can track how you're feeling and distinguish between what's anxiety and what might be vaccine-related. Just a thought.

g4y8e7,Anxiety,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity",AbsoluteZeroGravity,"I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?",830,159,1587406963,"I really relate to this, I also was a ""gifted"" kid. Everything came easily to me until college.  I wasnt used to being challenged or having to actually study. On top of having had high expectations for myself, I developed anxiety and depression which fucked up my memory. Now, I feel like I cant learn anything let alone want to. I failed all of my college courses and I dropped out, because I couldnt handle the pressue. I feel like a complete failure.",257,dastardly-bastard-,,0,,"I can totally relate to your experience. I was also considered ""gifted"" in grade school, and it's like I was living on autopilot, effortlessly acing everything without much effort. But when I hit college, everything changed. The material got tougher, and I found myself struggling to keep up.

I think what's important to remember is that being ""gifted"" doesn't mean you're inherently smarter or more capable than others. It just means you might have had a head start or a different learning style. And that's okay. It's normal to struggle and have to work harder as the material gets more challenging.

One thing that helped me was reframing my mindset. Instead of focusing on being ""gifted"" or ""smart,"" I started focusing on being curious and interested in the material. I allowed myself to ask questions, seek help, and explore topics that genuinely fascinated me. It's okay to not know everything, and it's okay to make mistakes.

Remember, your worth and intelligence aren't defined by your grades or performance. You're not ""stupid"" just because you're facing challenges now. You're growing, and that's a beautiful thing.","

POST BODY: I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?

lqvlhu,Anxiety,"Does anyone just wonder at the end of a long day: ""dang, I really have to do this all again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that...?",Bring_me_the_lads,"Sometimes always being stressed out makes the days seem so much longer. I guess I just wish I could have a break from my anxiety. It really sucks because you have to go to bed knowing you're literally walking right into another stressful day, but like, what choice do we have?",939,50,1614121085,Giving you a hug. I definitely can relate to this. I always tell myself: ‚ÄúI just gotta get through this week‚Äù but then it‚Äôs every week. It‚Äôs tough but I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôll get better soon.,80,deviltriggerv,Have you tried working out? I mean exercise? Like gym 3 times a week? Please tell.,0,dare_acoustic,"I feel you, OP. It's like being stuck on a never-ending hamster wheel, and it's exhausting. I've had days where the anxiety just feels suffocating, and all I can think about is how I have to do it all again the next day. It's a vicious cycle.

But here's the thing: you don't have to face it alone. Have you tried breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks? Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's because we're looking at the big picture. By focusing on one task at a time, you can make it feel less daunting.

Also, don't underestimate the power of self-care. Whether it's reading a book, taking a walk, or practicing some deep breathing exercises, make time for things that bring you calm and relaxation. And hey, it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to take a step back and say, ""You know what? I need a break."" You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Hang in there, friend.","

It's amazing that you're recognizing the importance of self-care, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this.

Remember that you don't have to justify or explain your feelings to anyone, especially not to those who don't understand.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's possible some people might reach out to you directly (e.g., via email or text) to reconnect or ask why you're no longer on social media.

I think a big part of the problem is that people don't understand what they can't see. Anxiety and panic disorders are invisible illnesses, and it's hard for others to grasp the severity of our struggles. But that's no excuse for being cruel or dismissive.

If I could offer any advice, it's to try not to internalize those hurtful comments. Remember that their behavior is a reflection of themselves, not you. Surround yourself with people who do get it, who are empathetic and supportive. And don't be afraid to speak up for yourself ‚Äì your feelings are valid, and you deserve to be heard.

My son was watching TV in the next room and I could hear him. So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid.",890,97,1484231740,That kid sounds amazing. I don't have kids yet but I sometimes worry about how they will view my anxiety when I decide to have them.,170,enolafaye,"After reading through these comments I can understand why you're feeling very defensive right now. But I can understand where these people are coming from and as yet another example of a child who had to take care of her mother, I just have to stand up for these people offering these words of caution. 

You've shared this story as a heartwarming, positive tale. And it is. Sort of. There's a lot of people commenting who are basically taking this as something to strive for in their relationships with their children, and that's the issue here. The people who are offering criticisms are just trying to make it loud and clear that while yes, it's sweet that your child offered you comfort, it's also a dangerous trend to set. I can't speak to how your child felt but I'd expect that most would feel a little scared by seeing their parent in such a state. You've made it very clear that you usually shield him from that, we've heard that loud and clear. 

But *in general* it should really be known that this is not a good road to go down. I really think that's all the naysayers are trying to get across, so please try not to take it as an attack. ",7,kelz0r,"I can only imagine how overwhelming it must have been to experience an anxiety attack, especially with a little one nearby. But it's amazing to see how your son responded - it's clear he's picked up on your emotions and is already learning empathy.

It's incredible that at such a young age, he's able to sense your distress and try to comfort you. That kiss on the forehead and playing quietly beside you is more than just sweet - it's a sign that he's developing essential emotional intelligence. It's not just about what you've done ""right"" as a parent, but also about the natural bond you share with your child.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's amazing that you're taking steps to manage your anxiety. Don't hesitate to prioritize your own well-being, and know that your son will continue to learn and grow from your experiences. You're doing great, and it's beautiful to see your little one supporting you along the way.","

I've been there too, especially during stressful periods in college. It's like your brain just won't shut off, and the more you try to relax, the more your anxiety spirals. By exhausting yourself, you're basically forcing your brain to take a break, which can be a temporary solution.

However, I want to gently suggest that this might not be the most sustainable approach in the long run. Chronic sleep deprivation can exacerbate anxiety and affect your overall well-being. Have you considered trying relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, to help calm your mind before bed? These can be super helpful in quieting your thoughts and making it easier to fall asleep.

It's great that you're acknowledging your anxiety and finding ways to cope, though. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. If you ever need someone to talk to or just need some support, don't hesitate to reach out.","

I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when it's something important like a presentation. Your body's physical reactions are just a sign that you're invested in the outcome, and that's a good thing.

One thing that might help next time (because let's be real, there will be a next time) is to try to reframe those physical symptoms as excitement rather than anxiety. Instead of thinking ""my heart is pounding because I'm nervous,"" try telling yourself ""my heart is pounding because I'm about to nail this.""

I was quite anxious as I‚Äôm still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I‚Äôve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, ‚Äúoh god, you‚Äôre bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.‚Äù I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a ‚Äúshout out‚Äù because I handled the tough questions ‚Äúlike a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.‚Äù She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù he‚Äôd seen and he‚Äôd found it ‚Äúextremely useful and insightful‚Äù. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else‚Äôs.

I've been there too, convinced that I've failed or bombed, only to find out later that everyone else thought I did great.

I think the key takeaway here is that our perception is not always the truth. And that's so hard to remember when we're in the midst of anxiety. But it's exactly what you did - you pushed through and kept going, despite what your anxiety was telling you. And look at the amazing outcome!

Your story is a great reminder that we should try to separate our anxiety from reality. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.

eebgko,Anxiety,Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,ClearBlue_Grace,"It‚Äôs a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It‚Äôs not a stomachache, or cramping, or ‚Äúmaybe I ate something bad‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I‚Äôve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it‚Äôs likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn‚Äôt change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don‚Äôt even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don‚Äôt need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I‚Äôm just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn‚Äôt going to fix it. No, I can‚Äôt just ‚Äústop worrying‚Äù, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don‚Äôt help.",827,155,1577054209,"Yeah, same. My husband doesnt have anxiety and I told him I feel like I'm going down hill on a roller coaster....all the time. It's awful.",106,blc1234,"Yeah, same. My husband doesnt have anxiety and I told him I feel like I'm going down hill on a roller coaster....all the time. It's awful.",106,blc1234,"I totally get why this symptom is the most debilitating for you - it's like your body is physically reacting to your anxiety, making it impossible to escape or ignore. I've been there too, and it's incredibly isolating when people don't understand that it's not just a matter of ""calming down"" or ""eating something to settle your stomach.""

One thing that might help (not fix, but help) is to try to separate your anxiety from your physical sensations. When you feel that stomach-churning sensation, try to acknowledge it as a physical response to your anxiety, rather than the anxiety itself. It's like your body is having a panic attack, but your mind doesn't have to follow. It's a subtle distinction, but it can help you feel more in control.

POST TITLE: Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?

POST BODY: It‚Äôs a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It‚Äôs not a stomachache, or cramping, or ‚Äúmaybe I ate something bad‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I‚Äôve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it‚Äôs likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn‚Äôt change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don‚Äôt even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don‚Äôt need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I‚Äôm just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn‚Äôt going to fix it. No, I can‚Äôt just ‚Äústop worrying‚Äù, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don‚Äôt help.

It's amazing how sometimes the smallest victories can bring the biggest sense of pride and accomplishment. I totally get why you'd feel giddy about it - it's a big deal, even if it might seem small to others.

I love that you just went for it, even when you weren't entirely sure what you were getting. That takes a lot of courage, and it's something to be proud of. It's also a great reminder that it's okay to not have everything figured out - sometimes just taking action and being willing to try something new is enough.

Keep celebrating those small wins, and don't be afraid to share them with others. You never know who might be inspired by your story. What's the pretzel like, btw?""","

Even the ones I enjoy. It‚Äôs not an anxiety thing for me, because I‚Äôm comfortable socializing, it‚Äôs just tiring. I always build time into my schedule  to decompress and recharge by myself.

You might be an introvert.

Working seven hours straight without breaks is also itself a challenge though.",146,InTheFlesk,,0,,"Hey there, congratulations on the new job. I totally get what you're going through. As an introvert, I've had similar experiences in highly social roles, and it can be draining. It's like you're constantly 'on' and can't recharge.

Firstly, please know that it's normal to feel overwhelmed, especially in a new job. It's great that you're recognizing your limits and taking care of yourself. Those breakdowns might be a sign that you need to prioritize self-care and find ways to recharge, even if it's just a few minutes of quiet time during the day.

Consider speaking with your manager about flexible breaks or finding ways to take short pauses during busy periods. They might be more understanding than you think. Also, explore stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or journaling to help you cope.

Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging your feelings. You got this, and it's just a matter of finding ways to manage your energy and prioritize your well-being. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further support.","

I love the way you phrased 'whatever is stressing you can wait for a few minutes.' That's so true. Our problems will still be there when we're done taking a few deep breaths, but we'll be better equipped to tackle them with a clear head.

For anyone struggling to quiet their mind, I also want to suggest trying a body scan. Lie down or sit comfortably, and bring your attention to different parts of your body, starting from your toes and working your way up. It's amazing how much tension we hold in our bodies, and releasing it can be incredibly liberating. Thanks again for the reminder, OP. Sending you all calm vibes.""","

a0k03f,Anxiety,A cool anxiety technique I learned,theWinterDojer,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!",904,75,1543244207,Love this.   And testing the theory ,65,palmcitytiki,Thanks!  I'm willing to try just about anything. ,2,NiceIce,"I love this technique, OP. I've tried similar visualization methods in the past, and it's amazing how powerful our minds can be when we take control of our anxiety. The idea of giving your anxiety a shape, color, or face and then altering it to something more calming is genius. It's like rewriting the narrative of our anxiety, and it can be really empowering.

I especially appreciate your edit with the example - it helps to illustrate the concept and makes it more relatable. I've found that having a clear mental image can make all the difference in shifting our mindset.

One thing that might be helpful to add to this technique is to practice self-compassion while doing it. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious, and that you're doing the best you can. It's not about eliminating anxiety entirely, but about learning to manage it and be kind to yourself in the process.

Thanks for sharing this technique, OP. It's definitely something I'll be trying out again, and I appreciate your willingness to help others.","

cfbfvy,Anxiety,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,dumbjokes101,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it",929,49,1563561893,"this is the type of wholesome content I needed today. 

Hold that boy close and never let him go.",264,slayinscience,,0,,"I can only imagine how vulnerable and scared you must have felt having your first anxiety attack in front of your boyfriend. It's completely normal to worry about how the other person will react, especially when you're still getting used to being open about your anxiety.

It sounds like your boyfriend handled the situation perfectly - being supportive, understanding, and respectful of your boundaries. His actions show that he's genuinely invested in your well-being and cares about making you feel safe.

A huge takeaway from this experience is that your boyfriend's reaction was not about you being ""broken"" or ""weak,"" but about him being a caring and empathetic partner. It's a great sign for your relationship, and I'm sure it will help you feel more comfortable being open about your anxiety in the future.

Remember that having anxiety doesn't define your worth, and it's okay to have moments like these. You're lucky to have a supportive partner, and I'm sure he feels lucky to have you too.","

or3og2,Anxiety,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,BeginningIcy3816,"It‚Äôs so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It‚Äôs just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I‚Äôve made immense progress but it‚Äôs never going to be normal again. I can‚Äôt stop feeling guilty for everything I‚Äôve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I‚Äôm worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can‚Äôt let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn‚Äôt even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I‚Äôm tired of thoughts that I‚Äôm a horrible person. I‚Äôm just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I‚Äôm in a group of people having fun. And I‚Äôm able to make them laugh. Whenever I‚Äôm alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I‚Äôm worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there‚Äôs gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It‚Äôs just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I‚Äôm kinda thinking this might be because I‚Äôve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I‚Äôm so nervous I can‚Äôt stop hyper focusing on one situation and it‚Äôs been a year and it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors.",920,58,1627181851,"You aren't high maintenance. You have anxiety. Your brain is lying to you, but you don't know that in the moment. I've been there. I thought those thoughts were normal. I thought it was normal to constantly think others were talking about me. I thought it was normal to relive conversations from years ago. I thought it was normal to constantly worry about whether my boyfriend (now husband) actually loved me.

The only thing that truly helped was medication. A daily med as well as a rescue med for anxiety attacks. The right meds and the right dosage made a world of difference for me. The vast majority of those thoughts stopped or were at least easier to manage. I'm currently off medication and doing well, but there is no shame in medication.",108,readrunrescue,[deleted],14,[deleted],"""Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of anxiety, people-pleasing, and rumination. First of all, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of getting back on your anxiety meds - that's a huge step.

It's understandable that you feel the need for reassurance, but like you said, it's a short-lasting fix. One thing that might help is practicing self-compassion and challenging those negative thoughts that tell you you're a horrible person. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay not to be perfect.

Your coping mechanisms, like checking if people have blocked you or browsing Mercari for squishmallows, might seem quirky, but hey, if they work for you, that's all that matters. Maybe try to expand on those calming activities and see if you can find more ways to soothe yourself when you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Keep moving forward, and remember that you're doing the best you can.""","

Life is just not enjoyable when I'm constantly running on anxiety.,117,MagicCandy,,0,,"I totally get it. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of temporal anxiety. It's like you're feeling the weight of every minute, and the fear of wasting time is overwhelming. I've been there too.

Firstly, try to acknowledge that it's normal to have downtime, and it's not always 'wasted.' Sometimes, we need to relax and recharge. Maybe try to reframe your thinking - instead of seeing downtime as 'wasted,' see it as a necessary part of your day.

Also, consider setting realistic goals for your day, rather than overplanning. Leave some buffer time in between tasks for flexibility. Remember, it's okay to not be 100% productive all the time.

Lastly, practice self-compassion. When you notice yourself getting anxious about time, take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay to slow down. You're not defined by your productivity, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

You're not alone in this feeling, and it's great that you're recognizing it. Keep working on it, and remember to be kind to yourself.","

I can totally understand why you'd want to warn others - energy drinks can be a serious trigger for anxiety. 

First, take a deep breath and know that this will pass. It's probably the caffeine and other stimulants in the energy drink that are causing your body to freak out. Try to find a quiet, calm space to sit and focus on your breathing. Sometimes, progressive muscle relaxation can help - tense and then relax different muscle groups to release the physical tension.

In terms of managing your anxiety, it might be helpful to talk to a doctor or therapist about strategies for coping with anxiety attacks. They can also help you identify what triggers them, so you can avoid energy drinks (and maybe other things) in the future.

Hang in there - you're not alone, and this will pass.","

jb4pzf,Anxiety,I finally talked to my doctor about anxiety -he told me to try a meditation app.,FacelessOldWoman1234,"I've had anxiety for years and it's been getting worse and worse. Finally I got up the courage to call my doctor. I told him everything, and went through some questionnaires with him.  He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal.""

Giving the app a go might not be a bad idea.

You're within your rights to ask for another opinion, from a different doctor. Even if 6 hours of sleep is deemed normal, it is still affecting your wellbeing and should therefore be taken seriously.

You deserve to have your concerns heard and treated as important.",308,meekomania,Any doctor that says 6 hours of sleep a night is enough is not educated enough to hold the title of doctor imo. I would seek a second opinion from a doctor that knows what they are doing,6,pritch_dawg,"I totally get why you'd feel discouraged after that conversation. It sounds like you were really hoping for a more comprehensive plan to tackle your anxiety, and instead, it felt like your concerns were minimized.

First of all, kudos to you for speaking up and seeking help - that's a huge step. I think it's great that you're willing to give your doctor the benefit of the doubt and try again. It's possible that he's just starting with some low-hanging fruit (like the meditation app) before moving on to more intensive treatments.

In the meantime, it might be worth exploring some other sleep hygiene strategies to see if you can improve your sleep quality. There are tons of resources online, from establishing a bedtime routine to creating a sleep-conducive environment. You could also try journaling or talking to a therapist to help process your anxiety and work through some of the underlying issues.

Remember that you're not alone in this, and it's okay to advocate for yourself and seek out additional support if you need it. Keep pushing forward, and don't give up - you got this!","

POST TITLE: I finally talked to my doctor about anxiety -he told me to try a meditation app.

POST BODY: I've had anxiety for years and it's been getting worse and worse. Finally I got up the courage to call my doctor. I told him everything, and went through some questionnaires with him.  He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal."" 

I feel really discouraged.

hn7wgd,Anxiety,"Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an ""event""...ANY event?",Cautious-Discount,"Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?",917,60,1594172541,[deleted],102,[deleted],Would you care to talk about how you cope with your anxiety?,1,cleverbeavercleaver,"I totally get what you're going through. It sounds like you're experiencing some anticipatory anxiety, which is pretty common, especially when there's something significant or out of the ordinary happening (even if it's something as low-key as a birthday).

Firstly, let's separate excitement from anxiety - they can feel similar, but they're not the same thing. Anxiety often involves a sense of unease or worry, whereas excitement is more of a positive, energized feeing.

It's possible that your brain is just wired to respond to any kind of ""event"" (even a birthday with no plans) with a bit of tension. This doesn't necessarily mean you're excited, but rather that your brain is just preparing for something out of the ordinary.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking around these events. Instead of focusing on the anxiety, try to acknowledge it and remind yourself that it's just your brain's way of preparing for something new. Take some deep breaths, and try to focus on the present moment. You might also consider talking to a therapist to work through some of these feelings. You're not alone in this, and it's totally manageable.","

One thing that might help you build on this success is to practice ordering in low-stakes situations, like when you're alone or with a friend who's supportive. The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll become.

Also, remember that it's okay to make mistakes or ask for clarification. The person taking your order is just doing their job, and they're not judging you.

Here's a thought: what if you didn't wait for the anxiety to disappear? What if you took small steps towards these goals now, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable? It might be as simple as sending a text to an old friend, or looking up job listings online. You don't have to tackle everything at once, but taking small actions can help you build momentum and confidence. Just something to consider. You got this.","

edx16n,Anxiety,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,DevilAngel9,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain &lt;3

Well done!",5,AHippyInLeeds,"""Huge congratulations to you on reaching this incredible milestone - a whole year without self-harming is something to be incredibly proud of.

Your story is a powerful reminder that recovery is possible, and that it's never too late to seek help. If you don't mind me saying, your honesty and vulnerability are really inspiring - I'm sure you're helping others who may be struggling to feel less alone.

I don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but I'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. You're INCREDIBLE. Keep fighting. Keep going. It's going to be okay.

Those moments are going to see you through the storms. Because there will be storms. Maybe you're in the storm right now. You'll get through it.

For anyone reading this, I want to add that it's okay to take things one step at a time. When the storm feels overwhelming, focus on just getting through the next hour, or the next day. Celebrate those tiny victories, because they're what keep us going. And don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it - whether it's a trusted friend, family member, or a professional.

POST BODY: Yes. YOU. The person reading this right now. You're amazing. I'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. Because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. Because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're STILL HERE. I don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but I'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. You're INCREDIBLE. Keep fighting. Keep going. It's going to be okay. I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. You're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. Those moments are going to see you through the storms. Because there will be storms. Maybe you're in the storm right now. You'll get through it. Because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. You're incredible and strong, and I know you can do it. I have faith in you. I'm here for you. 
YOU. ARE. AMAZING.

f1t9o0,Anxiety,"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.",ladythescottishplay,"I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.",916,54,1581354368,"You just said everything I‚Äôm feeling right now.

I hope we both feel better soon.",90,ilikefluffypuppies,"I completely get it - the pressure to ""be strong"" can be overwhelming when all you want to do is break down. It's like you're carrying the weight of everyone's expectations on your shoulders, and it's crushing.

First of all, let me just say that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel weak, to fall apart, and to need time to recharge. It's not a sign of failure; it's a sign that you're human.

I think it's amazing that you have a supportive partner, but I also want to remind you that it's okay to take time for yourself, too. Not just to do chores or make dinner, but to actually take care of your mental health. Maybe that means taking a few hours to curl up in bed and cry (because, honestly, sometimes that's exactly what we need).

As for your desire for a more supportive society, I couldn't agree more. We need to work towards creating a culture that values mental health just as much as physical health. But until then, let's focus on being kind to ourselves and each other. You got this, and you're not alone.","

I love how you put it - ""this is my normal."" That's so important to remember. We all have our own normals, and what works for someone else might not work for us. And that's okay. It's about finding what works for you and being kind to yourself in the process.

Your point about maintenance is also spot on. Whether it's exercise, therapy, or medication, we all need to put in work to maintain our mental health. And that's not a bad thing - it's just life.

Now that you've got your license, don't be too hard on yourself if you're still getting used to driving. It takes time and practice to build confidence, but it sounds like you're already on the right track. Just remember to stay focused, follow the rules, and trust your instincts. You got this!

What's the plan now that you've got your license? Are you looking forward to driving to school, work, or just cruising around with friends? Either way, enjoy this newfound freedom!""","

One thing that's helped me is to practice self-compassion when I'm feeling stuck in a negative mindset.

It's not always easy, but it's helped me to break free from those negative thought patterns.

b2b1t3,Anxiety,Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,TheLittlestDandelion,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure.

As someone who also experiences anxiety triggered by loud sounds, I feel you on the balloon thing - it's like my whole body tenses up just anticipating that sudden noise. I've found that one thing that helps is being prepared and having a plan for when those loud noises happen. For example, if I know a fire alarm is going to be tested, I try to take a few deep breaths beforehand and remind myself that it's just a drill.

Another thing that's helped me is using ear protection in situations where I know loud noises will be present. It's not always possible, but it can be a lifesaver when it is. Lastly, I've found that talking to a therapist has really helped me work through some of the underlying issues that contribute to my noise anxiety. It might be worth exploring that option if you haven't already. You're not alone in this, and there are people who understand what you're going through.","

It sounds like your mind has developed a pattern of hypervigilance, constantly scanning for potential threats or problems. This can be exhausting and debilitating.

One strategy that might help is to practice mindfulness and challenge those negative thoughts. When you catch yourself catastrophizing or jumping to worst-case scenarios, try to reframe those thoughts in a more balanced or realistic way. For example, instead of thinking ""this will never work,"" try reframing it as ""I've handled tough situations before, and I can do it again.""

It's also important to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers. Remind yourself that it's normal to have some uncertainty and that you're doing the best you can. Lastly, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or past.

Keep in mind that it takes time and practice to change these thought patterns, but with therapy and self-reflection, you can develop more constructive ways of thinking.","

POST TITLE: Does anybody else's mind actively just searches for problems to find and then causes anxiety?

POST BODY: I've been suffering from anxiety for a long time and only recently been seeking help through therapy. I've come to this subreddit to learn from other's experience with  their anxiety.

Way my anxiety works my mind actively searches for problems to stress about and causes me anxiety. Like if I solve one problem mind instantly finds another problem to worry about and makes mountains out of mole hills and repeat, I never think anything will go right and always think worst case scenario even if its ridiculous. I'm just looking for some advice to help avoid these thoughts and improve my thinking. I don't know if I used the right flair sorry.

djmzx4,Anxiety,"Has anyone found that their ability to read text, write, and spell drastically goes down when anxious?",[deleted],Just something that has been happening too much lately and was wondering if this could be contributed to anxiety.,889,76,1571402776,"Yes! Physically I get tremors, so I end up typing some wild chaos instead of the simple, human text I meant to get to. I can‚Äôt focus to read, either; I get really jittery and it‚Äôs like the last thing I wanna do is be tied up on reading.",79,wonderlessbread,,0,,"I totally get what you're going through. Anxiety can be a major brain fog inducer, and it's not uncommon for people to experience a decline in cognitive skills like reading, writing, and spelling when they're feeling anxious.

When we're anxious, our brains go into ""fight or flight"" mode, which can impair our ability to focus and process information. It's like our brain's ""executive function"" is hijacked by our anxiety, making it harder to concentrate and think clearly.

One thing that might help is to try to break down your reading and writing tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable, even when you're feeling anxious. Additionally, taking regular breaks to practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation can help calm your mind and reduce brain fog.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's not a reflection of your intelligence or abilities. Anxiety can be a real challenge, but there are ways to manage it and improve your cognitive function.","

85r9nl,Anxiety,does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?,unicornbottle,"One of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. I fear getting scolded more than I fear my future career. Even if I know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, I get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. 

I was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. After that one encounter, I was so scared that I would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice. ",845,120,1521536451,I've always been afraid of getting yelled at. Even if someone just raises their voice just a little bit I get teary eyed. It makes me feel so useless. ,285,HikikomoriOnnanoko,"My father used to smack me on the head. Nobody, in those days, though anything of it. I must have done something to deserve it.

Into my 30's I flinched whenever someone raised there hand to brush their hair, scratch an itchy ear, etc. 

I soon realized that it was a reflexive response to a repeated stimulus. 

I used to wish be would beat me so people would see me as the victim. I still have this desire today. 

We are hard-wired to survive at any cost. We are abused during our most vulnerable early years. We learn to adapt our behavior to stay in the group. No group, no food, shelter, Mazlow's hierarchy of needs stuff.

Think about it. What three-year child old can say ""this is crazy, I don't deserve this and I'm leaving. You adapt to your situation to survive. If surviving means you have to turn that anger inward then that is what will happen. If survival means staying in a crazy home then that is what you will do.

Some escape but most don't. The cycle repeats. ",13,builder17,"""I can totally relate to your fear of being scolded. It sounds like that experience with your coach at 15 left a lasting impact, and it's not uncommon for traumatic events (even if they might not seem 'traumatic' to others) to shape our responses to similar situations in the future.

First, just want to say that your fear is valid, and it's okay to feel that way. It's amazing that you're recognizing how it's affecting your life and wanting to make a change.

One thing that might help is to reframe your thinking around being scolded. Instead of catastrophizing and assuming the worst, try to remind yourself that even if someone does yell or scold, it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's often a reflection of their own stress or frustration.

Also, it might be helpful to have a 'pre-game' routine to calm your nerves before meetings or interactions that might trigger your anxiety. Deep breathing, positive self-talk, or even just a short walk might help you feel more centered.

You're not alone in this, and it's not something you have to face alone. Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend/family member about your fears and see if they can offer any additional support.""","

First, let me just say that you're not alone in this. Many people experience what's called 'meta-anxiety' (anxiety about having anxiety), and it can be really debilitating.

One thing that might help is to try to separate the physical sensations of anxiety from the thoughts that come with it. Instead of getting caught up in the 'I'm wasting my life' narrative, try to focus on the physical sensations themselves. Notice where they are in your body, and try to breathe into them. Sometimes, just acknowledging and accepting the sensations can help reduce their intensity.

It might also be helpful to reframe your thinking around anxiety. Instead of seeing it as a personal failing, try to view it as a signal that your body is sending you - a sign that you need to take care of yourself. Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

POST BODY: I feel this right now. I have to work again tomorrow and I feel like I‚Äôm gonna log on to my laptop and then see a bunch of ‚Äúnegative‚Äù messages from senior workers. 

This job has caused me enough stress that my anxiety has skyrocketed. The amount of anxiety attacks I get, oh boy. I know the solution would be to leave but I can‚Äôt afford that right now. 

But does anyone else always get this gut feeling like oh hey today‚Äôs gonna be a bad day and then it actually does?

I'm so proud of you for pushing through and taking care of yourself, even when it feels like the smallest thing.

It's amazing how we often underestimate the power of tiny wins, but honestly, this is a huge deal. You've broken a cycle that's been holding you back, and that's something to celebrate. Remember that it's okay to take things one small step at a time - you don't have to tackle everything at once.

Your edit really resonated with me, too. It's so important to remind ourselves (and others) that better days will come. It's easy to get caught up in the present moment and feel like things will never get better, but they will. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels like a struggle. You're not alone in this, and it sounds like you're already starting to turn a corner. Keep going, friend!""","

I totally get why that can feel daunting, especially when you're already anxious about being judged. It's awesome that you found a way to make it more comfortable by focusing on your food and texting friends.

Regarding applying for a job, I think you've already shown that you're capable of pushing past your fears. Walking into a store to ask about a job might feel like a bigger hurdle, but it's not that different from what you just did. You can take a few deep breaths, remind yourself that you've got this, and just go for it. 

If it helps, try to reframe your thinking: instead of worrying about what others might think, focus on the fact that you're taking steps towards your goals. You're doing this for yourself, and that's something to be proud of. Keep pushing forward, and I'm sure you'll find that it gets easier with time.""","

rv4ybr,Anxiety,I'd rather die than feel like this,[deleted],"School started today and I woke up with my heart beating like crazy. I could feel and hear the blood in my brain. Then I ate breakfast- threw it all up. On every break I had to go to the toilet (nausea, sorry if that's gross :/). I finished school- went to the shop with my mum. My heart was still beating very heavily and I felt dizzy. Additionally I got lost without a phone. The shop was huge and I was looking on the right and then to the left trying to spot my mom in the huge crowd of people. With every move of my head I felt more and more dizzy. I thought I was gonna either burst out crying or pass out. I didn't luckily. Just imagine, 17 years old man crying because he got lost in the shop- pathetic, but I was in such a bad state this day that it was really hard to keep myself at least a little bit rational. Well, I found her (yay :,)) I got back home but I am in such a bad state that I am not able to eat anything. I've tried but I feel like throwing up and my heart is still so loud. What shall I do?

I had my meds switched and it makes an huge difference. Don‚Äôt feel bad about being upset. You were overwhelmed and it was just too much. I‚Äôm sorry your day was terrible.,97,lmnop94,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds incredibly overwhelming and scary, especially with school just starting. First, please know that you're not alone and what you're experiencing is not pathetic - it's a sign that you're feeling overwhelmed and that's okay.

It's possible that you're experiencing an anxiety attack or a panic episode, which can be really intense. One thing that might help is to talk to a trusted adult (maybe a school counselor or a family member other than your mom, if you're not ready to talk to her yet) about what you're going through. They can offer support and help you figure out what to do next.

In the meantime, try to take some slow, deep breaths and focus on the present moment. Sometimes, our thoughts can get ahead of us and make things feel worse. You might also consider reaching out to a crisis hotline or an online support service - they can offer you immediate support and guidance.

Remember, you're not alone, and you can get through this.","

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine.",892,67,1624131809,"I‚Äòm proud of you &amp; happy for you that you got vaccinated.

I can only imagine how tough it must've been to overcome your anxiety and concerns about the vaccine, especially with your bipolar disorder and medication combination. It's completely understandable that you'd want to be cautious.

I'm glad you were able to push through and get the vaccine, even if it was unintentionally without meds. However, I do want to encourage you to reach out to your doctor's office or the covering psychiatrist to see if there's a way to get your meds adjusted sooner. Going without your usual medication for an extended period can be really tough, especially with a major depression episode.

Remember that it's okay to prioritize your mental health right now, and don't hesitate to seek help if you need it. You're doing great, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging your fears and taking steps to protect yourself from COVID-19. Keep going, and take care of yourself during this time""","

I've been dealing with chronic anxiety for a while now, and it's like my brain is constantly foggy. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's hard to put my thoughts into words without sounding silly or jumbled. It's like I'm watching myself from the outside, and it's a really surreal experience.

First of all, let me just say that you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be incredibly debilitating, and it's not uncommon for it to affect our cognitive abilities and overall sense of well-being. I've had days where I felt like I was losing my grip on reality, and it was terrifying.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on self-care and mindfulness. It sounds clich√©, but taking time to breathe, meditate, and engage in activities that bring me joy has really helped me to ground myself. It's not going to make the anxiety disappear, but it's helped me to manage it better.

Also, just want to say that it's totally normal to have hypochondria-like thoughts when you're dealing with chronic anxiety. It's like your brain is constantly on high alert, looking for potential threats. But it's good that you're aware of it, and you can try to talk yourself down from those thoughts.

Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone.","

It is getting better but it can still be so confusing...",5,LightningBolt_12,"I completely get what you're saying - the uncertainty can be just as debilitating as the anxiety itself. It's like your brain is constantly trying to play detective, and that can be exhausting.

First of all, I want to acknowledge that it's really tough to be dealing with this headache for two weeks, and I hope you get some answers soon. In the meantime, I want to offer a gentle suggestion: try not to get too caught up in the ""anxiety or not?"" loop. Instead, focus on what you can control, like taking care of yourself and managing your anxiety symptoms.

One thing that might help is to keep a journal or log to track when your headaches happen, what you're doing at the time, and how you're feeling. This can help you identify any patterns or triggers. It's not a substitute for medical advice, but it can give you some insight into what might be going on.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Sending you lots of support and hoping you find some relief soon.","

It's completely understandable that you'd still have setbacks, especially when facing new or unexplored topics.

I love your message of hope and encouragement to others who are struggling. It's so important to acknowledge that progress might not always feel linear, but it's often happening in small, incremental steps. Remember that it's okay to not have all the answers or solutions yet - the fact that you're actively working on yourself and seeking help is a testament to your strength and resilience.

Don't be too hard on yourself about having an attack tonight - instead, try to focus on what you've learned from it and how you can apply that to future situations. You've got this, and you're not alone in this journey. Keep pushing forward, and remember to be kind to yourself along the way.""","

rjoobk,Anxiety,I‚Äôm graduating from my masters program and no one cares,ladymemedaddy,"So I‚Äôm graduating with my Masters at the end of December, but I finish classes in a few days. I also graduated college class of 2020 and spent my graduating sitting on my couch crying because I was so sad. I decided to try to let it go, since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn‚Äôt. Now, it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I‚Äôm happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn‚Äôt been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can‚Äôt even do that, and I don‚Äôt want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven‚Äôt been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don‚Äôt know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there‚Äôs nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it‚Äôs causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Edit: I am blown away by the kindness of strangers who don‚Äôt even know me, but took the time to write something nice. Sending all of you virtual hugs‚ù§Ô∏è I am so appreciative of all your kind words

Edit 2: WOW! Thank you all so much for your comments! I spent the past 2 days crying with horrible anxiety, but waking up seeing all your comments and kindness really turned my day around.

First of all, huge congratulations on your Master's degree - that's a massive accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself! It's not about comparing your achievements to your sister's, but about acknowledging your own hard work and dedication.

I think it's great that you're trying to focus on your own celebration with friends on New Year's, even if it's not going as planned. Maybe you could still celebrate in a smaller way, or even plan a belated celebration when COVID cases calm down. Your achievement is worth recognizing, and I'm sure your friends will want to celebrate with you when the time is right.

Remember, your worth and achievements aren't defined by how others respond to them. You've earned this degree, and you deserve to celebrate and be proud of yourself, regardless of what anyone else is doing.""","

I can only imagine how terrifying it must have been to be stuck on a train, but it's amazing that you found a way to cope and come out on top.

It's incredible that you recognized the emergency button as a potential escape, but instead chose to focus on your breathing and relaxation techniques. That takes a lot of self-awareness and courage. It's clear that you're already making progress in managing your anxiety, and it's awesome that you're seeking professional help to continue working on it.

Remember that overcoming anxiety is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

xwjgez,Anxiety,"Anyone get shortness of breath or ""oxygen hunger"" from anxiety?",Puzzled_Barnacle_785,"I started getting shortness of breath about a year ago. I think it got real bad last fall, came back a little in the spring, and now it is back again. My partner and I thought it was allergies but allergy medicine isn't working. I like to play pickup soccer and basketball and I'm still able to run fine. I've had x-rays and heart tests that are all normal. For these reasons, I've had two doctors tell me it's anxiety. I have a history with anxiety but this is generally the least anxious and most happy I've been since adulthood. So I'm wondering if I've just normalized it or maybe don't know how to to identify all forms of anxiety. Is there anyone else that's had shortness of breath from anxiety? If so, did any medications help?",781,173,1664997168,"All the time. I forget to breathe. That‚Äôs why. My therapist always notices when I need to take a breath, too. Lol make sure you take deep breathes when you have anxiety or feel nervous.

Do you notice it gets worse when you have other sources of stress in your life?",30,zoethequagga,"I totally get what you're going through. Anxiety can manifest in so many ways, and it's not uncommon for it to affect our breathing. I've experienced similar symptoms, and it can be really frustrating when you feel like you've got everything under control, but your body is telling a different story.

First of all, kudos to you for recognizing that it might be anxiety-related and seeking help. That takes a lot of courage. Considering you've had normal test results, it's likely that anxiety is playing a role here. One thing you might want to try is keeping a journal or log of when these episodes happen, and what you were doing or feeling beforehand. This might help you identify any patterns or triggers.

In terms of medications, I've heard that beta blockers can be really helpful for anxiety-related physical symptoms like shortness of breath. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor before trying anything new. Remember that you're not alone in this, and there are people who understand what you're going through. Hang in there, and don't be afraid to reach out for support.","

We've all been there - stress and anxiety boil over, and we lash out at someone who doesn't deserve it. The immediate guilt and regret that follows can be suffocating.

Firstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge that you're human. We all make mistakes, and it's how we learn and grow from them that matters. Since you couldn't apologize to the stranger, try practicing self-compassion instead. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and it's okay to have a bad day.

As for the fear of something bad happening to you, try to reframe it as a lesson learned. Instead of dwelling on the what-ifs, focus on how you can improve your response to stress in the future. Maybe take some time to reflect on what triggered your reaction and work on healthier coping mechanisms.

Remember, karma isn't about punishing you for one mistake; it's about the energy you put out into the world consistently. You can't change the past, but you can use this experience to become a kinder, more patient person moving forward.","

When people respond with dismissiveness, it might be because they don't understand anxiety or haven't experienced it themselves. It's not your job to educate them, but if you feel like you need to, you can simply say, ""I'm not making this up, and it would really help me if you could take my feelings seriously.""

Remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation for how you're feeling. Your anxiety is valid, and you deserve support and understanding. Keep talking about it, and don't let anyone make you feel like you're not enough. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

ou3vxb,Anxiety,He overdosed in front of me.,ScientistSuper7280,"I‚Äôm 24f on my way home from work one day I realized I had forgotten something. I decided to turn around but instead of taking my normal way I decided to take a shortcut that I have never taken before. I was flagged down by a man who said there was a guy ‚Äúsleeping or drunk‚Äù on the side of the road and asked me to see if I could wake him up. (The man that flagged me down couldn‚Äôt speak good English and it was a busy road). I got out of my car and went over to the man. He was ‚Äúsnoring‚Äù but I knew that he wasn‚Äôt drunk he was actually overdosing. I asked how long he had been there and the man said over 30 minutes. I grabbed the phone and called the police. I told them someone was on the side of the road with visible powder up their nose and puke all over them. The operator instructed me to try to wake him up. I found a landscaper and ripped the gloves off of him and proceeded to try and wake the man up. The snoring was getting louder, I was told to start CPR. The guy was stuck behind a tree and I couldn‚Äôt move him I‚Äôm very weak  and he was at least 200 pounds. I tried my best to drag him out. He stopped breathing and I realized he was choking on his own vomit. I pushed him onto his side and he began breathing again. The police showed up and he woke up after some help from them. 

My father is a recovering drug addict and this was one of the worst moments of my life. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I have no medical training, I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt believe no one helped me, people were just watching. They left him there for over 30 minutes. It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Has anyone ever dealt with helping a stranger like this? I can‚Äôt stop replaying the images in my head. I get the worst anxiety about this.

The fact that you were not prepared but stepped up to the challenge anyway makes it that much more incredible. People stand and watch because they don‚Äôt have the guts to get involved. It‚Äôs unfortunately not surprising; the bystander effect is recognized across cultures. Whether out of fear or indifference, few people rise up to the challenge of helping a stranger. It might have been scary, but at least you did everything right.

It's completely understandable that it's left a lasting impact on you, especially given your personal connection to addiction through your father. What you did, though, is nothing short of heroic.

It's not stupid at all to consider reaching out to a therapist. In fact, it's a brave and proactive step in taking care of your own mental health. You've been through a traumatic experience, and it's normal to feel anxious and replay the images in your head. A therapist can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies to deal with the aftermath.

Remember that you did the best you could in that moment, and it was enough. You shouldn't be too hard on yourself for not having medical training ‚Äì you acted on instinct and followed the guidance of the operator.

He stopped breathing and I realized he was choking on his own vomit. I pushed him onto his side and he began breathing again. The police showed up and he woke up after some help from them. 

My father is a recovering drug addict and this was one of the worst moments of my life. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I have no medical training, I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt believe no one helped me, people were just watching. They left him there for over 30 minutes. It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Has anyone ever dealt with helping a stranger like this? I can‚Äôt stop replaying the images in my head. I get the worst anxiety about this. Is it stupid if I reach out to a therapist?

g14yme,Anxiety,I‚Äôm crying because the pharmacist treated me like a drug addict,knowledgesimm,"(UPDATED!)Today l went to the pharmacist to get my prescription of 7 pieces 0.5 mg xanax that my psychiatrist gave me for my generalized anxiety disorder carrying my passport like they asked of me and because in my country people my age don‚Äôt have any other id (15) and she refused to give it to me saying she needed an id card and people go around asking for this stuff so l told her l don‚Äôt have an ld card and to give me my other prescription of Cipralex and she refused and left the window. It scarred me and l‚Äôm scared to ask for my prescription of xanax in any other pharmacy.

Update: l‚Äôm so happy right now! I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem. This was my first time ever picking xanax and it was so scary but l got thorough it with your kind words and advice! Thank you all so much everyone who upvoted and replied :).",786,163,1586868703,"Im sorry this has happened to you, it sounds like an awful experience to have to endure! That pharmacists reaction seems inappropriate to me. You're not a drug addict. A passport counts as id as well though because it has your birthdate on it, right?? i would either phone your doctor/psychiatrist and explain what happened so they can talk to the pharmacist or go to another pharmacy. the pharmacist you spoke to definitely did not respond to you in a way that they should have, in fact im shocked that they just left the window that seems completely wrong and inappropriate to not even explain why they thought that they couldn't serve you. you had a passport and your prescription so i wouldn't worry about doing anything wrong - you haven't, but i know how these types of experiences can deter you from wanting to do a similar thing again. i do think its worth trying to go to another pharmacist, or even asking (if you are comfortable doing so of course) an older family member to pick it up for you if thats allowed in your country.

if you want to talk to someone to talk your mind of things then my pms are open for anything.",281,azacitidine,"As someone who works in a pharmacy, I'm confused as to how a 7 count script of xanax is a red flag. Passports tend to be a form of valid ID at pretty much every place I've been to as well. Was this a chain or an independent pharmacy? Though to be fair, no matter where it was, that was not how most people would have handled the situation. It really does sound a bit suspect that the interaction went like that. If it was a chain, ask to speak to a manager about your interaction, because that is not customer service. Even if they needed another form of ID, which I don't know why they would since a passport can validate the info needed, they could have been much more polite about it.",41,Sharinganedo,"I'm so glad to see the update and that you were able to get your prescription filled at another pharmacy. I can only imagine how frustrating and scary the initial experience must have been, especially when you're already dealing with anxiety.

First of all, let me just say that it's completely unacceptable for a pharmacist to make you feel like a drug addict. You have a legitimate prescription from a psychiatrist, and you deserve to be treated with respect and understanding.

It's great that you had the courage to go back to the pharmacy with your sister and advocate for yourself. And it's even more wonderful that the second pharmacist was polite and helpful.

Remember, it's okay to advocate for yourself, especially when it comes to your health. Don't be afraid to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you feel uncomfortable or mistreated. You got this, and you're not alone.","

iqahuc,Anxiety,Anyone else have their health issues brushed off by medical professionals due to an anxiety diagnosis?,Optimistic_Mute,"
Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance‚Äôs nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow I‚Äôm seeing that you‚Äôre a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don‚Äôt fly with me as a nurse.‚Äù This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real. After talking more he reluctantly suggested I go to the ED. I didn‚Äôt go immediately that night because the comments made made me feel like I was overreacting and that my need for care wasn‚Äôt important or a waste of time. I did go to the ED that afternoon around 3pm because my rash, itching, and fatigue were only getting worse. I was diagnosed with mites by the ER doctor and prescribed an anti-parasitic which has so far provided some relief. 

I‚Äôve filed a grievance with my insurance because I feel like my dignity as a patient was violated and prevented me from seeking out care. At first I thought maybe this isn‚Äôt a big deal but after consulting with friends they said that this was unacceptable and that I should file a report. I‚Äôm kind of used to going to the doctor and having them brush things off as anxiety and it just seems like a vicious cycle cuz I never do anything about it because of my anxiety and not wanting to make it a big deal.",843,105,1599766465,[deleted],84,[deleted],"I completely understand! In middle school I started passing out every day, and as a result I would get nervous that I would pass out, have a panic attack, and then pass out again. Turns out I have chronic EDS and POTS, which comes with dysautonomia and sensitivities to temperature. Took me 4 years to get an official diagnosis!",30,kr3pie,"""I'm so sorry you had to go through that experience. It's completely unacceptable for a medical professional to dismiss your physical symptoms because of an anxiety diagnosis. I can only imagine how frustrating and invalidating that must have felt, especially when you were already struggling with unbearable itching and fatigue.

First of all, please know that you did the right thing by filing a grievance with your insurance. Your dignity as a patient should never be compromised, and it's essential to hold medical professionals accountable for their actions.

It's also great that you have supportive friends who encouraged you to take action. Remember that your physical health is just as important as your mental health, and you deserve to be heard and taken seriously.

Don't let this experience discourage you from seeking medical care in the future. Keep advocating for yourself, and don't hesitate to ask for a second opinion if you feel like your concerns are being dismissed. You got this, and you deserve better.""","

It's a great reminder that even small victories can be a big deal when you're struggling with anxiety.

I've found that setting tiny, achievable goals for myself on tough days can help build momentum and make it feel more manageable. It might sound silly, but it's amazing how accomplishing something small can give you the confidence to take on the next thing.

9ecvfp,Anxiety,"Wake up feeling fine until I ""remember"" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?",spaceraycharles,"Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ ",872,75,1536498905,"Yea man, sometimes I'm walking feeling fine and I remember that I have anxiety and unpleasant body sensations from it and boom, I get them lol.",163,nikolaretard,"Yea man, sometimes I'm walking feeling fine and I remember that I have anxiety and unpleasant body sensations from it and boom, I get them lol.",163,nikolaretard,"I totally get what you're talking about. It's like your brain has become so accustomed to anxiety that it's on autopilot, waiting for the cue to kick in. I've experienced something similar, and it's really frustrating.

One thing that might help is to practice ""noticing"" your anxiety without engaging with it. When you feel that pit in your stomach, try to acknowledge it without judgment, and then let it go. It's almost like you're observing a thought, but not becoming it. It takes practice, but it can help break the cycle.

It's also possible that your brain is still processing the stress from the situation with your friend, even if it's resolved. Sometimes our brains take a little longer to catch up. Consider trying some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help calm your nervous system.

Remember, you're not alone in this. It's okay to feel anxious, and it's okay to take time to figure out how to manage it. Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.","

It's like there's this unspoken pressure to match the pace of the people around us, even if it doesn't feel natural.

It's amazing that you're taking the time to tune in to your body and become more mindful of your habits. Slowing down your speech can be a game-changer - not just for reducing stumbles and stutters, but also for feeling more confident and in control.

As for the physical aspect, I love your point about being still and calm. It's so easy to get caught up in fidgety habits without even realizing it. A great exercise to try is simply paying attention to your breath and letting go of any tension in your body. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, feel any stress or restlessness melt away. Remember, it's okay to take your time and move at your own pace - you don't have to match anyone else's speed. Keep being more mindful and compassionate with yourself!","

It might also be helpful to reframe the concept of ""trust your gut"" to be more about trusting yourself and your abilities, rather than relying solely on intuition. You know what you want and what's best for you, even if your anxiety tries to convince you otherwise.

I can only imagine how challenging the past week must have been for you.

It's great that you're focusing on the small wins, though. Sometimes, it's those tiny accomplishments that get us through the tough times. 54 days might seem like a long time until your husband comes home, but breaking it down into smaller milestones (like this eating milestone) can make it feel more manageable.

Remember to be kind to yourself and prioritize your health during this time. It's okay to take things one day at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Hang in there, and before you know it, 54 days will be behind you.""","

ircthi,Anxiety,Is it just me or this pandemic thing triggered anxiety attacks on a lot of people?,Novatonavila,"Since this pandemic started, I started having anxiety attacks.

I only really had social anxiety and maybe a few anxiety attacks, but after the pandemic I started having panic attacks, health anxiety and an annoyingly persistent shortness of breath. Still not fully convinced it's not asthma or something else.",2,NoLightOnlyDarkness,"""I totally get what you're going through. I've seen and experienced it myself - the pandemic has been a perfect storm for anxiety. The uncertainty, isolation, and constant stream of bad news can be overwhelming. It's no wonder that people who never had anxiety before are now experiencing it.

First of all, kudos to you for recognizing what's happening and seeking support. That's a huge step. When I started having anxiety attacks, I found it helpful to focus on my breathing and try to ground myself in the present moment. There are some great apps and YouTube videos that can guide you through exercises to calm your mind and body.

Also, remember that you're not alone in this. It's okay to feel scared, frustrated, or overwhelmed. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist if you need to talk. And please, take care of yourself - get enough sleep, move your body, and do things that bring you joy. You got this, and this too shall pass.""","

They'll likely be just as eager to get to know you as you are to learn from them.

You've already taken a huge step by landing the job, so trust that you've got this.

I've been there too - constantly second-guessing myself, worried that I'm coming across as ""that person"" who's always talking about their anxiety.

Here's the thing: you're not alone in this, and you're not ""that person."" You're just someone who's struggling, and that's okay. It's okay to talk about your anxiety, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being.

Try to reframe your thinking - instead of worrying about how others perceive you, focus on why you're sharing your struggles in the first place. Is it to connect with others who might be going through the same thing? To raise awareness about mental health? To remind yourself that you're not alone? Whatever the reason, remember that your voice matters, and your story is worth sharing.

Don't delete this post - you're helping more people than you think, just by being honest and vulnerable. Keep talking, and know that you're not alone in this. üíï","

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who‚Äôs only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It‚Äôs so hard to put into words how I‚Äôm feeling. It‚Äôs like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can‚Äôt. That person is forever gone.

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There‚Äôs no trigger. There‚Äôs not single thing that starts it, because it‚Äôs a constant. It doesn‚Äôt ever stop.

I can totally relate to feeling like you've lost touch with who you used to be. It's like your identity has been hijacked by anxiety and depression.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. It's common for people to experience an identity shift when dealing with mental health struggles. It's like you're navigating a new landscape, and it's hard to find your bearings.

One thing that might help is to focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Mindfulness practices can be really helpful in this regard. It's also important to remember that you are not your mental health. You are still the same person with the same values, interests, and passions ‚Äì they might just be buried under the surface right now.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny step each day.","

8r7ozl,Anxiety,Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,ZexMurphy,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again.",835,106,1529031234,"It‚Äôs not too late for you to turn that around for yourself.

And the years and the opportunities just went by. 

I hope you find a way to break through your cocoon. ",10,hyy65,"OP, I just wanted to say thank you for sharing your story. It takes a lot of courage to be this vulnerable, especially when it's about struggles that can be so debilitating. I can only imagine how tough it must be for you to be in this place right now.

Your message is incredibly powerful, and I hope it resonates with everyone who reads it. Avoidance might seem like an easy way out, but it's exactly that - a temporary escape that can lead to long-term consequences. I'm glad you're taking your own advice now and not losing hope.

For anyone struggling with anxiety, I want to echo OP's message: don't be afraid to seek help. Talk to someone you trust, whether it's a friend, family member, or mental health professional. There are also some amazing resources online, like crisis hotlines and support groups.

Remember, you're not alone in this fight. There are people who care about you and want to help. Keep pushing forward, even when it feels like the smallest step. You are stronger than you think, and things can get better.","

I've always been more of a one-on-one person myself, and group conversations can be super overwhelming. I think part of it is the pressure to keep up with multiple conversations at once and the fear of saying something ""wrong"" or awkward.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on smaller, more intimate groups (like 3-4 people) where I can actually engage with everyone without feeling too anxious. It's also helped me to take a step back and remind myself that it's okay to not contribute to every single conversation. Sometimes just listening and observing can be a great way to participate without feeling overwhelmed.

Lastly, try not to be too hard on yourself if you do feel anxious in group conversations. It's totally normal, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. You're not alone in feeling this way, and there are plenty of people who feel the same.","

My anxiety always gets the better of me :(,863,74,1630988602,[deleted],334,[deleted],,0,,"I totally get it. Having a medical appointment can be super overwhelming, especially when you're someone with anxiety. It's like your brain is constantly reminding you of the appointment, making it hard to focus on anything else.

One thing that might help is to try and break down your day into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking ""I have a whole day of work to do,"" try focusing on one task at a time. Set a timer for 25 minutes, work on that task, and then take a 5-minute break. This can help make your workload feel less daunting and give you a sense of accomplishment.

Also, consider doing some relaxation techniques before your appointment, like deep breathing or a short meditation. This might help calm your nerves and make the experience feel less overwhelming. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it's not uncommon for medical appointments to throw off your day. You're not alone in this, and you got this!","

One thing that helped me (and might help you) is breaking down these tasks into tiny, manageable bits. Instead of worrying about eating a whole meal, try focusing on taking one sip of water at a time. It sounds silly, but it can help your brain feel less overwhelmed.

I completely get why something that might seem simple to others can be a massive accomplishment for you. It's amazing that you acknowledged your struggles and made the effort to challenge yourself.

Firstly, please don't be embarrassed about sharing this - it's actually really inspiring. Your honesty might help someone else feel more comfortable opening up about their own struggles.

As for advice, I'd say keep building on this momentum. Now that you've broken the ice, try to schedule small, manageable outings regularly. It could be as simple as going for a short walk or grabbing a coffee. Celebrate each tiny win, and don't be too hard on yourself if you have setbacks.

Remember, it's not about being 'normal' or comparing yourself to others - it's about your personal growth and progress. You got this, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself.""","

emckin,Anxiety,DAE experience 'burnout' for several days after one very rough day?,ShasLa40,"After a day where I'm an absolute mess and have to push through some very tricky anxiety I'll end up feeling burned out for about 2 weeks afterwards. I struggle to eat and I wake up exhausted every morning and feel dizzy and in general have a much higher baseline of anxiety that usual.

Anyone else have this? Could it be something like Adrenal Fatigue?",861,75,1578589702,"Ugh, yes. I call it an anxiety hangover because it honestly feels so much like a real hangover sometimes. Low energy, often physically ill, antisocial, and the elevated baseline of anxiety. It's miserable.",162,theonlycanvas,"i relate to this big time. it‚Äôs like it takes ages to recover and by the time i have, i‚Äôm just waiting for the next anxiety moment üòÖ",84,prettyvxcant,"I totally get what you're describing, and I'm glad you're sharing this. I've been there too, where one tough day can send me into a tailspin of exhaustion and anxiety that lasts for weeks. It's like my body's stress response gets stuck on overdrive.

While I'm no expert, I'm not convinced that Adrenal Fatigue is a formally recognized medical condition (some docs consider it a myth). However, I do think that chronic stress can totally mess with your cortisol levels, energy, and mood.

One thing that helps me is prioritizing self-care after a rough day. For me, that means taking a digital detox, getting plenty of sleep, and doing some gentle exercise (like yoga or a walk). I also try to eat nourishing foods, even if I don't feel like it ‚Äì sometimes, a warm bowl of soup or a smoothie can be a lifesaver.

Remember that you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take your time to recover. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out for support if you need it. Hang in there, friend.","

It fucking sucks, can't sleep and you can't eat and you feel like your mind and body is against you. Shit lasted for three days.

It can be incredibly overwhelming and isolating to feel like you're stuck in a never-ending cycle of anxiety. I've been in similar situations before, and it's like your mind is racing with worst-case scenarios, making it hard to breathe, even when your body isn't showing physical symptoms.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone, and this too shall pass. It might not feel like it right now, but these periods do have an end. In the meantime, try to focus on small, manageable moments. Break your day into tiny tasks, like taking a shower or going for a short walk. Sometimes, getting out of your head and into your body can help calm the anxiety.

Also, consider reaching out to a crisis helpline or a therapist for support. They can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies. Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, even when it feels like the smallest step ‚Äì you're stronger than you think.","

First of all, let's acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way. It's actually pretty common, especially if you're someone who likes to have a bit of control over your schedule (like staying home on Sundays).

One thing that helped me is to try to find something small to look forward to on Sundays. It could be as simple as trying a new recipe, watching a movie, or going for a short walk. Having something to anticipate can make the day feel more enjoyable.

Another thing you could try is to set some gentle boundaries for yourself on Sundays. Like, maybe you don't check work emails or think about work tasks until a certain time of day. Give yourself permission to truly unplug and relax. You got this!","

I've been there too - the constant anxiety and the unconscious habit of grinding my teeth or clenching my jaw. It's like my body's way of trying to release all the pent-up tension.

Firstly, it's great that you're acknowledging this habit and seeking help. Have you talked to your doctor or a dentist about this? They might be able to help you figure out if it's related to your antidepressants or not. In the meantime, here are a few things that have helped me: taking deep breaths and trying to relax my jaw when I feel the anxiety kicking in, doing some light jaw stretches throughout the day, and wearing a mouthguard at night to protect my teeth.

It's also worth exploring some relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation. These can help you manage your anxiety and reduce the physical symptoms.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to help. Keep seeking support and take care of yourself.","

opsui7,Anxiety,My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions!,chrwiakgjw462q1,"I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

Your message of hope and encouragement is exactly what this sub needs. It's a reminder that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness, and that there's always a way forward. Keep spreading the positivity and celebrating your successes - you deserve it.

Remember to be kind to yourself and keep practicing those techniques, even when the storm seems to have passed. And don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need to talk or seek guidance again. You've got this, and you're not alone.""","

Rather than comparing yourself to others, try to focus on your own progress, no matter how small it may seem. Celebrate the tiny victories, like having a conversation without your anxiety spiraling out of control. And remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace.

It might be helpful to try some anxiety-reducing techniques, like mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling. These can help calm your mind and body. But most importantly, be kind to yourself.

It's like the emotions just build up and the only way to release them is to let it all out in a string of expletives. 

Glad to hear that doing some physical work helped you pass that intense phase. It's not uncommon for our brains to get overwhelmed and our bodies to respond by releasing all that pent-up energy. 

In the future, if you feel another episode coming on, you might want to try doing something physical ASAP. Sometimes, getting our hearts pumping and blood flowing can help calm our minds. If you're feeling exhausted afterwards, make sure to take some time to rest and recharge. Your body (and mind) will thank you.

Remember, it's okay to have those moments where we just lose it. We're human, after all. If you ever need to vent or just want someone to talk to, this community is here for you. Take care of yourself, friend.","

They may be able to offer some guidance or connect you with someone who can help.

Remember, you don't have to give up on seeking help just because of one bad experience. You deserve better, and there are people out there who care and want to support you. Keep going, and don't lose hope.","

POST TITLE: After years of suffering, i finally worked up the courage to call my GP. He hung up.

POST BODY: It wasn‚Äôt even a long conversation, literally less than a minute. He called, asked if it was me, i confirmed, he asked what the issue was and not long after i started explaining that iv been suffering pretty bad panic attacks and ext, he just huffed and put the phone down. Never called back or anything. So thats basically shot down any chances of me calling my GP again. What do i do now? Its not like i can just get another doctor, and besides I‚Äôm not sure i even want to. My trust was thin to begin with but now its in tatters.

Edit: GP stands for general practitioner. Sort of like the doctor you go to for your general health, normally refer you to people more specialised in what you need.

xu414y,Anxiety,I HATE and DESPISE Sunday evenings!,RexSecundus,"Of all the time in any week, I hate the Sunday evenings the most! Sunday evenings give me anxiety for the week ahead, disappointment in ending the weekend, and in general makes me irritated and sad!

I‚Äôll preemptively miss my kid, who will be in daycare the following day. It sucks.

A few weeks ago the feeling was at its worst, and my wife nearly forced me outside to take a walk. I dunno why, but it ended up being exactly what I needed. I listened to some calming music and just took it all in. So now this afternoon walk is what I do when I feel shitty on a Sunday. Maybe try finding something that you only do on Sunday evenings.

It's like the weekend is this protective bubble that shields us from reality, and when it pops, all the stress and anxiety come flooding back. I've been there too, lying awake on Sunday nights, dreading the week ahead.

One thing that's helped me is to try and focus on the things I'm looking forward to in the week, rather than just the stuff I'm dreading. It sounds cheesy, but it really can help shift your perspective. Also, establishing a relaxing Sunday evening routine can be a game-changer. Whether it's reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches, find something that helps you unwind and sets a positive tone for the night.

Remember, you're not alone in this feeling. So many people struggle with Sunday evening anxiety. You've made it through tough weeks before, and you can do it again. Take a deep breath, be kind to yourself, and try to find some calm in the chaos.","

It can be really tough to feel like we deserve love and care from others when we're not giving it to ourselves first. It's almost like we're waiting for external validation to prove our worth, but that's a never-ending cycle.

The truth is, you do deserve to feel loved and heard - not just from others, but from yourself too. It's amazing that you're recognizing the importance of self-love and care. That's the first step to making a change.

Remember, self-care isn't selfish - it's necessary. Take small steps towards showing yourself kindness and compassion each day. Whether it's taking a few deep breaths, writing in a journal, or simply being present in nature, make time for yourself.

You are worthy of love and care, regardless of what others think or do. Keep working on building that self-love, and I promise you'll start to notice a shift in how you feel about yourself. Keep going, you're on the right path.","

kgkjs8,Anxiety,Does anybody have a high amount of social anxiety but no fear of public speaking or making presentation?,discocrisco,"For me, I have a huge amount of social anxiety but I have zero anxiety with making presentations or public speaking.  

Being in business meeting is easy for me.  Or speaking at AA meeting.  It is almost second nature.

I wonder if anybody else has the same issue and specifically, struggle with one on one communication.  Dating is near impossible for me.",815,112,1608426824,"I used to be in theatre. I‚Äôve literally performed in front of hundreds of people with little to no issue, I would be able to look directly into the audience, I could sing despite being self conscious of my voice...

But going to a social gathering? I want to throw up. Any situation that involves possible one-on-one conversation makes me want to throw up, shake, and I end up either talking about any random thing or I don‚Äôt talk at all. I have to know everything about the situation in order to alleviate the anxiety just a little bit. 

I think the difference is maybe just knowing what to expect and having a general outline of what you need to be talking about. At AA, you talk about AA stuff. At a business meeting, you talk about business stuff. Going on a date... what do you talk about? The food? The weather? What questions will be brought up? What questions should I ask? There‚Äôs a million possibilities, but presentations only have a few outcomes.",169,individual-person,,0,,"I totally get what you're saying, and I'm glad you shared this. It's interesting that you bring up the distinction between public speaking and one-on-one interactions. For some people, the structure and preparation that comes with public speaking can actually be comforting, whereas the unpredictability of one-on-one conversations can be overwhelming.

I've heard of this phenomenon before, and it's more common than you might think. It's like your brain is able to 'perform' in a public setting, but struggles with the intimacy and vulnerability of a personal conversation.

As for dating, I can imagine how tough that must be for you. One thing that might help is to try to find ways to build connections with people in low-stakes settings, like group activities or hobbies. This can help you build confidence in a more gradual way. Also, don't be too hard on yourself if it takes time to find someone who understands and appreciates you for who you are.

You're not alone in this, and there are people who understand what you're going through. Keep being open and honest about your struggles, and I'm sure you'll find support and connection along the way.","

One thing that might help is trying to find some gentle ways to take care of yourself, rather than relying on sugar and caffeine to get through the day. Maybe try taking short walks, doing some light stretching, or practicing some deep breathing exercises. These things might not sound like much, but they can really help to calm your mind and body.

It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of the underlying issues that are contributing to your anxiety and depression. They can also help you develop some coping strategies that are tailored to your specific needs.

I've had my fair share of rewatching old favorites like Friends and Parks and Rec to calm my anxiety. I think it's because, just like you said, the familiarity of these shows can be super comforting. It's almost like revisiting old friends who always make you laugh and feel good.

From a psychological perspective, this behavior is actually pretty common. It's called ""emotional regulation,"" where we use familiar stimuli to calm ourselves down and manage our emotions. In this case, your brain is associating those shows with feelings of comfort and relaxation, which is why you keep coming back to them.

It's great that you're recognizing this pattern in yourself, and it's not necessarily a bad thing! However, if you feel like it's interfering with other aspects of your life or preventing you from tackling your anxiety head-on, it might be worth exploring some other coping strategies as well. But hey, if rewatching Brooklyn Nine-Nine is what gets you through the tough times, I say go for it!","

As someone who's experienced anxiety in social situations, I can understand how wearing a mask might provide a sense of comfort and anonymity. It's almost like having a physical barrier that shields you from the outside world, allowing you to feel more at ease.

I think this phenomenon might be related to the concept of 'social hiding,' where people use masks or other forms of concealment to cope with social anxiety. It's not a bad thing, by the way - if wearing a mask helps you feel more confident and focused at work, that's a win.

Just remember that your anxiety is valid, and it's okay to take steps to manage it. If wearing a mask helps you feel more comfortable, that's perfectly fine. And hey, it's not like you're hiding from the world - you're still doing your job and interacting with people, just with a little extra protection.

I've been in your shoes before, and it's a really tough place to be. Those intrusive thoughts can be overwhelming and take over your entire day. I want you to know that you're not alone in this.

Firstly, it's great that you're acknowledging these thoughts and feelings - that's a huge step. Now, here's what might help: when you start to feel those thoughts creeping in, try to acknowledge them, but then gently let them go. Remind yourself that they're just thoughts, and they don't define your reality. Also, when it comes to breathing, try some deep, slow breaths - inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. This can help calm your nervous system.

Lastly, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about these feelings. They can help you work through them and provide you with some coping strategies. Remember, you're not alone, and there's help available. Keep pushing forward, and know that things can get better.","

I've been there too, and it's like my brain is trying to protect me from potential failure by overestimating the difficulty level.

Your ""unwritten rule"" concept is actually a pretty common thought pattern, especially for people with anxiety. It's like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, expecting that good things can't last. But here's the thing: that's not a universal truth - it's just our brains trying to make sense of the world.

As for physical vs mental anxiety, I think it's a tie for me. Both can be debilitating in their own ways. But I've found that when I focus on the physical sensations (like deep breathing, exercise, or progressive muscle relaxation), it helps calm my mind too.

You're not alone in this, and it's awesome that you're acknowledging these patterns and seeking support. Keep talking about it, and remember that you're capable of handling those responsibilities - even if your brain is trying to tell you otherwise.","

m9imxi,Anxiety,Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism?,[deleted],"Like, to a crippling level. I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again.

This anxiety around feedback is way more common than you think, especially among creatives. I've been there too - it's like, on one hand, you want to grow and improve, but on the other, you're terrified of being torn apart. It's like your self-worth is tied to your work, and any criticism feels like a personal attack.

First of all, kudos to you for recognizing this pattern and wanting to break it. That's already a huge step. One thing that might help is to reframe how you think about feedback. Instead of seeing it as a reflection of your worth, try to view it as a tool to help you grow. Remember that criticism isn't about you as a person, it's about the work itself.

Also, consider finding a supportive community or writing group where you can share your work and get feedback in a safe and constructive environment. It's okay to start small and work your way up. And hey, therapy is always a great idea, but you can start by taking small steps towards confronting your fears. You got this!","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism?

POST BODY: Like, to a crippling level. I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao

DO YOU GET A OVERWHELMING SENSATION ALL OVER YOUR BODY AND FEEL REALLY SCARED???,3,JackW357,"I totally get it - night anxiety can be a real nightmare. It sounds like you're experiencing a pretty classic case of ""catastrophizing,"" where your brain starts spinning all these worst-case scenarios as soon as you're alone with your thoughts at night.

One thing that might help is to try and challenge those thoughts when they come up. When your brain starts telling you that a slight headache means you're having a stroke, try to reframe it in a more realistic way - ""I've had headaches like this before and they've always turned out to be nothing serious."" It's also a good idea to try and establish a consistent bedtime routine that helps signal to your brain that it's time to wind down.

It might also be worth considering some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help calm your mind and body before bed. Remember that you're not alone in this - lots of people struggle with night anxiety, and it's not a reflection of your ability to cope with stress during the day. You got this, and there are things you can do to take control of those nighttime fears.","

axowoi,Anxiety,Im tired of people saying there has to be a reason why I'm anxious.,pizzaslut1121,"Can I not wake up anxious or it suddenly come on? People act like ""oh you're fine"" if you have no specific reason for the anxiety. I have generalized anxiety disorder and binge eating disorder. I can't help it sometimes and when I talk to someone about it, they brush it off like it's not a big deal because I can't figure out why I'm anxious. 

I woke up wanting to eat my whole fridge today. Is there really a giant reason? No. People say ""just eat then"". They don't understand that if I do right now, idk if I can stop myself. You know? It goes with OCD too. You can't stop thinking about it until you act on the obsession.

Sorry for that rant. If anyone would like to talk about it, I'd be happy to possibly make some new friends!",829,92,1551813064,"Yes, there's a reason you're anxious. You have generalized anxiety disorder. 

*Gentle hugs*",273,TheDrachen42,"Sorry you are going through this. Please know that their judgment is a mirror of how they deal with their own emotions. A lot of times they do not give themselves permission to feel a certain way if they do not find a reason for it. But sometimes there is no immediate reason. 

Usually a lot of men can be quite technical, where they want to pinpoint the reason for anxiety and solve it.

In the end, you could explain anxiety, or any other disorder, by looking at genetical predisposition and environmental factors such as childhood experiences or drug use. But that doesn't help you.

I think what's best to say in these situations is ""you're making me feel worse"". Confront them with how black and white they see the anxiety and hand them a mirror for their own behavior. ",3,joogroo,"I completely get it. People often don't understand that anxiety, especially generalized anxiety disorder, can be totally unprovoked and unpredictable. It's like your brain is constantly on high alert, and you can't just ""snap out of it"" or find a specific reason to explain it. I've been there too, and it's frustrating when others minimize our feelings or tell us to ""just eat"" or ""just calm down"" like it's that easy.

But here's the thing: your feelings are valid, and it's okay to not have a reason for feeling anxious. It doesn't mean you're overreacting or being dramatic. It just means your brain is wired differently, and that's okay. If you ever want to talk about it or just need someone to vent to, I'm here for you. I've found that having people who understand can make a big difference. Let's connect and support each other through these tough times.","

gqmycs,Anxiety,Does anyone else have intense fear that they‚Äôll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,hocrm,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill ‚Äújinx‚Äù it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she‚Äôs independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way &lt;3 )*",846,74,1590453859,"If you end up being 27 and living with your parents then so be it. I'm 26 and live with my parents still. Have battled unemployment, depression, anxiety, and other shit but my parents still support me. You should look at it this way, enjoy having that support and family around as much as you can, because it won't always be like that. I was the same way when I was your age, all I can suggest is to push yourself but don't rush it. I didn't get my license until I was 21. It's hard to imagine yourself doing those things you said but you can do it, and I'm sure you will do most if not all of the things you mentioned.",103,JulianGiraffe,,0,,"I totally get where you're coming from. It's like, you're caught between the comfort and security of your family, and the fear of stepping out into the unknown. I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling, even if they don't always admit it.

First of all, let me just say that it's completely okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. It's normal to not have all the answers, and it's great that you're acknowledging your anxiety and wanting to work through it.

One thing that might help is to take things one step at a time. Don't feel like you need to tackle everything at once. Start with small, manageable tasks, like paying for your own shopping or taking a short walk around your neighborhood. As you get more confident, you can gradually take on more responsibilities.

Also, remember that independence doesn't mean you have to do everything on your own all the time. It's okay to ask for help and support when you need it. And, just because you're becoming more independent, it doesn't mean you're going to lose your family or be alone. You can still maintain close relationships with your loved ones while also developing your own sense of self and autonomy.

You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're reaching out for support. Keep taking things one step at a time, and remember to be kind to yourself along the way.","

It's also important to acknowledge that your anxiety is valid, even if it doesn't seem rational to others.

I hope this helps in some way.",864,55,1569288922,"This sounds like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

Another good metaphor that I like is imagining yourself on a bridge looking below at 3 different trains on 3 tracks. One train carries carts full of your thoughts, one carries your physical responses to those thoughts , and the last carries your urges to act( e. g escape the situation). The idea is to try stay on the bridge without getting involved with anything on the tracks. Just watch the trains pass and just notice. It really helps to desensitize you.",140,UrbanUnicornz,[deleted],62,[deleted],"I love this phrase, and I'm so glad you shared it with us. The idea of observing our thoughts without getting caught up in them is a game-changer for managing anxiety. It's all about cultivating that sense of detachment and learning to acknowledge our thoughts without judgment.

I think it's really helpful to remember that our thoughts are just thoughts - they don't define our reality. By noticing them and letting them pass, we can break the cycle of rumination and anxiety. It's not always easy, of course, but with practice and patience, it can become more natural.

Your therapist's phrase is a great reminder to be gentle with ourselves and our thoughts. It's not about suppressing or avoiding our emotions, but about learning to navigate them with kindness and curiosity. Thanks for sharing this valuable insight, and I hope it helps others in our community as well.","

icv4t1,Anxiety,Just went to the dentist for the first time in ten years,SexyAbeLincoln,"And it was fine! No cavities, good x-rays. 

When I got out of college I was broke and didn't have insurance, so I stopped going to the dentist. After a while I finally got a decent job and dental insurance, but my anxiety had become worse and my shame/avoidance behaviors kicked in. The more time that passed, the more shame I felt about not having been to the dentist. So I just didn't go. 

I don't know what changed recently, but the other day I just looked up a place with good reviews and made an appointment before I could think about it too much. I told them it had been a few years so I didn't have any x-rays to send over. Nobody made a big deal about it. The dental hygenist and the dentist were both very kind. Also, apparently these days they let you watch Netflix while your teeth are being cleaned?? Back in my day your only entertainment was the sound of metal scraping against tooth enamel. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. None of my friends know about this because I'm too embarrassed to admit to it, but I'm very proud of myself.

I can only imagine how daunting it must have felt, especially with anxiety and shame weighing you down. It's amazing that you were able to push past those feelings and just make the appointment.

I love that you brought up the shame and avoidance aspect, because I think that's something a lot of people struggle with, but don't always talk about. It's so important to acknowledge that those feelings are valid, but also that they don't have to hold us back.

Your message of 'you're not alone' really resonated with me, and I'm sure with others who might be reading this. It's a great reminder that we all have our own struggles and fears, but taking small steps towards addressing them can make a huge difference.

Thanks for sharing your story and being brave enough to be vulnerable. You should be proud of yourself, and I'm glad you're taking care of your health.""","

It's also really admirable that you're taking responsibility for your own mental health and being proactive about finding ways to manage your anxiety.

b137g2,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? Read more inside.,saltyman420,"What‚Äôs up y‚Äôall, hope you are all doing well.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I‚Äôd always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I‚Äôm gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I‚Äôm doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what‚Äôs plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It‚Äôs kinda because it‚Äôs a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I‚Äôm like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks.",814,102,1552584798,"One of my hobbies is I'm a musician... A lot of the time my mind is focused on the fact that I'm not good enough and what other people think of the stuff I make (Especially when I cross reference stuff)... It not only makes me less creative but makes me demoralized and just want to quit all together so I don't work on stuff... as a result I don't improve and that feeds back into the problem. Its not just music either... but my university work too. 

In summary I feel this all the damn time and I hate it so much...",88,-Arrez-,"Honestly, I feel like this just comes with being an adult. Your job, bills, relationships, family issues... these things take a lot mental energy and leave me with little else. ",1,Annethraxxx,"I totally get where you're coming from. I've been there too - it's like your mind has shifted from exploring possibilities to just trying to survive the day. Anxiety can be a major creativity killer, and it's easy to get stuck in that cycle of negative thoughts.

One thing that's helped me is to make time for activities that bring me joy and spark curiosity, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. It could be drawing, writing, or even just browsing Reddit (lol). The key is to do something that takes your mind off your worries and lets you explore new ideas.

Another thing to consider is that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to acknowledge your anxiety and take steps to manage it. You don't have to have it all figured out, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. Remember that your creative spark is still in there, and with a little patience and self-care, you can start to reignite it.

You're not alone in this, and I'm rooting for you to break free from that cycle and tap back into your curious and creative side.","

I've experienced this too - when a friend or family member is going through a tough time, I instantly go into ""support mode"" and my own worries take a backseat.

I think this speaks to the power of empathy and connection. When we focus on helping others, it can actually help us feel more grounded and less anxious. It's almost like our brains are wired to respond to others' needs before our own.

As for taking your own advice seriously, maybe try to reframe it as ""self-care"" instead of ""advice."" When you're offering support to others, you're essentially practicing self-care by distracting yourself from your own anxiety. So, try to be kinder to yourself and acknowledge that you're already doing something amazing - you're helping others, and that's a beautiful thing. Keep being that rock for others, and don't forget to be kind to yourself too!","

nmx0ru,Anxiety,I always feel like I'm bothering people,Throwaway0198701,"Every time I think about messaging someone, I always think ""Will they think I'm annoying?"" or ""Do they really even care?""

Every time I get the same feeling that I'm being annoying or bothering them.

I don't know what to do I'm too afraid to message old friends or just people in general.

Then there's the question ""Will they think I don't care about them?"" because of how little I message them and they don't know how hard it is for me to message them.

Am I just being a bitch? I can't bring myself to just message them, even though I want to.

Anyone got advice?",870,46,1622205813,"I struggled with this for a while too, until my therapist gave me a technique that completely relieved these thoughts for me.

Here's what she told me:

First, pick three or four characteristics that you would want people to describe you as. I chose supportive, kind, intelligent, and calm. Take your time and really reflect on what your ideal self would be like. Once you choose your words, think of these as your *objectives.* 

When you are socializing, all that is in your power is being the most \*your characteristics\* as you can. In your case, (I'll use my words for this example), you are afraid of reaching out to people, but if your message is kind, supportive, calm, and intelligent, then what more can you do? If you are being the best you can be, there is no reason to live up to other people's expectations of you. If they are actually bothered by you, then it is their issue, not yours. 

I personally struggled with replaying scenes of socializing with people in my head afterward, so I would use this to sort of grade myself - I would ask, ""was I as supportive as I could have been? How so?"" and then go through all of my characteristics.

I recommend putting little sticky notes around your house, or put a note on your phone to remind you of this. It took a little bit for me to actually accept that this is all that I can do, but now, I never worry about what other people think of me because I am simply trying to be the best version of myself, and if someone doesn't like that, then that is their burden, not mine, and it shouldn't be yours either.

I hope this helps :) and please ask for clarification if I didn't explain clearly enough!",193,hankhan18,"I feel like this to, it‚Äôs not true though. It‚Äôs just our brains playing tricks on us. The people in our lives love us more then we think",11,sasha_Black03,"I totally get where you're coming from. It's like you're stuck in this vicious cycle of overthinking every message. I've been there too, and it can be really debilitating.

First of all, let's put this to rest: you're not a ""bitch"" for feeling this way. It's actually a sign that you care deeply about the people in your life and value their time.

Here's what might help: try to reframe your thinking. Instead of assuming you're bothering people, remind yourself that they're probably happy to hear from you. If they weren't, they wouldn't be in your life. And if they're truly bothered, they'll let you know.

Start small. Send a casual message to someone you feel comfortable with, like a funny meme or a quick hello. See how they respond. It might help you build up your confidence.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to take time to reach out. People understand that life gets busy, and they're not expecting constant updates. Just be genuine and sincere when you do message them, and they'll likely appreciate the effort.","

So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself.",850,66,1554907846,"Your next step would be to politely ask if they mind watching the news instead. I know that‚Äôs a huge feat when you have anxiety, but you are not a burden, and they may even feel appreciated that you value their opinion. Or another solution could be headphones and streaming something if that‚Äôs available for you. But I suppose that could also be counter productive if you‚Äôre trying to challenge your anxiety by staying connected with your outside world and not staying in a technological bubble. Either way, I AM PROUD OF YOU! :)",148,PoblanoMyOmelette,"I never have watched the 700 club and I rarely partake in watching TV evangelism,  but I will say a few things about this. 

First, I am shocked this post was upvoted so many times. And I truly believe it wasn‚Äôt upvoted because of the victory you had, but because you made a very stressed point about not wanting to hear anything about Jesus. 

It deeply... deeply saddens me, grieves me to see such repulsiveness to the lord on your part. Where you are willing or have the thought of leaving to your car to get away from him. Before you stop reading, and yes I am speaking directly to the original poster, please hear me out. 

What exactly did God do to you to cause you to be so repulsed by him? Don‚Äôt blame it on the hosts. Because I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what this is all about. 

God, Jesus Christ, didn‚Äôt do anything to you to cause you harm. He didn‚Äôt cause any of this world to act the way it does. Mankind, in all his ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù fights tooth and nail against God because he thinks he knows better. And satan and his army of demons, work in the invisible world and heavenly places to seek out and destroy us. It is satan, not God who causes strife. 

If anything, you should be repulsed by CNN or any other news network for that matter, especially modern pop culture. It‚Äôs filled with the work of satan. 

Let me stress this again, God did not do anything to you to cause YOU to hate him. You hate him because you‚Äôve been deceived. 

God has done EVERYTHING he could to save us from our sin. When he said, ‚Äúit is finished,‚Äù on the cross, he meant it. Anyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved, our salvation is sealed in him. 

The fact is, in your current mindset and where your heart is, you are going to hell. Many are on that path. Many! The Bible says so. 

God loves us so much. You have NO IDEA how much he loves us. If you think for a second how hard this worldly life is, imagine how bad hell will be. With no second chances. And eternal separation from Jesus Christ, his love and his glory. 

Yes, I‚Äôm approaching this the classical hated way by so many who disbelieve by bringing hell into the equation. And I am standing my ground in this. Because that‚Äôs the final verdict for all who deny the one and ONLY living God. 

My intention is not to fear you into allowing the lord into your heart. My intention is to show you what‚Äôs on the line. God, is beyond good. He offers love like you‚Äôve never experienced. Your family, husband, kids or no one else can even come close to the love Christ offers. He is a gracious, loving, merciful and forgiving God. He‚Äôs coming back soon. 

I would hate to see you continue to hold on to so much hate for him and be eternally separated in complete agony. Christ said there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth there. Is it really worth leaning on your own understanding for these things? Your own understanding will get you no where. 

I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice all of my karma to stress to you how wrong you are right now. And it‚Äôs out of love. 

Over 700 people upvoted this post and it goes to show just how far separated we are from Christ. It deeply saddens me. We all have our own choices to make. And mine right now is to scream at you as loud as I can and say go the other way. You won‚Äôt be let down. 

What hope is there for any of us to live a part from God? Honestly ask yourself this question. What really matters in your life a part from God? My belief is a part from God, nothing.... absolutely nothing matters in this life.  If God is not the head of our life, we are dust in the wind. 

I pray you come to Christ someday. You won‚Äôt be popular, people will hate you, you won‚Äôt be upvoted, you‚Äôll be down voted because you speak in his name. But that‚Äôs ok. Jesus said the world hated him first and so we‚Äôll be hated as well as a result.

Wake up people! Jesus is coming back soon. Don‚Äôt be deceived! The day of the lord is at hand! And I can‚Äôt wait for it. But in the meantime, I desperately want to see people on Christ‚Äôs side. Not their own  misdirected side. 

Out of love to all! 

Amen brothers and sisters.",-6,Makingchanges33,"I totally get why you'd feel uncomfortable with that show on, and I'm impressed that you spoke up and asked to change the channel. It's understandable that you didn't want to create tension with the other patients, especially with the label concerns you mentioned.

I think changing it to local news was a great compromise - it's neutral and informative, and like you said, no proselytizing. Next time, you could also consider asking the staff if they have any alternative options or channels they can put on instead. They might be more open to accommodating requests than you think, especially if it makes patients feel more at ease.

Kudos to you for taking a stand (albeit a small one) and asserting your comfort in a space that's supposed to be supportive. Your pride is well-deserved!","

It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate lately, and it's understandable that your anxiety has spiked. That feeling of ""if I stop worrying, something bad will happen"" is a classic anxiety trap. It's like your brain is trying to protect you by constantly being on the lookout for potential dangers, but it's actually just perpetuating the cycle of worry.

One thing that might help is to remind yourself that you can't control everything. It's okay to acknowledge the ""what ifs,"" but try not to get too caught up in them. Instead, focus on what you can control, like taking care of yourself and seeking support when you need it.

It might also be helpful to try some grounding techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to calm your mind and bring yourself back to the present moment. And hey, it's okay to not be okay ‚Äì it's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious. You're not alone in this.","

Also there's the whole ""don't let them win"" thing. Don't let domestic terrorism events make you scared to live your life because that's often the goal of the perpetrators- to instill terror.

Also, knowing your emergency exits and having an exit plan is important in any group event. That's true for any type of emergency. Could help make you feel a little better.",260,Szikk,"I hate that we all have to feel this way. like let's go to the beach and relax, oh wait let me pack my Kevlar flak jacket and helmet and riot shield. Or grocery shopping, or in school, or at the park, it's kill or be killed everywhere you go and people act like the solution is to strap yourself up and walk around like Dirty Harry or Mad Max and never trust anyone and never sleep and never relax...sorry for ranting but I feel your anxiety and our leadership has no solutions except more guns, more cops, more punishment, more oppression, no room to breathe",77,Dizzy_Slice7886,"I totally get why you'd be feeling anxious about this. Mass shootings are a harsh reality, and it's natural to worry about safety in public spaces. However, it's also important to remember that the chances of something tragic happening are extremely low. 

Instead of letting fear hold you back, maybe try to focus on the things you can control, like being aware of your surroundings and having a plan in place in case of an emergency. It might also help to remind yourself of all the times you've been to public events or gatherings without incident.

It's great that you're excited about the beach festival, and it would be a shame to let fear stop you from experiencing it. Consider talking to your boyfriend about your concerns, and maybe even make a plan together for how you'll stay safe and enjoy the event. Remember, it's okay to feel scared, but don't let it dictate your life.","

You could try writing a note or sending a text to let them know you need some space, or even just putting on headphones to signal that you're not up for conversation. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and take care of yourself, even if it means not being as social as others expect.

kduds3,Anxiety,My therapist told me I have anxiety attacks for attention,sadboi_catto,"So I have been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I started college this past fall. I saw a counselor there who was marginally helpful but my anxiety just seemed to get worse, and after talking to some friends with similar issues I thought it might be good to try medication for it as well as therapy. I'm on break now and I decided to start seeing a therapist back home who my parents recommended to me. I told her about my anxiety and how it was affecting my ability to do schoolwork and how I'm terrified of driving so I still only have a permit at the age of 19, and how I'm really afraid of phone calls. She straight up told me that I am only acting like this ""because I like the attention"". That really bothered  me because I really want to be independent and I feel really guilty for inconveniencing other people, and I always feel guilty about having panic attacks because I know my friends and family are going to worry about me. But I could be trying to minimize my faults to make myself feel better...I don't know what to believe. Is it reasonable to get upset over this? Is she actually right and I just need to listen to her?

First of all, let me reassure you that it's completely reasonable to feel upset about this. Anxiety and panic attacks are very real struggles, and it's not something you can just ""choose"" to have for attention.

It's actually pretty impressive that you're recognizing your own feelings of guilt and trying to consider the therapist's perspective, but in this case, I think it's safe to say that her comment was not only hurtful but also misguided. Anxiety is a complex issue that can't be reduced to just seeking attention.

I would strongly advise you to consider finding a new therapist who is more understanding and supportive. It's great that you're taking proactive steps by seeing a psychiatrist for medication, and I hope that helps alleviate some of your symptoms. Remember that you're not ""useless"" or ""deluded"" - you're just someone who needs support and understanding.

I suddenly feel like I have nothing to offer and will never find professional or romantic security and I‚Äôve gone to bed in tears every single night for the past week.

I think we constantly tell ourselves (albeit unconsciously) that we will feel worthy, good enough, qualified after we achieve it. But every achievement feels like a stroke of luck or coincidence, and it doesn't give us the feeling that we thought we would get. And we tell ourselves that the achievement is not good enough, but the next one will be. And the cycle continues.

Over time I learned to appreciate myself for who I am and stop taking myself so seriously. So I'm starting to emphasize on processes than achievements.",21,jaschong,"I totally get it, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's like, you finally start to gain momentum and feel proud of yourself, and then anxiety swoops in and tries to take it all away. It's exhausting and unfair.

First of all, let's acknowledge that what you've accomplished this year is actually huge. Leaving a job you hated and ending an unhealthy relationship takes a ton of courage, and it's something to be proud of, no matter what your anxiety is telling you right now.

I think it might be helpful to try to separate your accomplishments from your worth as a person. You are more than your job or your relationship status - you are a person with unique strengths and talents, and you deserve to feel good about yourself regardless of your current circumstances.

Also, don't underestimate the power of small steps. When you're feeling overwhelmed, it can be hard to take big action, but tiny, manageable steps can add up and help you regain your footing. Would love to hear more about what's been going on and offer any support I can.","

As a healthcare worker, you're on the frontlines of this pandemic, and it's taking a toll on your mental and physical health. The fact that you're still being asked to work despite a positive test is unacceptable and concerning.

Firstly, please take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being. If you feel like going into work is putting your health at risk, it's okay to advocate for yourself and push back against your superiors. You're not alone in this - many healthcare workers are feeling burned out and frustrated.

It's also important to remember that you're not responsible for the state of the country or the actions of others. You're doing your part by working in healthcare and trying to make a difference. Don't lose sight of that.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a support hotline. They can provide you with guidance and resources to cope with your anxiety and stress. Remember, you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

Apparently I also have an RBF, so people at my old school have told me that I was intimidating or they thought I was angry or something.

I've been in those situations where I felt like I was going to say something stupid, so I just said nothing at all. It's like my brain would freeze, and I'd be left standing there, smiling awkwardly. 

It's really frustrating when people misinterpret our silence as being rude or snobby. I've had people tell me the same thing - that they thought I was standoffish or unfriendly at first, but once they got to know me, they realized that wasn't the case at all.

One thing that's helped me is to focus on asking questions instead of trying to come up with something witty to say. People generally like talking about themselves, and it takes the pressure off of me to be the center of attention. Also, it's okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts before responding - it's not like you have to have a clever quip ready to go at all times.

Here's the thing: it's okay to just have a regular day on your birthday. You don't have to put on a show or pretend to be excited if you're not feeling it. Maybe take some time to reflect on what would actually make you happy today. Is it just having a quiet day at home? Is it doing something low-key with a few close friends?

It's like that one comment or laugh can instantly transport you back to those years of bullying, right? I'm not saying I went through the same thing, but I've definitely had my share of anxiety when it comes to social situations.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking. When you hear a group laughing, instead of assuming they're laughing at you, try telling yourself that they're probably just enjoying each other's company. It's not about you, it's about them having a good time.

Also, remember that you're not alone in this. Many people have had similar experiences, and it's okay to still be working through it even at 25. It's not ridiculous, it's just a part of your journey.

Lastly, try to be kind to yourself. When you start to feel that anxiety creeping in, take a deep breath and remind yourself of how far you've come. You're stronger than you think, and you've survived all those years of bullying. You got this.""","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?

POST BODY: **EDIT:** Wow I didn't think I'd get this many comments. I'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! 

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. 

I especially have this with groups of teenagers, I'm genuinely afraid of them lol

If I'm in a group I might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.

What's your experience been with this? Did you eventually get over it?

ed5jr6,Anxiety,I got a 4.0 this semester in college!,vaguefully," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think.

I can only imagine how tough it must have been to deal with anxiety, depression, and health issues on top of academic pressures. It's amazing that you persevered and pushed through, and your accomplishment is truly something to be proud of.

Your advice on seeking support and accommodations is spot on - I've seen so many people struggle in silence, and it's great that you're spreading the word about the importance of prioritizing mental and physical health. Don't underestimate the strength it takes to ask for help, and it's awesome that you're encouraging others to do the same.

j33o28,Anxiety,Does anyone else start getting super anxious as bedtime approaches?,squirreliesquirrel,"As soon as it‚Äôs nighttime and my body knows bedtime is approaching, I begin to feel low and anxious no matter how good of a day I‚Äôve had. I know it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm worried about insomnia and being alone with my thoughts and worries once there‚Äôs no more distractions. Most of my worries are about trying to plan my future and about losing my loved ones. I get panicked over the thought that my something bad will happen to my family and I won‚Äôt be able to cope with that heartbreak. This has gone on for many years and it‚Äôs truly exhausting. It‚Äôs like my brain thinks if I worry about it enough, it won‚Äôt happen. I know that may not make sense because I don‚Äôt understand it either, but I don‚Äôt have any other explanation. Thank you for reading this. If anyone of you have dealt with nighttime anxiety and worries like this, I‚Äôd love to hear what helped you. I‚Äôm really tired of feeling like this.",736,175,1601535557,"That sounds like intrusive thoughts flooding your head right when your brain has the chance to recline and reflect.

It's like your brain is trying to protect you from potential heartbreak by worrying about it non-stop, but it's actually having the opposite effect. I've dealt with similar nighttime anxiety, and it's exhausting.

One thing that helped me was learning to acknowledge and accept my thoughts without judgment. When I start to spiral, I remind myself that my worries are just thoughts, not reality. I also try to focus on the present moment and what I can control. It's hard, but it's helped me to reframe my thinking.

Another thing that's helped is creating a relaxing bedtime routine, like reading or taking a warm bath. It signals to my brain that it's time to wind down and helps me to calm my thoughts. Lastly, I've found that journaling can be a great way to process my thoughts and worries, so I try to write down what's on my mind before bed.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. If you ever need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted friend or a professional.","

gkttro,Anxiety,Does anyone else‚Äôs anxiety cause abdominal issues?,SensitiveBorder2,"After moving a year and a half ago I started having bouts of severe abdominal cramping followed with...lets just say it sped things up. This has happened once or twice a month for 17 months now and I never had prior issues. My doc thinks it‚Äôs just irritable bowel (a really common thing especially with anxiety) I‚Äôm worried about something like Crohn‚Äôs disease with how bad the cramping can get. All my bloods were normal except low B12 implying some level of malabsorption.

Still I‚Äôm just curious if anyone with anxiety like me has had GI upset from it often, I never had issues before but obviously moving was quite a jump and stressful time.

EDIT: I was tested for Celiac, since my father had it they actually checked for the gene and I do not carry it. So that‚Äôs ruled out 99.9%",737,173,1589631910,Yes. From my understands it‚Äôs a fairly common anxiety symptom. I often get an upset stomach on anxious days.,129,[deleted],"Yes, and I have Crohn‚Äôs too. For me, I can feel the difference between the anxiety cramps and then the rush it causes, and a Crohns flare up or the standard Crohns pain. The burning cramping feeling for me is always anxiety related and an IBS issue, whereas for me, Crohns feels like my intestines are trying to digest glass. But if you feel like something really isn‚Äôt right, then ask for a second opinion. I was misdiagnosed for 5 years before I got the correct diagnosis and treatment!",1,preachitpickle,"I totally get it, anxiety can be a real gut-wrecker (pun intended). I've struggled with anxiety for years, and I've noticed a direct correlation between my stress levels and GI issues. It's like my body has a sixth sense for when I'm freaking out, and it decides to join the party with some lovely cramps and digestive woes.

It's great that you've already taken some steps to rule out other potential causes, like Celiac disease. Given your low B12 levels and malabsorption, it's possible that your anxiety is exacerbating any underlying issues. Have you considered talking to a therapist or trying some relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga? These can help calm your nervous system and potentially ease your GI symptoms.

Remember, it's not just about managing your anxiety; it's also about taking care of your physical health. Keep working with your doc to figure out what's going on, and don't be afraid to explore other options, like a gastroenterologist or a nutritionist. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.","

jn9o4i,Anxiety,"Terrorist attack happened in my city yesterday, I feel like I'm going to break down",OrdinaryCow7,"Yesterday evening my city was hit by a terrible terrorist attack. Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside. 

Whoever read this far, thank you. I don't even know why I wrote this. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it somehow.",839,70,1604407676,I‚Äôm so sorry,167,SuccessfulPast9,I‚Äôm so sorry,167,SuccessfulPast9,"I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious after a traumatic event like this, especially since it happened in a place that's so familiar to you. It's like your sense of safety and security has been shaken to the core.

First of all, please don't worry about your exam tomorrow. Your mental health and well-being should be your top priority right now. If you feel like you're not in a good place to take the exam, maybe consider talking to your university about rescheduling or getting an extension.

It's great that you have a therapist, and I would definitely reach out to them as soon as possible. They can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies to deal with your anxiety. In the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself - get plenty of rest, eat well, and try to do things that bring you comfort and relaxation.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Your community is going through a tough time, and it's okay to feel scared and vulnerable. But with time, support, and self-care, you'll get through this.","

I just stayed at home for hours pretty much doing nothing, feeling sad for no reason, but I was under the impression we would all go to a club tonight anyways so I figured i'd save up my social energy for that. And my roommates came home and don't want to go to the club anymore, so now I'm feeling awful and anxious and so sad that I didn't go, I SHOULD have gone and now I have so much regret and anxiety that I missed out. I think I would have had so much fun but yet again I feel like I missed out, and wasted my night. This keeps happening, I really have to get better at forcing myself to just do things...",851,58,1529524913,"You may try making a little pact with yourself before you go. Like, I'll stay for 30 minutes and if I'm not having a good time, I'll leave. Quite a few times I've done this, and when the 30 minutes are up most of my anxiety has subsided and I'll end up staying and having fun. Just getting out the door if often the hardest part for me. 

If you do decide to stay home, stick to it! Find something fun to do solo so you don't end up wondering what's happening at the party and thinking about what you're missing out on.

Good luck! As someone with social anxiety, I can totally relate to this.",203,strangeXpowers,"Oh I know this feel very well. It just shows you how stupid those false alarms of anxiety are. It's a useless feeling that just scares you without reason and causes you pain regardless of what you do.

Try not to let anxiety take over and stop you from doing something you want to do. The more you let it bar you from events and parties, the harder it will be to break out of that thought pattern. Next time try pushing yourself a bit more, and eventually you will be able to go and have fun without being freaked out. Good luck!",3,Pandasticus,"I totally get it. It's like you're stuck in this cycle of anxiety, and it's hard to know what to do. First of all, let's acknowledge that it's not silly at all - social anxiety is a real thing, and it takes a lot of courage to admit when you're struggling with it.

It sounds like you're beating yourself up over missing out on the party, but honestly, it might be helpful to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on what you missed, try to think about what you were trying to protect yourself from - the anxiety and discomfort of being in a big social situation. That takes a lot of self-awareness, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs sometimes.

That being said, I also get that you don't want to let anxiety hold you back. One thing that might help is to start small - try to push yourself to do one small social thing a week, and see how it goes. It could be as simple as grabbing coffee with a friend or going for a walk with a classmate. Baby steps, right?","

But here's the thing: by holding her gaze and getting that smile, you broke through that barrier, even if just for a second. And that's something to build on. It shows you that you're capable of more than you thought.

As for the insecurity, I think it's normal to feel that way, especially when we're interested in someone. But maybe it's not about what you're lacking, but about what you're already bringing to the table. You're worth noticing, and that girl's smile proved it.

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn‚Äôt pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn‚Äôt want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said ‚Äú I know you need me tonight but I don‚Äôt know if I am strong enough.‚Äù She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. ‚ÄúBut I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.‚Äù 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn‚Äôt have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come.",879,29,1590211622,"This makes me super happy. I have an anxiety disorder and sometimes it makes me feel like I can‚Äôt be supportive of my boyfriend because I‚Äôm constantly in my own head. But I‚Äôve also been working on being a better partner for him and being there when he needs me, even if I‚Äôm not feeling okay, because he‚Äôs there when I need him too. I think it actually makes me feel a bit stronger, like I can break away from the anxiety and focus on him and what he needs too.",167,behemoth9797,"Hey I feel like we are in similar situations. Although I‚Äôm not married I‚Äôve been with my partner for 5 years now and go through pretty much what you mentioned.

Feel free to send a PM or chat request if you wanna tLk.",15,cryingmetsfan,"I can only imagine how tough it must be for both of you to navigate these situations. It's amazing that you're prioritizing her well-being and taking care of yourself at the same time. That in itself takes a lot of love, patience, and understanding.

I love that you're acknowledging her progress and the effort she's putting into managing her anxiety. That breakthrough tonight is huge, and it's clear that she's working hard to be more present for you.

One thing that stood out to me was her saying ""I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you."" It shows that she's aware of her limitations and is committed to growing and being there for you. It's not always easy to admit when we're not strong enough, but it takes a lot of courage to do so.

Keep supporting and encouraging each other ‚Äì it's clear that you're both in this together. Celebrate these small victories, and don't underestimate the power of acknowledging each other's efforts. You two are a team, and it's beautiful to see.","

9xzrbl,Anxiety,Did your child self think that your adult self would be completely confident and have it all figured out?,byondhalp,"When I (f26) was in school I always imagined that by mid-20s I‚Äôd be completely comfortable in my own skin and wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about what other people thought. I just assumed that came with being an adult. Yet here I am, still feeling like I‚Äôm at the bottom of the food chain in social situations, and still just as anxious and doubtful of myself as I was 10 years ago.
It‚Äôs so weird. On paper I‚Äôve achieved so many of the things I had hoped for myself... I should feel good about myself by now, or at least have enough evidence that I‚Äôm not a total piece of shit. 

Childhood me would be saying ‚Äúhow can you still not believe in yourself? How can you STILL be living so fearfully?‚Äù

Keep going OP, you'll get there. üòä",79,daisylea,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. I think it's really common for people to assume that becoming an adult will magically fix all their insecurities and anxieties, but the truth is, it's a continuous process of growth and self-improvement.

One thing that might be helpful is to reframe your thinking around ""achieving"" confidence and self-assurance. Instead of thinking you need to reach some kind of endpoint where you're completely fearless and self-assured, try to focus on the small, incremental steps you're taking every day.

It's also worth recognizing that anxiety and self-doubt are super common, even among people who seem totally put-together. Nobody posts about their struggles on Instagram, right?

I'm glad you're giving CBT a shot, even if it's not clicking yet. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right approach, so don't give up. And in the meantime, try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge the tiny victories, even if they feel insignificant. You're doing better than you think, and just showing up to this conversation is proof of that.","

Like listening to a lecture and the professor's mic crackles, or the sink faucet spurts a little bit, stuff like that.

I've been there too - those tiny, unexpected noises can be incredibly startling, and it's like my whole body is on high alert, waiting for the next 'jumpscare'. For me, it's definitely linked to anxiety. When I'm feeling more anxious, those little noises can be overwhelming, and it's like my nervous system is hyper-sensitive.

One thing that's helped me is to acknowledge that it's not just me being 'jumpy' or 'sensitive' - it's actually a sign of how much my body is trying to protect me from potential threats (which, in this case, are just harmless noises). It's like my brain is constantly on the lookout for danger, even when there isn't any.

In terms of managing it, I've found that some mindfulness exercises and deep breathing can really help calm me down and reduce my startle response. It's not a magic fix, but it's helped me feel more in control. You're not alone in this, OP, and there are people who understand what you're going through.","

97u41j,Anxiety,Downvotes make me extremely scared about what i said wrong,snowskrubberr,"No, this is not an excuse to stop downvotes. They have a purpose on reddit, i realize that.

As frivolous as this may seem, i want to know if im not the only one who thinks this.

Downvotes can sting, especially when you're already feeling down. It's like, you're trying to share your thoughts or connect with others, and instead, you're met with this negative feedback that can be hard to shake off.

First of all, know that you're not alone in this feeling. I think many of us have been there at some point. One thing that might help is to try to separate your self-worth from your Reddit comments/posts. Remember that a downvote (or even multiple downvotes) doesn't define your worth as a person.

When I get a downvote, I try to take a step back and ask myself if it's really worth dwelling on. More often than not, it's just someone who disagrees or didn't understand my point. And that's okay. We can't please everyone, and that's what makes Reddit so interesting, right?

Don't delete your posts/comments just because of a few downvotes. Your voice matters, and someone out there might really appreciate what you have to say. Keep sharing, and don't let the downvotes get you down!","

It's great that you're recognizing this pattern and acknowledging that it's exhausting. One thing that might help is to focus on the common thread running through all these anxiety sources ‚Äì the underlying fear or insecurity that's driving them. For you, it might be a fear of not being good enough or not meeting certain standards.

Rather than trying to tackle each individual anxiety source, you might want to explore this deeper fear and work on building self-compassion and self-acceptance. It's not always easy, but it can be a powerful way to reduce anxiety in the long run. And I'm glad you're considering seeking professional help ‚Äì sometimes we need that extra support to work through these issues.

First of all, know that you're not alone, and it's not about being lazy or uncaring. It's just your brain's way of trying to protect itself from potential social awkwardness or rejection.

One thing that helped me was to set a timer for 5-10 minutes after receiving a message, and challenge myself to respond within that time frame. It doesn't have to be a perfect response ‚Äì just something to acknowledge the person and show that I'm not ignoring them.

Another thing is to remind yourself that most people are busy and won't even notice (or care) if you respond a day or two later. And honestly, even if they do think you're a bit slow to respond, it's not the end of the world. They're probably not thinking about it as much as you are.

They‚Äôre my favorite comfort viewing.",89,PitchOk5203,"I'm so glad you shared this, OP. It's amazing how certain shows can become our comfort zones, and I'm definitely guilty of having my own 'calm-down' shows. I've watched Parks and Rec so many times, but there's just something about Leslie Knope's positivity that instantly lifts my mood.

I think it's great that you've found shows that work for you, and it's not weird at all - in fact, it's genius. Familiarity can be really comforting when we're feeling anxious or stressed, and it's awesome that you've found your own 'safety blanket' shows.

I also love that you mentioned trying Brooklyn 99 - it's a great example of how sometimes, all we need is a change of scenery (or a new show) to help us relax. If you're open to more suggestions, I'd recommend Schitt's Creek or The Great British Baking Show - they're both super calming and hilarious.

Thanks for sharing, and I'm so happy to see that you're not alone in this. We're all in good company here!","

9g1bwv,Anxiety,Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,FleshEatinThugRpllnt,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.
Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down. Sorry for the rant, and thanks for your time if you did choose to read through this, I hope you all lead long, fulfilling lifes.

P.S. Idk if I should start going to counselling for issues like this, do you think it could be beneficial to someone like me?",799,104,1537016952,"I find alcohol makes my anxiety flare up the day after, if I had got really drunk the night before. I didn't drink super often  but  the after effects I experienced mentally were bad enough to make me quit completely for a while. 

I agree it can be easier to come out of your shell, but for me at least finding balance with drinking was important. I have to drink slowly and don't ever get full on wasted anymore. The buzz helps me feel comfortable partying/talking with people/even singing karaoke but does not leave me with anxiety attacks or insecurity the next day.  

It's easy to over analyze yourself and your actions after sobering up. Can you talk to the people you were with, maybe get some reassurance about how they were receiving you? It can be anxiety inducing to have those conversations but if it's just you over analyzing, talking to them could really help you feel better.

It's great that you're recognizing these patterns and wondering if there's a better way to be yourself. Counselling could be a really helpful way to explore these feelings and work on building your confidence in social situations. Having a safe space to talk about your worries and fears can be really liberating.

It's not about ""fixing"" yourself, but about learning to be kinder to yourself and more confident in your interactions with others. And who knows, you might find that you don't need to drink to have fun and connect with people.

I think it's awesome that you acknowledged your desire for attention and didn't let it hold you back. It's completely normal to crave social interaction, and it sounds like this community's support really made a difference for you.

If you don't mind me asking, what was the highlight of your night? Was there a particular moment or experience that stood out to you? And do you think this is something you'll do again, or was it a one-time experiment?

Either way, kudos to you for taking the initiative and making the most of your Saturday night. You're an awesome example of how we can create our own fun and connections, even in unfamiliar surroundings.","

qrij6t,Anxiety,"Stop telling me to take deep, slow breaths/be mindful",orchidlighthouse,"I‚Äôm so annoyed when someone tells me I need to take deep slow breaths/use mindfulness and meditation to manage my anxiety. My anxiety feels like a train about to run me over, complete with intense, obsessional, and paranoid thinking about how I may or may not have messed up at work/how someone probably doesn‚Äôt like me/how I‚Äôm an awful person and ruined something, etc. Yet you want me to ‚Äúlisten to my breaths,‚Äù be mindful of my body and think about seagulls on a beach. Is there anything else you‚Äôd like me to do? Sprout wings and fly?",771,130,1636627164,"I think some people have touched on this already. To give it some emphasis - the time to practice mindfulness/breathing is *not* when you're in crisis. And by ""practice"", I mean building up those skills so that you learn how to use them effectively.

If someone handed you a musical instrument you don't play and told you to walk out onto a stage with an audience and an orchestra waiting and perform a random concerto, you wouldn't be able to do that, either. However, by taking small steps in a safe place, you can learn enough to build up your skills and your confidence to use those skills in an intense situation.

Genuinely, one of the things that can help an anxiety attack is using mindfulness to embrace the feeling instead of resisting it. But to get to the point where that helps instead of hurts? It takes SO. MUCH. WORK. If you can do that work, it can help enormously. Most likely, it will not be easy, nor will you see results quickly. For me, in combination with other tools, it has made a huge difference in reducing the frequency and intensity of panic episodes.",228,asliceofpi,"There is actually this funny but accurate video that was going around YouTube, check it out, it is called ""what if we talked about physical health the way we talk about mental health"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWA0es85hMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWA0es85hMs) 

It is just the not so helpful and really rude things people say to those of us experiencing mental health issues. Your post just made me thing of that. 

Sometimes advice comes from a good place, but people need to realize that they are not being helpful and sometimes making things worse.

I hope you find something that works for you and find some relief!",12,justgettingby2021,"I completely get why the whole 'take deep breaths' thing can come across as dismissive or unhelpful when you're in the midst of a full-blown anxiety attack. It's like, yeah, sure, I'll just calmly breathe my way out of this crushing existential dread. Not exactly feasible, right?

Here's the thing: mindfulness and meditation can be super helpful for managing anxiety, but they're not a magic cure-all, and they definitely aren't a replacement for actual therapy or support. If you're finding that the mindfulness thing just isn't working for you, that's okay. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution.

What might be more helpful is finding ways to challenge those intrusive thoughts and reframe them in a more realistic light. Have you tried cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)? It's a type of therapy that's specifically designed to help you manage anxiety by changing your thought patterns. It might be worth looking into. Also, just know that you're not alone in this. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.","

I had way to much to drink and all I can remember is me giving him the finger and threatening to fight him while we were playing beer pong.

It's like, the more you think about past experiences, the more you're convinced you're the human version of a facepalm emoji. I've been there too, and it can be really overwhelming.

Here's the thing: cringe is subjective, and it's often a product of our own self-criticism. Think about it - when you look back at old photos or videos of yourself, you might cringe, but others probably don't even notice the things that make you uncomfortable.

It might help to try to reframe your thinking. Instead of beating yourself up over past mistakes or awkward moments, try to focus on what you've learned from them. You've grown and changed since then, and that's something to be proud of.

Also, remember that everyone has their own ""cringe"" moments - even people who seem super confident or put-together. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to make mistakes. You're not alone in this feeling, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. Hang in there, and try to be kinder to yourself.","

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Absolutely. I use it to distract me from my thoughts but it just exacerbates them sometimes.",107,[deleted],Delete your Facebook. You'll see noticable improvement within days.,3,NorthWoods16,"I completely get where you're coming from. It's like your phone has become a double-edged sword - it's both a necessary tool for your current situation and a source of anxiety and comparison.

Firstly, acknowledge that it's amazing you're recognizing the problem and wanting to make a change. That's already a huge step. 

One thing that might help is setting boundaries for yourself. Allocate specific times of the day to check your phone, and try to stick to those times. You could also consider implementing phone-free hours or days to give yourself a break.

It's also worth exploring other hobbies and activities that bring you joy and help distract you from anxiety. Since you mentioned you have hobbies, try to schedule time for those as well.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. Reach out to those you trust, and consider seeking professional help if you feel overwhelmed.

You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep in mind that it's a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.","

Never in the history of the world has an anxious person been helped by being told to calm down or relax.,73,TherapistWow,,0,,"I completely get where you're coming from with this analogy. As someone who's dealt with anxiety, I can attest that being told to ""calm down"" can be super invalidating and frustrating. It's like, if only it were that easy, right?

I think what's most important to remember is that anxiety is a legitimate response to a perceived threat, whether that's internal or external. Instead of trying to ""calm down,"" it might be more helpful to address the underlying issue or provide a supportive environment for the person to work through their feelings.

If you're on the receiving end of one of these situations, I'd encourage you to politely but firmly communicate your boundaries and needs. And if you're the one trying to offer support, just being present and empathetic can go a long way. No need to offer solutions or tell someone to ""calm down"" ‚Äì just listen and validate their emotions.","

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are many people working tirelessly to improve mental health support. While we may not have a 'magic cure' for anxiety yet, there are still many effective treatments and therapies available, such as CBT, medication, and mindfulness-based approaches.

It might be helpful to explore different types of therapy and find what works best for you. Additionally, self-care practices like exercise, meditation, and journaling can also make a big difference.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to ask for help. Reaching out to a mental health professional or a support group can be a great first step. You got this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this.","

In situations like this, it's essential to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. If you feel like you're in a situation where you're being pushed beyond your limits, don't hesitate to remove yourself from it. It's okay to excuse yourself, even if it means leaving a social gathering.

Remember that you have the right to say no and have your boundaries respected. If someone can't accept that, it's not your problem ‚Äì it's theirs. You did the right thing by taking care of yourself and leaving the situation. Take care of yourself and try to focus on the positive aspects of your life.","

It's amazing how something as simple as a magnesium supplement can have such a profound impact.

I want to encourage you to continue exploring the connection between magnesium and your anxiety, but also to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure you're getting the right dosage and ruling out any underlying conditions. It's great that you're not advocating for others to follow in your footsteps without consulting a doctor, but your experience might inspire others to look into magnesium as a potential solution.

Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time and to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this new found sense of calm. You deserve to feel this way, and it's amazing that you're giving yourself the opportunity to experience life without the weight of anxiety holding you back.""","

It's tough to feel like you're at a disadvantage, especially when it feels like societal expectations are stacked against you. First off, let's set the record straight: 4 inches is not 'bad' or 'small' - it's just one of the many variations of human anatomy. And honestly, most people care way more about the person they're with than their physical attributes.

It's awesome that you're considering dimmed lights and foreplay - that's a great way to build intimacy and focus on the experience, rather than just the physical aspect. But here's the thing: the most attractive quality you can have is confidence. Not because you're trying to hide or compensate for something, but because you're owning who you are and what you bring to the table.

Don't sell yourself short, and don't let anxiety dictate your life. You're so much more than your physical attributes, and there are people out there who will appreciate you for who you are. Keep working on that self-confidence, and I'm rooting for you.","

It sounds incredibly tough and isolating. First, I want to acknowledge that your feelings aren't stupid at all. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and stuck, especially when anxiety and depression are involved.

I've been in similar situations where the thought of 'being happy' felt like an insurmountable task. But here's the thing: you don't have to feel happy right now. You can just exist. Focus on getting through each day, and that's okay.

It might sound counterintuitive, but sometimes, letting go of the pressure to be happy can be a huge relief. Instead, try to focus on small, manageable tasks that make your daily life slightly more bearable. And when those anxious thoughts creep in, remind yourself that they're just thoughts ‚Äì they don't define your reality.

If you're comfortable, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a crisis helpline (like the National Alliance on Mental Illness or the Crisis Text Line). They can offer you support, guidance, and a safe space to talk through your feelings. You're not alone in this.","

lmxt4b,Anxiety,Dies anyone else get anxious just sending a text?,Subconsciously_Nada,"Idk why but when I just sent my friend a text I got extremely anxious do so. Took me ten min just to send it, seem relevant and concise. Then I over analysed it after I sent it, read it a million times and panic if they don't respond ugh 

Comments are the worst üòÇ

****Update**** 

Thank you all for opening the dialog. It's been nice sharing stories and experiences with details on how you felt, grew, and approached then. I thoroughly have enjoyed all these conversations. Appreciate you all , thank you üôè",783,111,1613683781,I'm always over analyzing my responses,102,wildvibrantmist,"I wonder if posting publicly more often, might be a small form of CBT and ease your texting anxiety. Just a thought.",2,Onegoofydad,"I totally feel you on this. I've been there too, overanalyzing every word, worrying about how it'll be received, and then obsessing over the response time. It's like, we're not just sending a text, we're putting our emotional state on the line.

Here's what helped me: I started practicing self-compassion. When I catch myself overthinking, I remind myself that it's just a text, and it's okay if it's not perfect. I try to focus on the intention behind the message rather than the wording. And when I don't get an immediate response, I tell myself that the other person is probably busy, not ignoring me.

It's also helpful to set a ""no re-reading"" rule for myself after sending a text. It's hard, but it saves me from getting sucked into the anxiety spiral.

Remember, it's normal to feel anxious, and it doesn't mean you're flawed or awkward. It means you care about the other person and the conversation. Thanks for sharing your experience, and I'm glad to know I'm not alone in this!","

fllu8x,Anxiety,Are some people on Reddit just...mean?,ette212,"I just started being more active on Reddit recently. I posted about something in another sub and have been stupidly watching the up / down votes and wondering why the heck someone would down vote a comment of mine that doesn't need to be down voted. From that perspective, Reddit is definitely the wrong place to be for my anxiety... I know it's not rational but I'm just wondering if this is commonly known.

*Edit:* I did not expect this post to grow as much as it did! Overall - thank you to everyone for your support. I am okay, and I would say my post was moreso an observation and also recognizing that my staring at karma isn't healthy. I'm not taking it *too* seriously but I guess it always boggles my mind when people are assholes. In general. Even though I know it's reality. And yet, there are also truly kind souls, as well.",741,152,1584666540,People can be nasty as fuck. I hate checking my messages sometimes and almost cringe.

I had to delete my imgur account for that reason :(",112,Ella_Blackheart,"Hey OP, totally get where you're coming from. It can be really disheartening to see those downvotes roll in, especially when you're just trying to share your thoughts or experiences. The thing is, those downvotes often have more to do with the downvoter's own biases or moods than anything you've actually said.

It's awesome that you're recognizing the impact this is having on your anxiety, and taking steps to address it. One thing that might help is to try to focus on the conversations and connections you're making, rather than the karma. Remember that every comment has the potential to spark a meaningful discussion or connection with someone, and that's way more valuable than any number of upvotes.

Also, try to keep in mind that for every troll or mean-spirited commenter, there are plenty of kind and supportive people on this platform. It's great that you're already experiencing that with the responses to this post. Keep sharing your thoughts, and don't let the negativity get you down!","

I can only imagine how tough it must've been to face your fears, especially with anxiety being a major obstacle. Your determination and perseverance are truly inspiring.

I love that you mentioned 'if I can do it, you can do it' - that's exactly the kind of mindset that can help others push through their own struggles. It's amazing that you were able to draw on your own inner strength to get through the test without needing any extra help.

Your story is a great reminder that it's never too late to tackle our fears and achieve our goals. I'm sure this accomplishment will give you a huge confidence boost, and who knows, maybe it'll even help you tackle other areas of your life where anxiety might be holding you back.

I‚Äôve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I‚Äôm a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school.

I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn‚Äôt turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I‚Äôm sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out.",835,58,1558959676,"I freak out in certain situations.  Like being out in the heat (hello from Southern US), being in crowded places and such.  But if a big stressful situation arises, I can usually handle it without freaking out too bad.  I don't get it.",83,AnxietyMostofTheTime,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get where you're coming from. It's like your brain is wired to freak out over tiny things, but when it comes to more serious stuff, it's just 'meh'. I've experienced similar anxiety attacks over mundane situations, and it can be really frustrating and confusing.

First off, please don't be too hard on yourself. It's not about being 'weak' or 'flawed'; it's about having a brain that's trying to cope with stress in its own way. One thing that might help is practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that your feelings are valid, even if they seem irrational. 

In terms of managing those anxiety attacks, you might want to try some grounding techniques, like focusing on your five senses (e.g., the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, etc.) to bring yourself back to the present moment. It's also a good idea to talk to a mental health professional who can help you work through these feelings and develop some coping strategies.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Hang in there, and don't be afraid to reach out for support.","

I've found that it's really helpful to surround yourself with people who validate your emotions, rather than trying to one-up or minimize them. Having a supportive network can make all the difference in feeling heard and understood.

When someone opens up to you, a simple ""I'm so sorry you're going through this"" or ""That sounds really tough"" can go a long way. You don't have to have a solution or a comparison ‚Äì just being present and acknowledging their pain can be incredibly comforting.

O.o,82,Eye_For_An_Ego,"I completely get where you're coming from. As an empath, it can be overwhelming to navigate tense situations, especially when it's in your own home. First of all, kudos to you for acknowledging that you can't fix the issue between your roommates ‚Äì that's a huge step in taking care of yourself.

It might sound simple, but have you considered setting some boundaries for yourself when it comes to their conflicts? Maybe it's as simple as giving yourself permission to leave the room or put on headphones when you feel the anxiety creeping in. It's not selfish to prioritize your own emotional well-being, especially when you're someone who's deeply empathetic.

Remember that you can't pour from an empty cup ‚Äì take care of yourself first. Whether that means scheduling solo time, practicing self-care, or finding ways to manage your anxiety, it's essential to prioritize your own happiness. You can't control the emotions of those around you, but you can control how you respond to them. Hang in there, and remember that you're not alone in this.","

wpv0xz,Anxiety,Anyone else get morning anxiety?,tfulfer,"I wake up every morning with anxiety. I will wake up a few times in the morning and feel totally fine, the anxiety kicks in when I know I have to get up and start my day. It has gotten better since starting medication but still there. Anyone else experience this?",710,182,1660658245,"Yes, to the point of vomiting for a while. I found starting my morning with stretching and a meditation/mindfulness exercise to be really helpful in grounding myself and keeping from having a total freak out. It takes practice to redirect your thoughts like that but it can be a very powerful tool in combination with medication.",184,AriaToaster,Aaah shit. And it's ALWAYS the worst.,16,MocMasterYT,"I totally get it. Morning anxiety is no joke. I used to wake up with this sense of dread, like my brain was already racing before I even opened my eyes. It's like, you're not even fully awake yet, and your mind is already stressing about the day ahead.

First of all, kudos to you for taking steps to manage your anxiety with medication. That takes a lot of courage, and it's awesome that you're seeing some improvement.

One thing that's helped me is setting a gentle morning routine. Instead of hitting the snooze button and rushing out of bed, I try to take a few minutes to breathe, stretch, and get some natural light. It's not about avoiding the day, but about easing into it. I also try to focus on one small, achievable goal for the morning, just to get myself started.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to tackle the whole day at once. Just take it one morning at a time, and be kind to yourself. You're not alone in this, and there are people here who get it.","

Do you enjoy your job? I was suffering the same way last year in my job of five years, and it got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt sit through a 30 minute meeting without excusing myself to the bathroom to stave off a panic attack. There‚Äôs honestly nothing worse than feeling like every day is a battle against yourself. I finally took a few weeks annual leave and ended up taking off 3 months unpaid. I know not everyone has the luxury of being able to do so, and I was very lucky to be able to do this, but even a short break may help you reset a little bit. The time off helped me realise that work was behind a lot of my anxiety and I‚Äôm now transitioning into a new career path and feeling amazing about it. Of course I couldn‚Äôt have done all this without therapy. If it‚Äôs possible for you I definitely recommend taking some kind of break to rest, even a short one, and getting into therapy (if you‚Äôre not already). Hope this helps a little, and I really empathise with you and hope things get better üíï",8,yourfavambo,"I see you, and I feel you. High-functioning anxiety can be a total nightmare, especially when it feels like you're putting on a mask for the world while secretly falling apart. First of all, let me just say that it's amazing you're acknowledging your struggles and reaching out for support.

One thing that might help is to start small. Instead of feeling like you need to make drastic changes, try to find tiny ways to prioritize your well-being. Maybe that's taking a few deep breaths before each meeting, or sneaking in a short walk during your lunch break. These little moments of self-care can add up and help you feel more grounded.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to face this alone. Consider talking to a therapist who can help you develop coping strategies, or confiding in a trusted friend or family member. And hey, it's okay to not be okay ‚Äì it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your mental health. You are not your job, and you are not defined by your anxiety.

First of all, let's just acknowledge that it's okay to take a day off and recharge. You mentioned you had a productive week, so you definitely earned it.

That being said, I think I can help you identify a possible culprit behind your anxiety and physical symptoms. Dehydration is a huge anxiety trigger, and it sounds like that might have played a role in your situation (one glass of water all day is a pretty low amount, even for a relaxed day). Next time you decide to take it easy, try setting a reminder to drink water at regular intervals. It might sound silly, but it can make a huge difference.

Remember that self-care is not selfish, and taking care of your physical and mental health is essential. Don't be too hard on yourself for taking a break, and try to find ways to make those 'lazy days' more nourishing for your body and mind.""","

My advice would be to take things slow and prioritize your well-being. You might want to consider talking to a counselor or therapist on campus to help you navigate any anxiety or panic attacks that might come up. Also, don't be too hard on yourself - it's normal to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to ask for help. You've got this, and you're not alone.""","

I've been there too, and it's like you're anticipating every possible reaction, both positive and negative. It's exhausting, and it can be really hard to silence that inner critic.

One thing that might help is to remind yourself that people are more likely to respond to your intention, not your perceived tone or level of knowledge. If you're genuinely trying to contribute or connect with others, that's what will shine through.

Also, consider the 5-second rule: write and post it within 5 seconds, before your brain has a chance to overthink it. It's not about being reckless, but about trusting yourself and your instincts.

Lastly, it might be helpful to reframe your thinking around 'giving off the wrong impression.' Instead of focusing on what others might think, try to focus on what you're trying to communicate. Your thoughts and opinions are valid, and it's okay to share them, even if they're not perfect.

You're not alone in this, and it's great that you're recognizing this pattern. Keep working on it, and don't be too hard on yourself!","

It's great that you've talked to your doctor and ruled out any major health issues, but it's understandable that you're still looking for answers.

I think it's possible that your high anxiety levels over the past year could be contributing to this feeling. Sometimes, our bodies can take time to adjust after a prolonged period of stress, and it's not uncommon for people to experience physical symptoms like dizziness or fatigue after an anxiety episode.

One thing you might want to try is keeping a journal or log to track when you feel dizzy, and see if you can identify any patterns or triggers. This might help you better understand what's going on and whether there are any specific situations or activities that make it worse. Also, have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor about your anxiety and how it's affecting your daily life? They may be able to offer some additional guidance and support.","

As for today, I would suggest taking things one step at a time. You don't have to tackle the whole day at once. Why not start by getting ready for class, and then see how you feel? Sometimes, getting into a routine can help ground you and give you a sense of control. If you're feeling too anxious to go to class, it's okay to reach out to your professor or a trusted friend for support.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to not be okay. Take care of yourself today, and don't be too hard on yourself if you need to take a step back.","

For example yesterday my friends didn't sit with me at lunch. My head thought the worst, ""they probably hate me,"" ""they're embarrassed to sit with me"", ""they're fed up with the negativity you give off"" I made myself feel sick and couldn't finish my lunch.
My friend later messaged me saying she didn't see me at lunch and thought was I wasn't in the office, but no, I just sat slightly out of view. They just didn't see me.

It's like your mind is running wild with worst-case scenarios, and before you know it, you're emotionally invested in these hypothetical situations.

First off, just know that you're not alone in this. Many people do this, and it's not uncommon for our brains to go down this path. It's like our minds are trying to prepare us for potential outcomes, but in the process, we can get caught up in the emotional fallout.

One thing that might help is to try and catch yourself when you're starting to spin out into these negative scenarios. Take a step back, breathe, and remind yourself that it's just your mind playing out hypotheticals. Try to focus on the present moment and what's actually happening, rather than getting caught up in what-ifs.

It's also worth exploring some mindfulness or CBT techniques to help manage these thoughts and emotions. Remember that you're not your thoughts, and you don't have to let them dictate how you feel. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.","

I hope u/throwawayhelpson99 don't remember that shit I did that time!""",65,Dr_BeefCake,"I completely get it, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's like your brain is constantly replaying the cringe moments on repeat, and you can't seem to escape. I've been there too, and it's absolutely draining.

Here's the thing: those memories and feelings aren't going to magically disappear, but you can learn to reframe them. Instead of beating yourself up over past cringe, try to see it as a natural part of growth and learning. Everyone has embarrassing moments, and it's okay to laugh at yourself.

When those thoughts pop up, acknowledge them, but don't let them consume you. Try to focus on the present moment and what you're doing right now. If you're doing a hobby, immerse yourself in it; if you're relaxing, focus on your breath. It's not easy, but with time and practice, you can learn to manage those thoughts and reduce their impact.

Remember, your worth isn't defined by those memories. You're more than your past mistakes, and you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of.","

It's natural to feel anxious and wonder what you'd do in a situation like that. I think it's a sign that you care deeply about your safety and the safety of those around you.

Firstly, please know that your anxiety is valid, and it's okay to feel scared. It's essential to acknowledge those feelings and not suppress them. If you feel comfortable, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your anxiety. They can provide you with coping strategies and support.

In terms of what you can do, there are some organizations working towards stricter gun control laws and promoting gun safety. You can look into volunteering or donating to these organizations. Every small action counts, and it can help you feel more in control of the situation.

Lastly, please don't let the fear of something terrible happening stop you from living your life or considering starting a family. You deserve to live a happy and fulfilling life, and there are many people and communities working towards creating a safer and more compassionate world.","

oxcy43,Anxiety,This is going to sound stupid but...,doometteowo," I pumped my own gas for the first time in my life yesterday. I'm an adult and have been on the road for years, I would always get someone to pump my gas for me. I know that sounds dumb but it really scared me. I always thought everyone would look at me and I would mess it up or spontaneously combust into flames (ridiculous I know). I cannot stand being in a line or somewhere that draws attention and I *hate* feeling eyes on me. 

 When I shared my victory with my husband he called me sheltered so obviously he doesn't understand. It was terrifying to exit my vehicle and stand there while I could feel people watching me, they would know if I fucked up. I didn't fuck up, it was incredibly easy. From now on I'm only pumping my own gas to avoid being in a lineup of people and talking to a cashier.",795,92,1628024781,Sounds like you made amazing progress and found out you enjoy the outcome.

Social anxiety can be overwhelming, and it's amazing that you faced your fear and pumped your own gas for the first time. It's not about being 'sheltered,' but about being honest with yourself about what makes you uncomfortable. Your husband might not understand, but that's okay ‚Äì you do, and that's what matters.

It's awesome that you found it to be an easy process, and now you can avoid those anxiety-inducing situations at the gas station. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and do what makes you feel comfortable. Don't let anyone make you feel like you're not capable or that your fears are irrational. You're not alone in this, and there are plenty of people who understand what you're going through. Keep celebrating those small victories, and don't be afraid to share them with people who will support and encourage you.","

Absolutely love it.,818,68,1559913599,Are you... me?,104,[deleted],"I am you and what I see is me.

I can never attend a vacation or event I look forward to without the worry and anxiety of getting a cold. 9/10 times I don‚Äôt get a cold but even worse I get ‚Äúanxiety sick‚Äù that lasts days; chills/sweats, irritable, insomnia, no appetite etc. 

Luckily I‚Äôve acknowledged this with a therapist and don‚Äôt necessarily feel alone like I used to. 

Jah blessüôèüèº",7,lifeboy91,"I feel you on this one. It's like our brains are experts at creating this vicious cycle of guilt, anxiety, and inaction. First of all, let me just say that it's okay to take a break and prioritize rest when you're feeling mentally exhausted. It's not selfish, it's necessary.

That being said, I've found that sometimes the smallest, most manageable steps can be a great way to break this cycle. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to go for a 5-mile run, try setting a goal to simply take a 5-minute walk outside. Or do a few jumping jacks during commercial breaks while you're watching your favorite show. It's not about pushing yourself to exhaustion, but about finding tiny moments of movement that feel achievable.

And hey, if you're not feeling it, that's okay too. Just acknowledge the anxiety and remind yourself that it's not based in reality. You're not going to get every illness ever from taking a day off. Take care of yourself, and try to be kind to your brain. It's doing the best it can, even if it's being a bit dramatic sometimes.","

As soon as they saw that they completely shifted and asked if I needed any resources for them and were wanting to get an emergency crisis officer out there to talk with me and get me help.

It's completely understandable to have an anxiety attack in a situation like that - the uncertainty and feeling of being in a vulnerable position can be really overwhelming.

It's amazing that the officers were so understanding and willing to help once you explained your situation. It's a great reminder that not everyone in law enforcement is out to get us, and that there are many kind and caring people in those roles.

Remember that it's okay to ask for help, and it's great that you're already seeking support for your anxiety and depression. Don't underestimate the value of having a good support system - it can make all the difference in managing your mental health.

Keep taking care of yourself, and try not to be too hard on yourself about the anxiety attack. It's not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign that you're taking care of yourself and acknowledging your needs.","

If that makes any sense.",327,alicecooperunicorn,,0,,"I totally get why that would be infuriating. It's like people are trying to one-up each other on who's the most anxious, without actually understanding what it's like to live with anxiety.

First of all, I just want to acknowledge that having an anxiety attack during math (or any situation, really) is absolutely terrifying. It's not something to be taken lightly or used as a way to seem cool. I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this.

Here's the thing: you're not alone. There are people who genuinely struggle with anxiety, and it's not something to be ashamed of. If you're feeling overwhelmed, try talking to a trusted teacher, counselor, or even a classmate who might be going through something similar. Having a support system can make a huge difference.

Also, remember that just because someone claims to have anxiety doesn't mean they're ""cooler"" than you. Your experiences and feelings are valid, regardless of what others are going through. Keep being you and don't let others minimize your struggles.","

mwjaet,Anxiety,anxiety wastes SOO much time,throwawaysnowski,"I've always been and anxious person, but this past year my anxiety and depression got so much worse.

And now almost a year later, its still there, intrusive thoughts, always overthinking. Honestly for the last year, i don't think there was a single time I was truly at peace, just sitting on the couch and relaxing. Its literally either me being anxious/depressed or me doing my best to distract myself from my thoughts.

And i've just realized how much time i've wasted. I look back this past year. and i dont think about memories i've made, fun i've had, or accomplishments, its just my anxiety taking up all my mental space. And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted. And even now, as i realize how much i've lost from this, I still can't stop my brain from being so worked up. Its so anoying",846,38,1619138786,"I feel this so deeply.

But there‚Äôs also lots and lots of great memories. I really appreciate my anxiety free days, even more then before!

Maybe time for you to change what you are doing. New meds maybe? Therapy, or a different kind of therapy or therapist if you‚Äôre already doing it. Learn some new coping skills. It‚Äôs not easy, but I think sometimes we just need shaken up a bit to get out of the funk!

First of all, please be kind to yourself. Recognizing how much time you've lost to anxiety is a huge step, and it takes a lot of courage to confront that. Don't beat yourself up over it, though - instead, try to use that awareness as a catalyst for change.

One thing that might help is to start small. Instead of trying to tackle your anxiety and depression all at once, try breaking it down into manageable bits. Maybe that means committing to 10 minutes of relaxation or learning something new each day. It's not about making massive progress right away; it's about taking tiny steps towards a more balanced life.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to support you. If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to a therapist or trusted friend/family member for help. You got this, and you can start reclaiming your time and energy.","

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

I have anxiety and mild depression as well, I get to where it feels like days turn into months. I feel like I can't get outside of my own head sometimes. I often wondered if there is even a way to do that honestly. Like right now, I love going to my Dr. I know that sounds weird, but I feel safe and comfortable there.

It just feels like days are turning into months and I am thinking this is something to do with my mild depression. 

I am starting work here soon, thinking that might calm some of it down. I was just wondering what you did to get out of the thought loop, because that feels like what I am going through.

Your experience with quitting drinking and seeing a significant reduction in symptoms is really inspiring. It's amazing how often our mental health is intertwined with our physical habits, and it's great that you've found something that works for you.

For anyone reading this who might be struggling, I think it's really important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It's okay to ask for support, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. If you're feeling overwhelmed, try reaching out to a hotline or talking to a trusted friend or family member.

gpr8c6,Anxiety,Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day,FallUpJV,"For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.

You might already know that anxiety is caused by our fight/flight reflex, aka how our body protects itself from a threat. The main point is that its purely an animalistic response left over from when we were apes - upon seeing a bear, our bodies give us a hit of adrenaline which causes higher heart rate, breathing fast, shaking, to gives us more strength to run away or fight.

You probably felt embarrassed, and thats a hard emotion to deal with as humans, it can be isolating and we are very much pack animals, no matter how introverted someone is, because for our ape ancestors, embarrassment is our response to being isolated or ganged up on.

It can be really tough to shake off the feeling of being aggressed, especially when it's unexpected. It sounds like you're still carrying around some social anxiety baggage, and that's totally understandable.

Firstly, try to practice some self-compassion - it's not your fault that someone else chose to react aggressively. You can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to it. When you start ruminating on the incident, try to reframe it in a more neutral light. Ask yourself, ""What would I say to a friend in this situation?"" or ""What would I do if someone else was in my shoes?""

It might also help to develop some emotional grounding techniques, like deep breathing or physical activity, to help calm your nerves when you start feeling anxious.

POST TITLE: Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day

POST BODY: For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.
Thanks for reading !

edit : I definitely need to check the titles for mistakes too

hf4z51,Anxiety,"DAE get ""emotional build-up"" over time because of anxiety and the only solution is to cry it out?",[deleted],"I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for 19 years now. Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety. Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

‚Äê----------------------------------

EDIT: I'm really glad we all kind of took the opportunity to bond over something so stressful. It makes me happy that the anxiousness I felt yesterday opened the floor for us to talk candidly about what we experience. I hope everyone feels like they're not alone. I hope we all get to feeling better, or at least discovering new, healthy ways of coping with things. ‚ù§",795,86,1593018826,i do that too. i may not even notice the emotional build-up until i cry my eyes out. but its always refreshing.,73,darkywitch,,0,,"I totally get it, and I'm so glad you shared this. I've been there too - the anxiety build-up, the emotional breakdown, and the desperate need to just release it all through tears. It's like your body and mind are screaming, ""Enough! Let it out already!""

First of all, let me just say that you're not alone in this. It's amazing how many people experience this same thing, and it's great that you're creating a space for us to talk about it honestly.

One thing that might help is to try and catch those emotions as they're building up, rather than letting them accumulate for months. Have you tried journaling or talking to someone (even if it's just a trusted friend or family member) about how you're feeling? Sometimes just acknowledging and sharing those emotions can help release some of that pressure.

But I also totally get the need for a good, cathartic cry. Sometimes, that's just what we need - no explanations, no judgments, just a safe space to let it all out. You do you, friend.","

e45wza,Anxiety,Does anyone else shut down when being yelled at?,ChewTommy,"(M24) Whenever my mom is in a bad mood or pissed at someone or something. I feel like as if I have to walk on eggshells around her. If I take too long to do something or do it wrong she yells at me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love my mother to pieces but when she‚Äôs yelling at me my mind kind of shuts off, I can‚Äôt even think of a response and even if I do it never comes out right. I start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100. 

Then I get the usual thoughts of being useless, a failure etc. The rest of the day I feel like absolute garbage and I accomplish nothing other than laying in my bed. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Have you found a way to deal with it and not feel like trash?",805,76,1575157962,"This happened to me a lot, but that‚Äôs because I  grew up with a dad who has anger issues, so anytime someone yelled or argued with me I would be filled with anxiety and fear and spend the rest of the time thinking how everything is my fault and how much I hated myself. 

I still feel like this at times but i just distract myself with video games or something until I calm down and collect my thoughts. I reflect on what happened and the other person‚Äôs perspective and that usually clears the depressive thoughts away especially if I go back and have a conversation with that person.",121,twoluna,,0,,"Hey OP, I totally get it. I've been in similar situations with my own family members, and it can be really tough to navigate. It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed and shut down when faced with yelling or intense criticism. It's like your brain's 'fight or flight' response kicks in, and you just freeze.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this. It's not about being 'useless' or a 'failure' ‚Äì it's about how you're wired to respond to stress and anxiety. One thing that helped me is practicing self-compassion and reminding myself that I'm doing the best I can. When you start to feel anxious or shut down, take a deep breath and try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of beating yourself up, try to focus on the fact that you're doing okay, and that it's okay to make mistakes.

If you feel comfortable, try having an open conversation with your mom about how her yelling affects you. It might help her understand your perspective and find alternative ways to communicate. Remember, you deserve respect and kindness ‚Äì both from others and yourself.","

9panel,Anxiety,Finally talked to my professors about my anxiety and holy shit why didn't I do this before?,not-weed,"I have this weird fear that if I tell people I have panic attacks they're going to think I'm using that as an excuse. I finally got over that fear today! I have a low C in one of my classes, and the professor seemed like a total asshole. I kept getting low grades and was too afraid to say anything. I finally told her today that I was having a rough time and that my panic attacks have been getting more severe. She totally dropped her \~very formal doctor \~ voice and asked what she could do to help. I literally almost started crying. She said to give me a ""thumbs down"" if i wasn't feeling well and that I could step out of class at anytime. 

My math teacher did the same thing, telling me she doesn't want me worrying over her class, that even she knew it was a ""BS class"". I'm still suprised at how well everything went wow.",826,55,1539878920,"Good! Professors usually want their students to do well, and mental illness can present a real and serious barrier to that. 

The first semester I started dealing with panic disorder was a train wreck. The final for one course was a bunch of essay questions, I had barely been to that class all semester and had an F in the class. I didn‚Äôt even know what to write down in the answer book, so it turned in to a long written explanation of why I hadn‚Äôt been to class and what was happening. I never saw the professor again after that final was turned in and I took a few years off of school to get myself together. But when I went to check grades(didn‚Äôt really need to since I knew I failed everything) I saw that somehow I had gotten a C in his class. ",187,buttw0rm,"Same thing happened to me in high school few years back. I used to be late or skip classes all together, then one day the teacher confronted me in front of the whole class. Later I felt so pressured that I just explained to him the truth in private. It just so happens people are PEOPLE. Haha, despite all the negativity on the internet, most folks are willing to extend a helping hand or show high levels of empathy when they see someone is truly struggling.

BTW, if you're in college/univeristy try to get formal accommodations. It's just a good way to track all of it, because not all professors will react with the same level of kindness. Also when it comes to job searching you have a paper trail to explain any sort of bad grades or whatever! Good luck!  ",13,[deleted],"""Huge props to you for finally opening up to your professors about your anxiety. I totally get why you were hesitant - the fear of being judged or seen as 'making excuses' is real. But it sounds like you were pleasantly surprised by their responses, and that's amazing.

It's a great reminder that most people, especially those in positions of authority, are more understanding than we give them credit for. They want to help, and they often have resources and accommodations that can make a huge difference.

Don't be too hard on yourself for not speaking up sooner - the fact that you did it now is what matters. And it's awesome that you're taking steps to prioritize your mental health. Remember that it's okay to ask for help, and don't be afraid to reach out to your professors or a counselor if you need support. You're not alone in this, and it sounds like you're on the right path.

I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until my mid-20s that I realized it was more than just 'being a worrier.' Like you, looking back, I can identify moments from childhood where anxiety was definitely present ‚Äì the excessive worrying about school, the fear of not making friends, the constant need for reassurance from my parents.

It's amazing how therapy can help us connect the dots and understand our experiences better. I think recognizing the patterns and origins of our anxiety can be incredibly empowering. It's not just about 'dealing with it,' but about understanding why it started and how it's shaped us.

I'm glad you're on this journey of self-discovery, and I'm sending you lots of support. Remember, it's okay to take your time and work through your emotions. You're not alone in this, and it's amazing that you're taking proactive steps to manage your anxiety.

ci7u59,Anxiety,Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?,TryLink,"I'm a bit of a history buff, and I made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently.

One thing that's helped me cope is to focus on the resilience and kindness of people, too. For every terrible thing that happens, there are countless stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things to help others. It's easy to overlook those stories, but they're out there.

It might also be helpful to take breaks from the news and documentaries when you're feeling overwhelmed. Give yourself permission to step away and do something that brings you joy. And don't underestimate the power of talking to someone about how you're feeling ‚Äì whether it's a friend, family member, or even a therapist.

You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and creating a space for us to talk about this.","

First of all, take a deep breath and remind yourself that your friends are coming to hang out with you, not to judge your house or your parenting skills. They're probably just as excited to see you as you are to see them!

As for the cleaning and toddler worries, try to focus on the things that you can control, and let go of the rest. Your house is likely cleaner than you think, and your toddler will probably be just fine (and if not, your friends will likely be understanding and sympathetic).

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, but try not to let it get the best of you. Take a few minutes to collect yourself before they arrive, and focus on enjoying the time with your friends. You've got this!","

kaxb4t,Anxiety,I used to think this was bullshit and I'm sorry to anyone that has this.,Catman666muneyman,"Just got back from the hospital (No insurance, this should help my anxiety.)  I used to be a competitive martial artist, I was in the army, grew up homeless yada yada yada.  Whenever I heard someone say they had crippling anxiety I would just think they were weak, I would literally just assume it was them making an excuse for being lazy or something close to it.

Today my chest started burning out of no where, then suddenly my heart was beating so hard that I could physically see my shirt move from it.  I felt like I needed fresh air so I stood up but then my hands got super sweaty and I immediately felt like death itself was standing right next to me.

I rushed to the hospital thinking I had severe covid or pneumonia or something but they said it's likely anxiety.  Now after much research, it does seem like it's likely anxiety.  I just feel bad now knowing there's people out there so mentally strained that they're physically breaking down...  How do you guys cope?  This is all new to me, I can't even sleep because I know these medical bills are going to take years to pay off.  Is there anything you guys do to sleep?

Sorry if this post is sporadic, I guess I'm just rambling at this point but it just blows my mind how physically painful anxiety can actually be.  I feel like it's something that should be talked about in school at the very least.",737,143,1607667493,"Medication, therapy, and meditation all help me.

I used to be in a similar mindset, thinking people with anxiety were just being dramatic, but then I went through some tough stuff and it hit me like a ton of bricks.

First off, let me tell you that it's amazing you're acknowledging your previous ignorance and apologizing for it. That takes a lot of courage. As for coping mechanisms, I've found that mindfulness exercises, deep breathing, and physical activity can really help calm my anxiety. But everyone's different, so it's all about finding what works for you.

One thing that might help with sleep is writing down your worries before bed, and then leaving them on the paper. It sounds silly, but it can help clear your mind. Also, have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor? They can help you develop strategies to manage your anxiety, and some even offer sliding scale fees or free consultations.

POST TITLE: I used to think this was bullshit and I'm sorry to anyone that has this.

POST BODY: Just got back from the hospital (No insurance, this should help my anxiety.)  I used to be a competitive martial artist, I was in the army, grew up homeless yada yada yada.  Whenever I heard someone say they had crippling anxiety I would just think they were weak, I would literally just assume it was them making an excuse for being lazy or something close to it.

Today my chest started burning out of no where, then suddenly my heart was beating so hard that I could physically see my shirt move from it.  I felt like I needed fresh air so I stood up but then my hands got super sweaty and I immediately felt like death itself was standing right next to me.

I rushed to the hospital thinking I had severe covid or pneumonia or something but they said it's likely anxiety.  Now after much research, it does seem like it's likely anxiety.  I just feel bad now knowing there's people out there so mentally strained that they're physically breaking down...  How do you guys cope?  This is all new to me, I can't even sleep because I know these medical bills are going to take years to pay off.  Is there anything you guys do to sleep?

Sorry if this post is sporadic, I guess I'm just rambling at this point but it just blows my mind how physically painful anxiety can actually be.  I feel like it's something that should be talked about in school at the very least.

It's amazing you've made it this far, and I want you to know that your strength and resilience are something to be proud of. 

I think it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to feel exhausted and fed up. In fact, it's a sign that you're human and need to take a step back to recharge. When we're dealing with mental health struggles, it's easy to lose sight of our own needs and boundaries.

If I may suggest, take some time for yourself, even if it's just a few minutes a day. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy, whether that's reading, taking a walk, or practicing mindfulness. Reach out to loved ones, friends, or a therapist for support ‚Äì you don't have to do this alone. And when all else fails, remind yourself that tomorrow is a new day, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not alone in this, and there are people who care about you deeply.

If you don't have someone nearby to give you a physical hug, I'm sending you a big virtual one instead. Imagine someone wrapping their arms around you, holding you tight, and telling you that everything is going to be okay. You're strong, you're capable, and you've made it through tough days before.

Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and don't be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or a professional if you need someone to talk to. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep going, and know that better days are ahead.","

I think it's also important to recognize that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel lost and alone sometimes. But you're right, we are not alone. There are people out there who care about us, who see our worth and value.

What I think people are trying to say is that they understand anxiety can be a normal response to stress, but it's not the same as living with an anxiety disorder. It's like the difference between having a headache and living with chronic pain.

For those who are supportive but don't fully understand, I think it's helpful to educate them on the differences between anxiety and an anxiety disorder. But for those who are dismissive or unsupportive, it's okay to set boundaries and surround yourself with people who do get it.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and your experience is valid. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and seek out support when you need it.","

n0n5fq,Anxiety,Why do people do this?,SnapesSocks,"I got made fun of today. I‚Äôm 42 years old and I got made fun of today. I was trying to get windshield wiper fluid on my way home with my very rambunctious and distracting 5 year old. I stood at the wrong register, because no one told me where I was being rung up and my kiddo was talking to me non stop. (For reference, the cash registers are only 2 feet away from each other.) When I saw that the total on the register in front of me was $3, I realized that wasn‚Äôt right and immediately turned to the other register that said $9 and paid that cashier. It was that simple. And I was so upbeat and friendly to them, outgoing even. On my way out the door with my kiddo, I overheard one cashier tell the other that I ‚Äúmust be stupid how could I not have noticed...‚Äù etc. the door closed. 

I‚Äôve got my anxiety mostly under control at this point in my life but it‚Äôs been a long battle. Something like this...guaranteed they‚Äôve already forgotten it, but it‚Äôs going to stick with me and rattle around in my brain, and make it harder for me the next time I need to go out and do something. And I also know that that‚Äôs all on me. 

But it would have taken nothing for her to say nothing or at least to wait until the door closed behind me. The way she did it was so offhand and uncharitable. Why do people do that?",777,100,1619639355,"in my experience working in service jobs, there‚Äôs a tendency to expect customers to act as if they are as familiar with the space as are the employees who work there every day. employees make fun of customers for minor misunderstandings and faux pas that are actually perfectly understandable. even knowing that, it‚Äôs hard not to take it personally, though. i‚Äôm sorry you had that experience.",389,user6733688544,"Honest answer: It's more about her than you.

I'm a lot more chilled out and compassionate now at age 36 than I was between the ages of puberty-23. For me age played into it, but some people never grow past it.

I already had a lot of issues, but my anger issues were the worst back then. When I worked a register it only took one bad customer for my mood to switch from feeling indifference towards customers into annoyance with or even sheer hatred for all of them, no matter how nice or friendly they might be. I hated my job. (Bad customer = screaming, yelling, doing everything in their power to ruin your day kind of bad.)

Though that kind of talk was reserved for the breakroom. I kept a professional customer service smile and attitude anywhere customers could hear, but I also have an explanation for why she didn't wait.

Sometimes it wasn't even about being aggravated or mad. Sometimes it was just a toxic form of bonding with my coworkers. They all complained about or mocked customers, so I did too. That's practically what the breakroom was for. She was apparently in rush to engage in that kind of bonding. I saw it happen more than once during my retail years.

It's terrible behavior, but it really does say more about her than you. She's an angry, bitter person who probably hates her job. You just had the misfortune of encountering her. Everyone gets distracted and makes simple mistakes sometimes. Her poor perspective on life doesn't mean anything bad about you. Please remember that.",122,TerminologyLacking,"I'm so sorry to hear that happened to you. It's completely understandable that you'd be shaken up by it, especially given your history with anxiety. It's amazing that you're recognizing that their hurtful comment isn't a reflection of your worth, but rather their own shortcomings.

One thing that might help you let this go is to try to see it from a different perspective - that cashier's comment was likely a reflection of their own stress, boredom, or fatigue, rather than an actual assessment of your intelligence or abilities. People often lash out or make thoughtless comments when they're feeling overwhelmed or under pressure.

It's also worth remembering that you handled the situation with kindness and poise, despite the chaos of having a rambunctious 5-year-old in tow. That takes a lot of skill and patience, and you should be proud of yourself for that.

Try not to let their thoughtless comment define your day or weigh on your mind. You are so much more than that moment, and you deserve kindness and compassion - especially from yourself.","

I think it's a great example of exposure therapy, where you're gradually exposing yourself to the thing that triggers your anxiety (in this case, the restaurant). By doing it on your own, you're also building confidence and self-reliance.

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and to celebrate small victories.

I don‚Äôt really know what to make of it. She is a pretty well known psychiatrist with an MD and decades of experience. She patiently listened to me and prescribed me the meds that would help me battle anxiety and ADHD. She seemed really kind and compassionate, and the fact that she cried listening to my story made me realize how bad my situation really is.

It's clear that your doctor is someone who truly cares about her patients, and the fact that she was moved to tears is a testament to her compassion.

It's interesting that you mention feeling embarrassed about crying in front of her, but honestly, it's a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable, especially when it comes to our emotions. Don't be too hard on yourself about that - it's okay to show emotions, even as a guy.

As for your experience, I can relate to a certain extent. I've had my share of tough conversations with therapists, and it's never easy. But I will say that it's moments like these that can be incredibly healing. It sounds like you're in good hands with your doctor, and I hope you continue to make progress with her help.

Anyone else?",792,81,1548432404,"I literally don't answer my phone, period, unless I'm expecting a call. If there was an emergency and someone called me, I wouldn't answer until I got a text explaining the situation. Or if I recognise the number I might text them and ask what's up. Phone calls are bad enough, but phone calls out of the blue, I can't handle. So my phone is on silent 24/7. My phone is used much more as an alarm, map, workout tracker, and portable device, than for calls/texts to begin with. 

Texts are much better though. I can take the time to formulate a reply, and also if someone isn't available to answer, you can tell them what you wanted to say in the mean time, allowing them to answer later rather than having to call you back etc. ",78,JesusGreen,"Yup. I can't even respond to my friends nowadays. It has killed my social life and I don't know how to make it better. I just hate the idea of being on the hook for a conversation, call or text.

For me, it's like my brain is immediately wired to think ""this could be bad news"" or ""I'm in trouble"" the moment my phone buzzes. It's like my mind is trying to prepare for the worst-case scenario, even if it's just a friend texting to hang out.

One thing that's helped me is taking a deep breath before checking my phone. It sounds silly, but it gives me a second to calm down and remind myself that 99% of the time, it's something completely harmless. I also try to set specific times to check my phone, so I'm not constantly on edge waiting for notifications.

It might also be worth exploring why you think you're feeling this anxiety. Is it related to a specific event or person? Identifying the root cause could help you address it and make it more manageable.

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel anxious. Remember that it's just a phone, and it's not controlling your life.","

l4lsgt,Anxiety,It‚Äôs time for me to leave this sub &lt;3,Le_Great_Buffalo,"Long time lurker here! I‚Äôve just finished therapy and I‚Äôm officially ‚Äúcured‚Äù of my anxiety! Even though it might come back some day, I now know how to handle it and get through it again and again. 

Lurking in this sub has helped me cope with a lot of my insecurities and has helped me realise that i am not alone. So thank you all for that! 

To all of you, I also want to say that there is a way out of anxiety. You can get better, no matter which road you choose to do it through and it is definitely wort it! I really hope for you all that you will keep on fighting and come through all of your struggles. No matter if you think them small or overwhelming, struggle is a struggle, so keep on fighting that devil! 

Some advise from my therapist (psychiatrist) that might help some if you (it helped me a lot!) is to realise that worrying wont solve anything.

POST TITLE: It‚Äôs time for me to leave this sub &lt;3

POST BODY: Long time lurker here! I‚Äôve just finished therapy and I‚Äôm officially ‚Äúcured‚Äù of my anxiety! Even though it might come back some day, I now know how to handle it and get through it again and again. 

Lurking in this sub has helped me cope with a lot of my insecurities and has helped me realise that i am not alone. So thank you all for that! 

To all of you, I also want to say that there is a way out of anxiety. You can get better, no matter which road you choose to do it through and it is definitely wort it! I really hope for you all that you will keep on fighting and come through all of your struggles. No matter if you think them small or overwhelming, struggle is a struggle, so keep on fighting that devil! 

Some advise from my therapist (psychiatrist) that might help some if you (it helped me a lot!) is to realise that worrying wont solve anything. Not that you should be able to control when your brain starts to worry, but if it starts, then don‚Äôt give it as much attention (i used to worry about everything and it drained all of energy). A point my therapist also made was that if two persons got in an accident, one who worries about such accident and one who doesn‚Äôt, the one who worries won‚Äôt be any more prepared than the one who don‚Äôt worry.

they have 0 history of hiv or stis/stds for the matter (according to them). and have had only had one partner. they hadn't been offically tested however.

should i be worried?

should i still reach out to my doctor?

They‚Äôve only had the one partner (I‚Äôm assuming you meant prior to yourself) and stds don‚Äôt transmit through saliva (even if gums were bleeding I still think it unlikely, I am certainly no expert tho)

However, if it is making you this anxious, it might be worth getting checked for your piece of mind if nothing else. Best of luck",65,Pasame20,"I totally get why you're freaking out, and I'm glad you're reaching out for help. First, let's put things into perspective: the risk of HIV transmission through oral sex is already low, and the fact that your friend doesn't have a history of HIV or STIs (contrary to what they've told you, I know) reduces that risk even further.

That being said, it's great that you're taking proactive steps and considering talking to a doctor. I would encourage you to do so, not just to discuss HIV testing, but also to address your anxiety and OCD. A healthcare professional can offer you guidance, reassurance, and potentially connect you with resources to manage your anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to be cautious and take care of your health, but don't let fear consume you. You're not being irrational or crazy; you're just being human. Take this as an opportunity to prioritize your mental health and learn how to navigate these situations in the future. You've got this, and there are people here to support you.","

One thing that might help is to practice self-compassion and challenge those negative thoughts. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that you don't have to be perfect. When it comes to decision-making, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable choices. Instead of planning your whole day, start with one small decision, like what to eat for breakfast. Celebrate those tiny victories, and gradually build up your confidence.

It's also essential to acknowledge your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. You went to Paris and China alone? That's incredible! Don't let anxiety take away your sense of pride and achievement. You are capable, and you deserve to live a life filled with joy and excitement.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience increased anxiety after drinking, especially if they're not used to it. It's possible that your body is just reacting to the sudden change.

It's also important to acknowledge that you've overcome suicidal thoughts in the past, and that's something to be incredibly proud of. You've shown strength and resilience before, and you can do it again.

In terms of managing your anxiety, have you considered reaching out to a therapist or support group? Talking to someone who understands can make a huge difference. Additionally, there are many online resources and hotlines available that can provide you with immediate support.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. There are people who care about you and want to help. If you're feeling overwhelmed, please don't hesitate to reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741741.","

It sounds like you're dealing with a classic case of anticipatory anxiety. I've been there too, and it can be really tough to break the cycle of overthinking.

One thing that helped me is to practice ""what if"" reframing. When I catch myself spiraling into worst-case scenarios, I challenge myself to come up with ""what if"" scenarios that are equally unlikely but positive. It sounds silly, but it can actually help to balance out your thinking and make you realize that there are just as many potential good outcomes as bad ones.

Another thing you might try is to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Instead of getting caught up in hypothetical scenarios, try to bring your attention back to what's happening right now. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can be really helpful for this.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to have anxious thoughts ‚Äì they don't define your reality. You are not your thoughts, and you have the power to choose how you respond to them. Keep working at it, and don't be too hard on yourself. You got this!","

9kgj4s,Anxiety,Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.,Irarhet,"Every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control.

First off, acknowledging that it's been a while since you've had to deal with those thoughts is a huge step. You're right to take solace in the fact that you caught it before things escalated. 

One thing that might help right now is to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about the bigger picture of happiness/contentment. Sometimes, breaking it down into smaller, manageable bits can make things feel less overwhelming. Take a few deep breaths, and ask yourself: what can I do right now, in this moment, to take care of myself? It might be as simple as making a cup of tea or taking a short walk. 

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to still feel anxious after a panic attack. Just keep moving forward, one small step at a time.","

It might also be helpful to have a conversation about what you need from him when you're feeling anxious. Does he know how to support you?

When you feel these energies, which are overwhelming, observe them and let them pass as if you are detached from them and don't judge yourself for feeling this way because we all have (and are) feeling similar emotions  right now!!

I hate to sound like a clich√© but things really will get better. And you're not middle-aged yet ;)

I'm 47m and got divorced a year ago and now I have an amazing girlfriend and it was pretty unexpected that we got together.

Hope you feel better soon.",56,FukudaSan007,"I can only imagine how tough this must be for you. Quarantine can be isolating, and when you're already feeling uncertain about your life, it can be a real struggle. First of all, let me just say that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people are going through similar emotions right now.

It might sound simple, but I want to remind you that your worth and attractiveness aren't defined by your age or physical appearance. You have so much more to offer than that. It's okay to feel like you've lost time, but try not to focus on what could've been. Instead, think about what you can do now to move forward.

Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist if you need someone to talk to. Even if it's just a phone call or a video chat, human connection can make a big difference. Take care of yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and try to focus on the present moment. You're not broken, and you're definitely not alone. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a small step at a time.","

POST TITLE: The covid crisis and quarantine is devastating to my mental health

POST BODY: After week 4 of quarantine alone, I'm not half the man I was before. I'm broken and feel hopeless about the future. 

I'm turning 34 in July, single, gay and basically feel old as fuck. Feel like my life is not over but that I've lost the best years of my life. Soon I'll just be a undesirable unattractive middle aged man. Who will want me?  

The sense of despair I'm feeling is really profound and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

I hate this.

r5w754,Anxiety,Does anyone else hide in the bathroom when overstimulated at work or school?,lavenderxmoonxlight,"Whenever I feel burnt out socially or overstimulated I hide in the bathroom to try to feel less overwhelmed. I usually sit in the stall quietly for ten to fifteen minutes (either during my lunch break, or when I have some free time).

I'm wondering if I'm the only one who does this",786,83,1638303077,"Every break and lunchtime, I hide in my car and chainsmoke and stuff my face. Surely this is not a healthy coping mechanism, but it's coping, I guess.",99,Far_Emphasis_546,,0,,"I totally get it, and I'm glad you shared this. I'm sure you're not the only one who's ever felt the need to escape to the bathroom for some quiet time. I've been there too - the constant social interactions, noise, and expectations can be overwhelming.

First of all, let me just say that it's okay to take a break and prioritize your own well-being. It's not selfish; it's necessary. If hiding in the bathroom for a bit helps you recharge, then that's what you should do. 

That being said, have you considered talking to someone about how you're feeling? A trusted friend, family member, or even a mental health professional might be able to offer some valuable insights or coping strategies. Additionally, you might want to explore some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, that you can use in the moment when you start feeling overwhelmed. Remember, taking care of yourself is important, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.","

n9nzjp,Anxiety,I battled my anxiety and got the Covid vaccine!,iheartrevolution,"I've spent most of the last 14 months inside, and my preexisting anxiety has gotten more intense. I've also had a previous anaphylactic reaction to a food allergy and most of my anxiety attacks have been regarding having a reaction to new foods or foods that are similar to what I know I am allergic to. Because of this, I have been extremely nervous about  getting vaccinated. I knew it was the right thing to do, and the way that the world gets better. I trust science and understand the facts that there's much more risk in long term Covid effects than negative effects from the vaccine. However, hearing allergic reactions to the vaccine being discussed and knowing that it's one of the issues they look out and prepare for has triggered my anxiety and made me afraid for when it was my turn.

I put it off much longer than I should have, but today I finally faced the fear and got through it. My experience was so positive. I found a local Buddhist university and knew that was the location I was meant to get it at. Everything went right, from the beginning. The parking attendant allowed us to pull right up and get the shot in our car even though the location recently went from drive through to walk up. The man taking my information heard about my allergies and got closer to me than I've been to another person in over a year and looked me right in the eyes and told me ""Hey, you're going to be alright."" He told me a story about why he is vulnerable and reassured me he was vaccinated and everything had gone smoothly for him and would for me as well. The nurse who stayed with me after was awesome and we spent the 30 minute wait talking about all the things I get to look forward to about entering the world again.

That gentleman looking me in the eyes and not just reassuring me, but in a way commanding me, to know I would be okay meant the world to me.

I am done and I am so relieved. It's been 5 hours and I feel great. Proud of myself for getting through it and being a part of what will heal the world.",798,71,1620704353,Omg I get my first dose on Thursday I hope I‚Äôm as strong as you are!!,42,Avondran,Omg I get my first dose on Thursday I hope I‚Äôm as strong as you are!!,42,Avondran,"""Huge congratulations to you for facing your fears and getting vaccinated. I can only imagine how daunting it must have been for you, given your history of anxiety and anaphylactic reactions. It's amazing that you found a location that felt safe and supportive for you - the Buddhist university sounds like a great choice.

That gentleman's kindness and reassurance must have made a huge difference for you. Sometimes, all it takes is someone to look us in the eye and tell us we're going to be okay. It's a powerful reminder that we're not alone in our struggles.

Your story is a great reminder that it's okay to take things at our own pace and to prioritize our own comfort and safety. Don't be too hard on yourself for putting it off - you did it when you were ready, and that's something to be proud of. Wishing you all the best as you start to re-enter the world - you got this!""","

I've struggled with similar noise anxiety in the past, and it can be really debilitating. For me, it was a mix of not wanting to annoy others and also being super self-conscious about being the center of attention.

One thing that's helped me is to remind myself that, honestly, most people are way too caught up in their own lives to notice (or care) about the noise I'm making. And if they do notice, they're probably not judging me as harshly as I think they are. It's also helped me to set boundaries with myself ‚Äì like, if I'm at home alone, I let myself make noise without worrying about it. And if I'm with others, I try to communicate with them about my noise anxiety so we can find a compromise.

It might also be worth exploring where this anxiety is coming from ‚Äì is it rooted in past experiences or something deeper? Talking to a therapist or trusted friend/family member might help you work through some of these feelings. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.","

I've been there too, and it's frustrating when it feels like it's not enough.

One thing that helped me was incorporating mindfulness practices, like meditation and deep breathing exercises, into my daily routine. It's not about completely eliminating anxiety, but more about learning to live with it and respond to it in a healthier way. I also found it helpful to set small, achievable goals for myself each day - it gives you a sense of control and accomplishment, which can be really powerful in managing anxiety.

Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to not be okay. You're already taking huge steps by seeking therapy and taking care of yourself, so be kind to yourself and celebrate those tiny victories.

They hear phrases like: it will go away, why are you  anxious, how can you solve this, you are dramatic etc etc

My parents do this as well. They think anxiety can be solved somehow, like when one has a migraine and they take something for it and it goes away. They look at me confused and perplexed while I explain them some of the symptoms. 

How come boomers are not familiar with this, even in the least?",674,194,1662310461,Because it's what most of them where taught and it was reinforced by their parents and our society as a whole.

Mental health issues have been stigmatized for a long time and we are just recently pushing for them to be normalized and to normalize the support that people need,547,scarpenter42,"My mom understands anxiety due to me having it and her finally realizing she has am anxious personality.

It's frustrating and invalidating when our loved ones don't understand what we're going through.

I think a big part of the issue is that mental health education and awareness have improved significantly over the past few decades. Boomers grew up in a time when mental health was stigmatized and often not discussed openly. Anxiety, depression, and other conditions were seen as personal weaknesses rather than legitimate health issues.

It's also possible that your parents are coming from a place of love and concern, but they just don't know how to help. They might think that if you can just ""solve"" the problem, the anxiety will go away.

One thing that might help is to have a calm, patient conversation with your parents about what you're experiencing. Try to use ""I"" statements to describe your feelings and avoid blaming or accusing language. You could also share some resources or articles about anxiety to help them understand better. Remember that it's okay if they don't get it right away ‚Äì it's a process, and it might take time for them to learn and understand.","

k2vm53,Anxiety,Finally mustered up the courage and applied to grad school!,wrxcurls,"I graduated from undergrad about 5 years ago and never got a job in my field. I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn‚Äôt understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist. I finally did something that scared me, and even if it doesn't work out, at least now I can say that I tried and I gave it my all.

6r1abv,Anxiety,Does really bad weather soothe anyone else's anxiety?,IamConer,"For a very long time now any time there's a bad storm or something, it makes my anxiety go down so much. To the point I like to put on storm sounds when I sleep at night. I really don't get it, I was deathly afraid of storms when I was a kid. But I check the weather all the time to see when it's going to storm. I sleep better and even feel better and more energized all day. I hope I'm not alone.",763,103,1501641920,"I would be so happy to have a storm, rain, clouds, SOMETHING. It has been nonstop sunshine for nearly two months and it's driving me bonkers. I don't know why. ",125,seaoflanterns,"I would be so happy to have a storm, rain, clouds, SOMETHING. It has been nonstop sunshine for nearly two months and it's driving me bonkers. I don't know why. ",125,seaoflanterns,"I totally get what you're saying. I've experienced something similar with rain and thunderstorms. I think there are a few possible reasons why bad weather might be soothing for people with anxiety. One possibility is the idea of ""closure"" - when there's a storm outside, it creates a sense of containment, like the whole world is curled up and waiting for the storm to pass. It can also be a great distraction from our racing thoughts.

Another theory is that the constant, repetitive sounds of the storm can be really calming, almost like white noise. It's like our brains can finally relax and focus on something external instead of our internal worries.

I'm glad you've found something that helps you sleep better and feel more energized! If you don't mind me asking, have you tried exploring other calming sounds or environments, like ocean waves or forest sounds? It might be worth experimenting to see if you can find other things that help you relax.

You're definitely not alone in this, and I'm happy to hear that you've found something that works for you.","

n94dce,Anxiety,I made 2 phone calls this morning!,ToastedTwinkles,"I used to have very severe phone anxiety to the point i would have an anxiety attack and either never make the call, or take 2 hours to calm down enough to do it. This morning I made 2 back to back calls regarding topics that stress me out the most (dental and financials) and I feel like I handled them really well! One of the calls even lasted a half hour. It still makes me anxious and I'm sweating a bit but I'm really proud of myself. For anyone else who also struggles with this, you can do it! Just take small steps. I would suggest starting with easy short phone calls such as calling a family member or asking what a store's hours are. Good luck.

Im afraid to apply for jobs :/ that‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm struggling with right now.,37,Jaded_Discussion_703,"""Huge congratulations on making those calls and pushing past your phone anxiety. It's amazing how far you've come, and it's clear that you're taking actionable steps to overcome this challenge. I can imagine how daunting it must feel to tackle topics like dental and financials, but you're proof that it's possible to build confidence.

Your advice about starting small is spot on. Breaking down the task into manageable steps can really help build momentum. I'd also suggest being kind to yourself when you do feel anxious or overwhelmed - it's okay to take a step back and breathe. Remember, progress over perfection.

It's also great that you're acknowledging your feelings and taking care of yourself after these calls. That's just as important as making the calls themselves. You got this, and you're an inspiration to others who may be struggling with similar anxieties. Keep taking it one call at a time, and remember to celebrate your wins (even the small ones, like booking that vet appointment).""","

What if you make a mistake? Then what? A single mistake will not be the end of your life, career, or that job.

",0,kroatia04,"Hey OP, I completely get it. That anxiety wall can be overwhelming, especially when it's tied to the pressures of work.

First of all, kudos to you for starting Zoloft again - that takes a lot of courage. It's great that you're taking proactive steps to manage your anxiety.

One thing that might help is to try to reframe your thinking around tomorrow. Instead of focusing on what could go wrong, try to think about what you're looking forward to or what you're proud of accomplishing. It's also helpful to remind yourself that you've gotten through tough days before and you can do it again.

Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to not have all the answers right now. You're not alone in this, and it's amazing that you're sharing your struggles and being so honest with yourself. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time. You got this.","

Firstly, just want to acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's normal to feel triggered or anxious when we're exposed to intense or confrontational conversations.

One thing that might help is to take a step back and remind yourself that you can't control the outcome of a debate or the future of the country. What you can control is how you respond to it and take care of yourself in the process. 

Try to focus on the things that you can influence, like staying informed, having respectful conversations with others, and advocating for the causes you care about. And don't forget to prioritize your own self-care and mental health - take breaks from the news, practice relaxation techniques, and surround yourself with people who support you.

You're not alone in this feeling, and there are many others who are feeling the same way. Hang in there, and remember that every small action counts.","

stbidb,Anxiety,Anyone else in the vicious cycle of procrastination/do-nothing &gt; hate yourself &gt; repeat cycle?,medquestion80,"I've suffered from some form of depression for the last 10-20 years. (I'm early 40's now).

I'm really struggling to break out of this cycle:

1. Feel behind where I think I should be in life career/success wise and hate myself for it
2. Attempt to start making some change by studying or job hunting, but immediately shut down and end up doing nothing and sleeping or finding a distraction instead. In the past this shutdown was just more self-hatred and numbness, but now I'd say that when I attempt to make change I start to feel more anxiety about it (maybe a 4/10 surge?) that pushes me away.
3. Repeat for years on end and now it's really bad.

I've tried taking smaller steps, but that hasn't worked well. In general I've had a total feeling of malaise/anhedonia, but over time now I feel more anxiety about this as I'm feeling the time pressure. In particular the time pressure is horrifying to me because I'm still single and want kids, hate my career, and haven't bought a home yet and this market is beyond stupid.

Any particular practices help getting you moving forward?

I've been in similar cycles, and it's like being stuck in quicksand - the more you struggle, the more you sink.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone, and it's not your fault. Depression and anxiety can be incredibly debilitating. It's great that you're recognizing the patterns and seeking help.

One thing that might help is to focus on tiny, almost ridiculously small steps. Instead of ""I need to change my entire career,"" try ""I'll spend 10 minutes today researching a new field."" Celebrate those tiny wins, and use them as momentum to build upon.

In terms of meds, I'm not a doctor, but I've heard that medications like Wellbutrin or Adderall can help with motivation and focus. However, it's essential to consult a professional to find the right treatment for you.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. You're not a failure for being in this cycle. You're human, and you're doing the best you can. Keep pushing forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time. You got this.","

Just take things one step at a time, and be kind to yourself. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to 'feel' a certain way or to start making decisions right away. Reach out to friends, family, or a support group if you need someone to talk to - it can really help to have people around you who care.

Remember, it's okay to not be okay right now. Your mom will always be with you in spirit, and the memories you shared will stay with you forever. You're not alone in this, and we're all here for you. Sending you love and hugs during this tough time.","

One thing that might help is exploring different types of content that cater to your interests. For example, if you like learning new things, you could try educational YouTube channels or documentaries. If you're into creative pursuits, you could watch artists or crafters working on their projects.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your comfort. Not everyone needs or wants to be super social, and that's perfectly fine.

I‚Äôm so scared of getting a job but I really want to get moving forward in life. Wish me luck!!

It's completely normal to feel scared or intimidated, especially with no prior experience. But the thing is, everyone starts somewhere, and most employers understand that. They're often more interested in your willingness to learn and grow than in your past experience.

I love your attitude of 'better to try and fail than not try at all.' That's a great mindset to have, and it'll serve you well in life. Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't work out right away. Just keep applying, and don't be afraid to ask for help or advice along the way.

POST TITLE: I‚Äôve applied for two jobs!!

POST BODY: I just wanted to share some good news. I‚Äôve always been terrified of getting a job, but I‚Äôm trying my best to be brave. I‚Äôve applied for a job at a grocery store, and I just applied for a job at a doggy daycare. I feel like because I don‚Äôt have any past experience it‚Äôs going to be really hard to get a job but I‚Äôm going to just apply anyway. Better to try and to fail, than to not try at all. I‚Äôm so scared of getting a job but I really want to get moving forward in life. Wish me luck!! 

Edit: ahhhhh thank you all for your support I‚Äôm so happy and excited!!! I‚Äôll probably post when I get a job!! Time to make me some money!!

8o3hls,Anxiety,I did it!! I left my house for the day and had fun!,NosyGurl,"Today was a really really good day, I left my house for like 11 hours!!! I got past my anxiety and just smiled through the day. I'm sitting on my couch right now after a long day away from home and I feel so calm and sort of relieved. I feel happy, happy that this day was actually really good. My god I almost never leave my house and when I do my head turns into chaos but today it was just calmness. I'm so so surprised. Most of all I'm proud of myself :D I feel great!!!",805,57,1527972534,"That's awesome man! It's great when days are super good, especially when it's doing things that make you anxious. I hope you continue to have more good days (‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢)",49,IdiotKuma,"That's awesome man! It's great when days are super good, especially when it's doing things that make you anxious. I hope you continue to have more good days (‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢)",49,IdiotKuma,"""Huge congrats on pushing past your anxiety and having a great day out. It's amazing how sometimes, taking that first step can make all the difference. I can totally relate to the feeling of chaos that often comes with leaving the comfort of home, but it sounds like you really broke through that barrier today.

I think it's awesome that you're acknowledging and celebrating your accomplishment - that's a huge part of the process. Don't downplay the significance of what you've done; it's clear that it wasn't easy, but you did it anyway.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's okay if not every day is like today. Anxiety can be unpredictable, and it's normal for it to ebb and flow. But what you've shown yourself today is that you're capable of managing it and having a great time despite it.

Keep building on this momentum, and don't be too hard on yourself when things don't go as smoothly. You got this, and you should be proud of yourself!""","

You're doing awesome if you're tackling something similar!!! You got this, I'm rooting for you :) there are good times ahead!",11,sabina-77,"""Huge congrats on conquering the thousand steps at Laguna Beach. I can only imagine how daunting that must have been for someone with height anxiety. It's amazing that you were able to push through and not only make it to the top but also feel the joy of skipping back to your car.

It's great to hear that your medication is working for you and that you're taking care of yourself. Remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace and celebrate small victories along the way. Your progress might not always be linear, but it's clear that you're making strides.

Keep in mind that it's not just about the physical accomplishments, but also about the mental and emotional growth. You're proving to yourself that you're capable of overcoming fears and anxieties, and that's incredibly empowering. Keep pushing forward and be kind to yourself when things get tough. You're doing great!""","

z4klkv,Anxiety,Tell me your most bizarre symptoms of anxiety,justjane7,"I genuinely cannot believe how powerful the brain can be, I have had things that I was sure meant that there was something very wrong with me and the professionals told me it‚Äôs just anxiety. Curious to know what some of these have been for all of you!",326,535,1669401348,"Chronic nausea w/o being actively anxious. Oh and moments of derealization/depersonalization that make me feel so inexplicably scared that I self-harm (bite, scratch myself) so I can ‚Äúsnap‚Äù out of it.",407,kuromi616,"I just constantly feel scattered brain, brain fog, zombie brain, inability to think and process clearly.. like I‚Äôm not all there and sorta dissociation? Is this anxiety or add? I would love to get some Clarity. These all came about 2 yrs ago when I quit dip. I was a habitual user of dip and chew for 10 yrs ( 1 can a day).",20,Zealousideal-Fly-452,"I completely get where you're coming from - it's both fascinating and frustrating how anxiety can manifest in so many weird and wonderful ways. For me, one of the most bizarre symptoms was experiencing 'foreign accent syndrome' - I'd suddenly start speaking with a different accent, completely out of the blue. It was only when I started seeing a therapist that I realized it was my brain's way of coping with stress.

It's wild how our brains can create these physical and emotional sensations, and it's great that you're acknowledging the power of anxiety. Remember, you're not alone in this - it's more common than you think, and there's always support available. Don't be afraid to reach out to professionals or online communities (like this one!) when you need help.

It's also important to note that just because it's 'just anxiety' doesn't mean it's any less valid. Your feelings and experiences are real, and it's okay to take the time to work through them. Keep talking, and remember to be kind to yourself.","

acbd0s,Anxiety,Aced a phone interview and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,Queenbach,"Three years ago you would‚Äôve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I‚Äôd either pass the phone to my family, or I‚Äôd be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I‚Äôd blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn‚Äôt even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They‚Äôd be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could‚Äôve said better, the ways I could‚Äôve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn‚Äôt write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I‚Äôm hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I‚Äôm here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!",829,32,1546556147,Good job on the interview! Here's a upvote to celebrate,25,SomtimesDepressed,"I feel you. I had to call gamefly today to fix my account, it looked like my heart was about to grow legs and hop out. ",13,Shattered_Persona,"I just wanted to say huge congratulations on acing your phone interview and for sharing your inspiring story. I can completely relate to the feeling of being paralyzed by phone anxiety - it's amazing that you've come so far and are now helping others by sharing your experience.

I love that you took it step by step and didn't be too hard on yourself when you made mistakes. It's so important to acknowledge and celebrate our small wins, even if it's just making a phone call to book a doctor's appointment. Your approach is a great reminder that overcoming anxiety is a process and that it's okay to take things at our own pace.

Your offer to help others practice phone calls is incredibly kind and generous - I'm sure there are many people who would appreciate that support. Keep spreading the positivity and good vibes - you're doing amazing, and I have no doubt you'll nail your in-person interview too!","

eq8lgh,Anxiety,I'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things,waterpanne,"You think I choose to feel this way? ""Just don't worry about it"" wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. Amazing advice, thanks.


I have some really bad fears that I can't get over and I am just at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore",778,83,1579304624,As if anxiety is a choice.,133,[deleted],"It sucks to hear people say that, but hey, it's a good gesture. Not everyone can sit down and explain exactly why your rationale isnt how you should be thinking about things. People most of the time understand that you won't stop worrying about things. As a person with hella anxiety, I tell people to not worry about things. Not cuz I think it'll stop their worrying, but because I know that it really is reassuring

Edit: reworded a sentence",25,method_mayo,"I completely get where you're coming from. It's frustrating when people minimize your feelings with simplistic advice. The truth is, anxiety and fear are complex emotions that can't just be switched off.

Firstly, please know that you're not alone in this struggle. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your fears. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.

Rather than trying to suppress your fears, have you considered exploring them? Sometimes, understanding the root cause of our fears can help us address them more effectively. You might consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your feelings.

Additionally, there are many anxiety-reducing techniques that might be helpful, such as mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling. These can help you cope with your fears in a more manageable way.

Remember, you don't have to face this alone. There are people who care about you and want to help. Keep seeking support, and don't give up on finding a way to manage your fears.","
