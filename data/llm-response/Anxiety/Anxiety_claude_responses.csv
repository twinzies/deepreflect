I keep promising myself to switch over to green tea, which has less caffeine, but I love the taste of coffee too much.",262,toasterpoodle,"I keep quitting coffee because of the anxiety it causes then think, why did I quit coffee? Coffee is the best! Try it again with the same consequences.",1,r3dl3opard,"Oh man, I feel this in my soul. That anxiety-depression-caffeine loop is brutal - it's like being stuck in a hamster wheel you can't get off of. I struggled with this exact cycle for years.

What helped me break it was gradually switching to half-caf in the mornings, then eventually green tea. The L-theanine in green tea actually helps take the edge off anxiety while still giving you a bit of energy. It's not a perfect solution, but it helped me step down from that caffeine dependency.

For the sleep anxiety, have you tried any bedtime routines? Even something simple like 10 minutes of breathing exercises or listening to rain sounds can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. It took me a while to find what worked, but establishing that routine really helped break the cycle.

Just remember you're not alone in this. Mental health stuff is complicated and it's okay to take small steps toward finding what works for you. Sending support your way! üíú","

That peaceful late-night solitude hits different - it's like the world finally stops demanding things from you and you can just *be*. No expectations, no responsibilities, just existing in your own space.

But I've learned the hard way that while those quiet moments are valuable, consistently pushing off tomorrow by staying up late usually makes everything harder in the long run. The next day still comes, except now you're exhausted and less equipped to handle it.

Maybe try carving out some deliberate ""just existing"" time earlier in your day? Even 30 minutes of intentional quiet time in the evening can give you that same peaceful feeling without the sleep debt. Or make your bedroom a calm sanctuary where you can decompress while still getting rest.

Those feelings of wanting to pause time and avoid tomorrow are super valid. But remember - you deserve to experience life fully rested and present, not just in those stolen late-night moments. Be gentle with yourself, but try not to let the peace of 3am come at the expense of your tomorrow-self.","

As someone who struggled with attendance anxiety in college, I wish more professors had explicitly stated this. I used to get caught in this spiral where missing one class would make me anxious about returning, so I'd miss more, making it even harder to go back.

For any students reading this: Your professors are right - just send that email and go back. I promise the anxiety you're feeling about returning is way worse than the actual experience will be. Most students and professors won't even notice you were gone, and those who do are usually just glad to see you back.

And if you're dealing with ongoing issues affecting your attendance, most universities have resources to help - whether that's counseling services, academic advisors, or disability support services. Don't wait until things get worse to reach out. Your education matters, and there are people who want to help you succeed.","

While screaming into the void (or Reddit) can actually be pretty cathartic, here are a few things that help me when I'm in full AAAAAAHHH mode:
- Deep breathing (I know, I know, everyone says this - but 4-7-8 breaths actually help)
- Going for a walk while listening to music that matches your energy
- Squeezing an ice cube or taking a cold shower to ""reset"" your system
- Writing it all out (which you're already doing - good job!)

Remember that anxiety peaks don't last forever, even though they feel endless in the moment. You're not alone in this, and it's completely okay to not be okay sometimes.

n0y195,Anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,SendBoobPics4ADollar,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&amp;#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",3269,147,1619676000,The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,1235,bruhmomentnumber46,The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,1235,bruhmomentnumber46,"You handled this situation perfectly and with incredible empathy. As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how terrifying it can be to have a panic attack, let alone while being responsible for someone else's safety. The fact that you gave him space, validated his experience, and removed any time pressure probably made a huge difference in helping him recover.

One small suggestion for others who might encounter something similar - it can also be helpful to remind someone having a panic attack that what they're experiencing will pass. Sometimes during an attack, it feels like it will last forever.

Props to the driver too for recognizing he needed to pull over rather than trying to push through it. That was the responsible thing to do. And offering your number as a support contact was such a kind gesture.

This is a great example of how showing basic human compassion during someone's vulnerable moment can make a real difference. Thanks for sharing this story.","

It's like having a hyperactive internal critic that never takes a day off. I've learned that while these traits are common with high-functioning anxiety, they don't have to control your life.

Something that's helped me is the ""future self"" exercise - when I'm obsessing over a mistake or worrying about worst-case scenarios, I ask myself ""Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?"" Usually, the answer is no, which helps put things in perspective.

For the people-pleasing, I started practicing saying ""no"" to small things first. It's uncomfortable at first, but it gets easier. And you know what? Most people respect boundaries way more than we expect.

Remember that being high-functioning doesn't mean you have to handle everything alone. It's okay to talk to a therapist or trusted friend about these feelings. Your anxiety might make you think you're not doing enough, but I bet you're doing better than you give yourself credit for. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Pro tip for others with similar anxiety: Google Maps usually has menu photos uploaded by customers, even if the restaurant doesn't have their own website. Just click on the photos section and search ""menu"" - you can often find recent pictures of both the menu and actual dishes.

And for real, it's not just about anxiety - it's practical! You can:
- Check prices beforehand to budget
- Look up unfamiliar ingredients or dishes
- Figure out dietary restrictions
- Compare options with friends before going
- Have a backup order ready if your first choice isn't available

Restaurants that keep their online menus updated and accurate are the real MVPs. It's 2024 - this should be standard practice everywhere!","

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that.

I spent years minimizing my own struggles because I kept comparing them to what other people were going through, thinking ""well at least I don't have it as bad as them."" But your therapist is absolutely right - if something affects you deeply, it IS a big deal, full stop.

It's amazing how such a simple statement can completely shift your perspective. Your feelings and experiences are valid simply because you're experiencing them. You don't need anyone else's permission or approval to acknowledge that something is impacting your life.

I'm really glad you found a therapist who gets this and communicates it so clearly. That kind of validation in a therapeutic relationship is so important, especially when you're just starting out. Keep holding onto this insight - it's a powerful tool for self-compassion and healing.

At any given moment, the physical mechanisms of your brain are using about a quarter of the resources carried to it by blood (air, water, nutrients). When thinking hard, you can use up to 50%. That's half of all your blood and resources just for the brain, and half for the rest of the whole body. If overthinking is exhausting you, it's literally because you are exhausting your resources with your brain. There's nothing imaginary about it.",421,Kwakigra,"I like that, really interesting way to look at it.  Thanks for sharing!",11,pickindim_kmet,"That's actually a brilliant analogy! As someone who also deals with anxiety, it really helps visualize how our mental state can drain our physical energy. Anxiety keeps our minds constantly ""running in the background"" - just like apps that drain our phone battery even when we're not actively using them.

Something that helped me was learning to identify my anxiety triggers and practicing ""closing those background apps"" through mindfulness and grounding techniques. Even small things like taking 5 deep breaths or doing a quick body scan can help reduce that constant drain.

It's also important to remember that just like a phone needs regular recharging, we need to actively make time for rest and recovery. Don't feel guilty about needing to ""plug in"" and recharge - it's not laziness, it's necessary maintenance for your mental health.

Thanks for sharing this perspective. It's a really helpful way to understand and explain why anxiety can be so physically exhausting.","

I used to do this all the time until I realized I was just making myself more anxious and tired the next day, which made work even harder. What helped me was setting aside 30 minutes of genuine relaxation time right after work - no chores, no responsibilities, just doing whatever I want. It scratches that same itch but without sacrificing sleep.

Maybe try giving yourself that intentional downtime earlier in the day? That way you're not trying to steal time back at night when you're already exhausted. Your future self will thank you for the extra sleep, even if your current self wants to rebel against bedtime!","

Nothing intense - just a few small things like prepping my clothes/lunch for Monday, taking a relaxing shower, and having a cup of tea while watching something light. It gives my brain something concrete to focus on besides work stress.

Also, try to be gentle with yourself. Even if you ""wasted"" the day, beating yourself up about it only makes the anxiety worse.

I love how you're using this time creatively too - baking, stretching, reading. It's a great reminder that while we can't control the situation, we can control how we respond to it.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about the work anxiety? It was a game-changer for me. In the meantime, try to create small things to look forward to during your workday - maybe a coffee break with a coworker you like, or a quick walk outside at lunch. Having mini-checkpoints helped me stop viewing the entire day as just something to endure.

For the evenings, instead of going straight to bed, maybe start with just one small activity you enjoy - even if it's just 30 minutes of reading or a hobby. It helps reclaim some of that time for yourself rather than letting anxiety win the whole day.

You've already taken the first step by recognizing this pattern and wanting to change it. That's huge. Your life is worth more than just counting down the hours, and it's okay to take small steps toward making it better.","

I get the racing heart and sweating too, and sometimes after a particularly anxious day, I feel like I've run a marathon even though I've just been sitting at my desk.

Something that helped me understand this better was learning that anxiety triggers our fight-or-flight response, flooding our body with stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. No wonder we feel exhausted afterward - our body is literally preparing for survival mode! It's like having your emergency systems running at full blast for hours.

Have you tried any grounding techniques? Deep breathing exercises or the 5-4-3-2-1 method (naming things you can see, touch, hear, etc.) can help calm your nervous system when you're in those situations. Also, don't feel guilty about needing recovery time after anxiety-heavy events. Your body is working overtime during these episodes, and that rest is just as valid as recovering from physical exercise.

What you're describing sounds a lot like social anxiety, specifically something called ""post-event processing"" where your mind replays social interactions looking for mistakes. I deal with this too and it can be really exhausting.

Something that helps me is reminding myself that most people are way too focused on their own lives/concerns to be analyzing my behavior as intensely as I think they are. Also, if someone is genuinely upset, they'll usually tell you directly or show clear signs - not leave you guessing.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can teach you specific techniques to manage these thoughts when they pop up. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is particularly good for this kind of anxiety.

In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. The fact that you care so much about not hurting others actually shows what a considerate person you are. Your friends and family clearly value you - trust their actions and words over that anxious voice in your head.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?

POST BODY: Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don‚Äôt have a bad relationship with any of them. I don‚Äôt consider myself anti social. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they‚Äôll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don‚Äôt want to be a broken record either. I‚Äôm sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I‚Äôm not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you‚Äôre not alone brings you some relief as well. And I‚Äôm nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I‚Äôm here.

Sending my support to you guys and I hope the world can eventually treat you better without being gaslit &lt;3",2377,123,1620396626,"I think a lot of people just don't understand what anxiety/depression actually looks like and get overwhelmed when faced with it. I try not to blame them because it's something society doesn't talk about much and can be a lot. 

When someone exhibits ""normal"" levels of stress/worry/sadness it's easy to alleviate that person's pain with support and kind words and encouragement. Plus, there's usually a light at the end of the tunnel, an end point. Someone saying they are having anxiety over a presentation at work presents it and then the stress is done. That's what a lot of people think anxiety means both because we use that word flippantly and because its what people talk about when referring to ""anxiety"". (Please know I'm not saying these people don't have anxiety or can't feel overwhelmed, I am not gatekeeping the term, just that it's harmful when we use that term in only one way). 

Then here comes someone who says they are having anxiety and are in the bathroom for an hour, having trouble breathing, can't eat, can't get out of bed. And people are like whoa whoa whoa, this isn't anxiety, this has got to be some way worse mental health issue! Especially if it keeps happening!

I guess what I'm trying to say in a very long winded way is that we have turned the words 'anxiety' and 'depression' into meaning 'stressed' and 'sad'. People can deal with those emotions, there's a definitive end to those feelings. Most don't know what to do with someone having prolonged anxiety attacks. Which is why we need to more openly discuss mental health so more of us can be informed.",234,Kiwikow,"Literally at my workplace, this happened:

All-staff meeting: HR gives presentation on wellness and taking care of your health.

Later that same day: HR messages me to scold me about a few hours of sick leave.",10,stayonthecloud,"This is painfully accurate. Companies love to talk about mental health awareness when it makes them look good, but the moment someone actually needs accommodation or understanding, suddenly it's an ""HR issue"" or ""performance problem.""

I've learned that the best approach is to formally document everything and know your rights. If you're in the US, anxiety can qualify as a disability under the ADA, which means you're entitled to reasonable accommodations. Get everything in writing, keep a paper trail of your requests and their responses, and consider working with a mental health professional who can formally document your needs.

That said, I also recognize that fighting this battle while managing anxiety is exhausting. It's okay to look for a more supportive workplace if your current one isn't serving you. Some companies genuinely do walk the walk when it comes to mental health support.

You're not alone in this frustration, and you're not ""unprofessional"" for having a human response to stress. The system needs to change, not you.","

I love your point about focusing on the end goal rather than getting overwhelmed by the process. That's such solid advice. Sometimes we can paralyze ourselves by thinking about ALL the steps at once, when really we just need to tackle one thing at a time.

You should be really proud of yourself - not just for making the change, but for pushing through all that fear and anxiety to make it happen. It takes real courage to completely reshape your life like that.

Here's what helps me: Instead of viewing anxiety as ""wasted time,"" try to reframe it as part of your journey. Those moments when you're struggling aren't failures - they're battles you're fighting, and surviving them takes real strength. Every day you push through anxiety is a victory, not a waste.

Something that really changed my perspective was realizing that ""living life to the fullest"" doesn't mean being happy 24/7. It means experiencing the full range of human emotions, including the difficult ones, and continuing to move forward despite them.

Start with tiny wins. Maybe today you just took a walk despite feeling anxious, or reached out to a friend when you wanted to isolate. Those small moments matter. They're not lost time - they're proof of your resilience.

Having dealt with panic attacks myself, there's nothing more dismissive than someone suggesting you can just ""think happy thoughts"" when your body is literally betraying you for no logical reason.

While well-meaning people try to help with quick fixes, they often don't understand that anxiety disorders are legitimate medical conditions - not just everyday worries that can be reasoned away. Your brain and body are essentially misfiring alarm signals without cause.

One thing that helped me was explaining to friends/family that sometimes I just need them to listen and validate what I'm going through, rather than try to solve it. And when I'm having an attack, simply having someone sit quietly with me (if I want company) or give me space (if I need it) is more helpful than any motivational quote.

Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.",rubertidom,"Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat.

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me.",2294,87,1589995065,"This is so spot on for me. I have severe anxiety and I struggle with the simplest of tasks. Mopping the floor can take me a month because I‚Äôll put it off til the next morning. Then the evening. Rinse repeat.

I can put off shopping until my cupboards are bare and sometimes go through withdrawal because I can‚Äôt do something as simple as refill a repeat prescription.

An interaction on one of my posts today had me realise that the more I ruminate over tasks, the more daunting they become. 

One of the household chores I never seem to struggle with for example, has always been the dishes. Because it‚Äôs never been something I‚Äôve put on my mental to do list. I tend to wash a couple of dishes while I‚Äôm waiting for the kettle to boil or waiting for the microwave to ping etc etc and they just get done. 

But mopping the floor becomes an impossible task because I overthink it. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just mop the floor. I‚Äôve gotta sweep first. Then I have to pick up all the stuff on the floor. Then I‚Äôve gotta make up the bucket etc etc etc. Oh and there‚Äôs no point having a clean floor if the stove is dirty. So I have to clean that first and then the wall tiles are gonna look weird if the floor is all shiny. So I‚Äôll have to clean those too... then the windows will need doing. Eh. There‚Äôs no time for all that now‚Äù then I‚Äôve made it into a whole thing. 

Stupid example, but that‚Äôs pretty much how I approach everything in life and I‚Äôm just sat here on my arse doing nothing with my life at 32 because making a phone call is too hard",134,s4few0rd,Goodness. I wish it was that easy,4,Fosad,"This is such great advice! I've struggled with anxiety for years and can confirm this approach really works. The longer I put something off, the more my mind builds it into this huge, scary monster that's way worse than reality.

I started using the ""eat the frog"" technique (doing the hardest thing first) and it's been a game-changer. Those anxiety-inducing emails or phone calls I used to dodge? Now I tackle them first thing in the morning when my energy is highest. Sure, I still get nervous, but it's so much better than carrying that dread around all day.

One small tip I'd add: Sometimes breaking down that scary task into smaller steps helps make it less overwhelming. Maybe you don't need to solve the whole problem right away - just take that first small step. Even just opening the document or dialing the first few numbers of that phone call counts as progress.

Thanks for sharing this - it's a really powerful reminder that avoiding our fears only makes them stronger. Time to face those frogs! üê∏","

It's completely normal to feel shaky and overwhelmed afterward - that's your body processing the adrenaline surge that comes with doing something that scares you. The fact that you're crying now is also a natural release of that tension.

What you did matters. That man will remember your kindness, and you'll remember that you're capable of being brave when it counts. Each time we push through our fears to help others, it gets a little easier.

jubv7z,Anxiety,There are people out there who don't have anxiety,AKLJW1122,"Isn't it just such a wild thought that there are people out there who just live their lives? They're not constantly worrying or feeling overwhelmed. They don't have panic attacks. They're able to do whatever they feel like doing! Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.

I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a ""normal"" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.

EDIT: I was not expecting this much of a response from everyone, I am very surprised! I am a little overwhelmed by all the comments, so I'm sorry if I don't respond to you but I am reading them! Thank you so much everyone. You are all lovely people, wishing you all the best!",2104,248,1605397453,"Yeah, this is my boyfriend essentially.

I'm convinced I could have been anything if I didn't have this anxiety holding me back and this crippling fear that I'm just not good enough,170,Niki-Nicole,"I totally get this feeling. It's like watching people casually do things that feel impossible to us and wondering if they're superheroes or something. But here's something I've learned through therapy - even people without clinical anxiety still experience worry and fear sometimes. The difference is more in the intensity and frequency.

Something that helped me shift my perspective was realizing that ""fearless"" isn't really the goal. Even people who seem carefree usually have their own struggles - they've just developed better tools to manage them. And that's something we can work toward too.

I've found that treating anxiety like a skill to manage rather than a permanent prison has helped me make progress. Small steps, therapy if it's accessible, and self-compassion go a long way. Some days are still really hard, but I'm slowly learning to do things I never thought possible.

You're not alone in feeling this way. Anxiety is really tough, but it doesn't have to define your whole life forever. Sending you strength üíú","

i2jiqh,Anxiety,Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing?,xstarlesseyess,"I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!",2194,124,1596401574,"Totally get what you mean, I had/have the same issue with feeling like aaaah why am I not creating/doing useful stuff/exercising/bettering myself every minute of every day! 

I personally think it‚Äôs super common in younger folk (don‚Äôt know if that applies to you) - we‚Äôve grown up in an unstable economic situation, and we‚Äôre constantly reminded that our productivity and ability to make money define us and our futures. It‚Äôs an ingrained idea - and it‚Äôs obvious in the hustle/monetise your hobbies culture that‚Äôs so pervasive at the moment. 

That aside, being productive is great, but there are plenty of things that are equally or more valuable than being productive. Doing things you enjoy is definitely one of them! Taking time to unwind, destress, play video games, read, browse Reddit, whatever makes you happy, is a valuable and worthwhile use of your time. Is it productive? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I like to think that the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is improved mental health, relaxation, happiness - maybe not as tangible as your work days, but arguably more important. 

It‚Äôs an easy thing to accept, but hard to put into practice (from my experience, anyway). But I hope that you can work towards letting yourself have unproductive and fun days, as often as is possible - you‚Äôre only going to have one shot at life and you may as well enjoy it :)",192,wilt-ed,"Yes.

But at the same time I feel too tired to do anything.

Even ""unproductive"" things.

So I just sleep, and then feel awful about it afterwards.",41,chelledoggo,"I totally get this feeling - that nagging voice telling you you're ""wasting time"" when you're just trying to recharge. But here's the thing: rest isn't wasted time. It's absolutely necessary, especially for introverts.

Think about your phone - you wouldn't expect it to run forever without charging, right? Same goes for you. Playing video games, chilling inside, and having genuine downtime IS productive because it's maintaining your mental health and energy levels.

Maybe try reframing these moments. Instead of seeing them as ""doing nothing,"" view them as actively choosing to take care of yourself. You're not wasting time - you're investing in your wellbeing.

That said, if the anxiety is pushing you toward increased drinking/smoking to cope, it might be worth talking to someone professional about it. There's no shame in getting help to find a better balance.

Just remember: You don't need to earn your rest. Taking time to decompress is just as valid as any other weekend activity.","

That horrible feedback loop of ""I need to sleep ‚Üí but I'm anxious about not sleeping ‚Üí which makes it harder to sleep ‚Üí which makes me more anxious"" is the absolute worst. 

Something that's helped me is accepting that even if I can't fall back asleep, quiet rest is still beneficial. I try to reframe it from ""I MUST sleep right now!"" to ""I'm just going to lie here comfortably and let my body relax."" Sometimes I'll put on a really boring podcast or audiobook at low volume - it gives my anxious brain something mild to focus on instead of spiraling about sleep.

Also, might be worth talking to your doctor if this happens often. Sleep anxiety is super common and there are both behavioral techniques and medications that can help break the cycle.

lcke3m,Anxiety,Always afraid of 'getting in trouble' - anyone else?,gedmansrevenge,"I've always been nervous about 'getting in trouble' - I'm not sure I can even put words to it exactly.  As a kid it made sense, I had super strict parents, but it's followed me into my adult life.  Like at work, I'm always anxious I'm going to get 'in trouble'.  

And when I self talk that it doesn't even make sense - like who gives a fuck?  Losing my job would suck but I've never lost a job and my boss says I'm doing well.  And yet I find myself always looking over my shoulder and feeling guilt and anxiety building if anything is going wrong or if I slack off a bit after getting work done.

I wish I could shake the tendency but I just can't seem to.  Anyone else feel this?",1990,241,1612458375,Yes I constantly think I‚Äôm doing a bad job even if I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm doing a good job. I imagine my boss considering firing me and it makes me anxious. I overanalyze every interaction we have. It‚Äôs so stressful!,463,Dpdr00,"I have a large staff, and something that often catches my attention is when I want to check in with someone, first thing I often hear is ""Am I in trouble?"" Even when I've never coached or addressed something with this person ever - I have strong relationships with my staff, lots of positive feedback over the years, and still hear this.

Here's the message I've had to push the last few years to help - ""Adults don't get into trouble. Adults are held accountable for actions.""

And accountability is NOT punishment, sometimes accountability is just a n honest conversation about what happened, why and what the plan is to fix it, with no hard feelings, no malice, only a desire to encourage and growth. I used to feel like you do, and that's largely because my parents made ""getting into trouble"" A GIANT DEAL. Punishments were frankly beyond reason, and a source of trauma. Accountability is about speaking to and taking ownership of specific actions you've taken. ""messing up"" is something that mightve gotten me punished as a child, but as an adult, I am empowered to have a plan in place to fix it. 

You're not a kid (I think)  and other adults can't punish you like a child, and if they are, quit and find a place where you esteem and respect. Why? Cuz fuck em, that's why.  

My suggestion - reach out to your manager and request a weekly review or 1x1 of your performance - or even monthly biweekly, and explain that it's to make sure you have a clear understanding of performance and where you stand. This should really be a standard in offices, but it doesn't always happen. This can help you get clear understanding which should offer stability.

Anxiety is really tough and I dealt with it  in a crippling manner for the better part of 20 years.  i am very hopeful you can find relief &lt;3",17,urinaImint,"This resonates with me so much. That lingering feeling of ""getting in trouble"" is like an echo from childhood that's really hard to shake, even when logically you know you're doing fine. It's a pretty common response to growing up with strict parents - we internalize that constant state of alertness and carry it into adulthood.

What's helped me is reminding myself that I'm an adult now, and the ""authority figures"" in my life (like bosses) are just other adults doing their jobs. They're not there to punish me - they're there to collaborate and get work done. Plus, most workplace issues are just problems to solve, not moral failings that make you a ""bad"" person.

Maybe try reframing those anxious moments: instead of ""I'm going to get in trouble,"" think ""Is there a problem that needs solving?"" It takes time to rewire those thought patterns, but being aware of them is the first step. And hey, the fact that your boss says you're doing well shows that this is more about your perception than reality.

You're definitely not alone in this - it's a really common struggle for people who grew up with strict parenting.","

You're spot on about it being tied to self-esteem. When we don't value ourselves much, it's hard to believe others could value us genuinely. What helped me was realizing that people generally don't invest time in others unless they want to. Think about it - most people are pretty busy and have their own lives. If they're choosing to spend time with you, there's usually a real reason.

Try starting small - when someone pays you a compliment or wants to hang out, instead of immediately doubting it, just say ""thank you"" and accept it at face value. It feels weird at first, but it gets easier. And remember - you're probably way more critical of yourself than others are of you.

Be patient with yourself though. These thought patterns take time to change, but recognizing them is already a huge first step.","

g8v0l8,Anxiety,Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,annajac89,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing. I have a great routine now (way more balance with work/life/health than I did pre-covid) and love having more time to spend with my pets, reading &amp; contemplating. All the zoom meetings for work and maybe 1-2 virtual ‚Äúcatch ups‚Äù with friends every week are adequate for me socially. 

However when I think about how I‚Äôll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat? 

Note I‚Äôm not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù that I hated.",2001,199,1587968002,"It‚Äôs very strange to me how well I‚Äôve adapted to things. Over the past couple months I‚Äôve dropped several bad habits, some of them years old, and developed many good ones - out of necessity, mind you, but it‚Äôs been working for me. Overall, I‚Äôm in a much better headspace than I was at the start of this. 

I‚Äôm very introverted and strongly dislike my line of work, so there‚Äôs that. But my general anxiety has been much more manageable and not having to deal with the pressures of day-to-day life has been undeniably positive for me. I do miss my friends, but many of them are people I go weeks or even months without meeting with even when we‚Äôre not in quarantine.

I‚Äôm in the same boat as you - while I sincerely want covid-19 to end for the sake of the greater good, I am not ready to return to my normal life.",323,BenDanBreak,"Yes. 

Going back to work on may 11th is making me sick for several reasons.

I've been confined and working at home since march 17th. To sum up, I can't stand my collegues and hierarchy anymore. It ended in sick leave last autumn. 

So I feel better confined at home and going back to that place is disturbing me deeply already.

Moreover measures for social distancing at work have not been decided yet, but I fear the worse. There's some people who clearly doesn't care about personal space and I don't want to meet them.

School is supposed to start again on may 11th, but a majority of parents won't put their kids back and won't return to work. As a child-free woman, again i will be forced to do my collegues job in addition to mine (I'm already several months late on some subjects) and as usual, I will get no help in return only a pat on the head.

Sorry this looks like a vent, but I fear all the job I did with my therapist have been pointless.",29,Shaka38,"I totally get where you're coming from. It's completely valid to be anxious about losing this new lifestyle that's actually working better for you, while still hoping for an end to the pandemic itself.

Have you considered having an honest conversation with your employer about maintaining some work-from-home days permanently? Many companies are realizing that remote work can be just as productive, and they're becoming more open to hybrid arrangements. That 2-hour commute is no joke, and being able to eliminate it even 2-3 days a week could help preserve some of the work-life balance you've found.

The pandemic has shown a lot of us that our previous ""normal"" wasn't necessarily the best way to live. Maybe this is an opportunity to advocate for the parts of this new routine that have genuinely improved your wellbeing. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way - I've seen tons of posts from people who've discovered they're much happier with a slower-paced, more home-centered lifestyle.

Don't feel guilty about wanting to keep the positive changes you've made, even as we all hope for the pandemic to end.","

I have extremely bad driving anxiety and I have been stressing about this trip for months and today was the day. I drove 2 hours ON THE HIGHWAY!!!! I WENT LIKE 100 km/hr!!!!! and then 2 hours back (in the dark!!!) !!!!!!!

I bought myself a whole pizza when I got there and SMASHED IT BC I FUCKING DESERVED THAT SHIT hahahahah

It‚Äôs literally 1:45 am and I‚Äôm so fucking happy. If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre too scared to do something, DO IT. On the other side of fear is freedom. I feel like I just beat a boss level.

As someone who also dealt with driving anxiety, especially on highways, I know exactly how massive this accomplishment feels. That first long solo highway drive is like climbing Mount Everest - terrifying before you do it, but absolutely exhilarating once you've conquered it! 

And treating yourself to that victory pizza? Perfect celebration choice! üëè

You're so right about freedom being on the other side of fear. Each time you face these anxiety-inducing situations, they lose a little bit of their power over you. This drive wasn't just about getting from point A to point B - it was about proving to yourself that you're capable of way more than your anxiety wants you to believe.

Keep building on this momentum! Maybe next time you'll feel confident enough to try a different route or drive in different weather conditions. Each small victory makes the next challenge a little less scary.

Super proud of you, internet stranger! üéâ","

Noon: checks clock again

1pm: almost time to leave

3pm: on the road even though it is 10 minutes away, what if I hit traffic?

3:15pm: Arrival.  Sit in parking lot and wait.  Sigh.",840,mramirez7425,"I feel this so deeply. That cycle of getting overwhelmed, lashing out, and then being consumed by guilt afterwards is exhausting. It's like your anxiety hijacks your normal personality and reactions.

What's helped me is trying to recognize my ""pre-snap"" signs - like when my chest gets tight or I start feeling that buzzing overwhelmed sensation. Then I try to step away for a few minutes if possible, even if it's just to the bathroom to take some deep breaths. It doesn't always work, but it's better than it used to be.

Also, don't be too hard on yourself when it does happen. Anxiety is a legitimate medical condition affecting your nervous system - it's not a character flaw or moral failing. If you snap at someone, it's okay to circle back later when you're calmer and say ""Hey, I'm sorry about earlier. I was feeling really overwhelmed and didn't handle it well.""

Most people are more understanding than we fear they'll be. We're usually our own harshest critics.","

First of all, I'm really proud of you for making this post - I know exactly how challenging that can be when dealing with social anxiety.

Please don't apologize for the ""mess"" - your post is perfectly fine and actually very relatable for many of us who struggle with similar feelings. Each small step like this one helps build confidence, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment.

One thing that helped me with my own social anxiety was remembering that most people are way too focused on their own lives to judge our posts or actions as harshly as we judge ourselves. And the Reddit community, while not perfect, can be surprisingly supportive, especially to those making honest efforts to grow.

You did something brave today. Tomorrow, maybe you'll feel confident enough to make another post, or leave a comment. No pressure though - take it at your own pace. You've already proven to yourself that you can do it. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I deal with this too, and it can feel absolutely overwhelming in the moment.

But you know what? The fact that those memories make you cringe now is actually a sign of growth. It means you've evolved as a person and learned from those experiences. The you from today wouldn't make those same choices, and that's something to be proud of.

While it's tempting to wish we could go back and redo things, those uncomfortable experiences helped shape who you are now. They taught you valuable lessons about yourself and others. Instead of beating yourself up, try to practice self-compassion - we were all doing our best with what we knew at the time.

When those memories hit, try to remind yourself: ""That was then, this is now. I've grown from that person."" Sometimes just acknowledging the growth can help ease the anxiety a bit.

You're definitely not alone in this. It's a very human experience that many of us struggle with. Be kind to yourself - you deserve it.","

Only every time I talk to someone.",264,tontovila,"Oh yeah sure. 

Couple weeks ago I was at a backyard movie night with some local friends. I'm not a big social person, and they know it, but either way I really don't have much a problem hanging out by myself or taking a break if I need. 

Anyhow.

One of the wives starts to chit chat with me, and is like *what have you been up to lately?* and honestly, the real answer is not much, working, exercising, riding my bike, walking the dog, that sort of thing, and she's like *come on throw me a bone, you have to be up to something new*, so I'm like *oh I am, I bought a jump rope the other day, and after struggling a bit I can do a couple reps of a hundred each without fucking up. You should try it, it's fun,* and that ended the conversation.

Later, I was really wondering if maybe she felt I was implying that she needed to exercise more, and it bugged me for a solid couple days. Really though, I feel like I'm pretty good at squashing that type of feeling, and generally it's just my brain being a pain in the ass, so I'm good, but it happens.",3,Scapular_Fin,"I relate to this so much! What you're describing is often called ""social anxiety hangover"" or ""post-interaction anxiety,"" and it's way more common than you might think. I used to (and sometimes still do) lie awake at night replaying conversations and cringing at things I said or did.

Here's what helps me: Remember that people are generally focused on themselves, not analyzing your every word. Think about it - do you remember and judge every little thing your friends say? Probably not! Plus, those small awkward moments that feel huge to us usually aren't even noticed by others.

Something practical that helps me is to immediately engage in another activity after social interactions - like exercise, reading, or playing a game. It gives your brain less time to fall into that overthinking spiral.

Also, try to be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend. If your friend told you they were worried about something they said, you'd probably reassure them it's no big deal, right? Give yourself that same grace.

You're definitely not alone in this! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn‚Äôt. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but I‚Äôm almost 22 years old now‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt know if this is still a good thing.

Edit: Hey! I'm so so happy for all the support in the comments. I just wanted to say thank you to you all!

Thank you all for being so amazing!",2026,120,1615499522,I‚Äôm 28 and am still like this. When they say ‚Äúbe your own best friend‚Äù I think I took it too far LOL.,311,Toasty-Toez,You have any heavy pieces placements in your chart ?? Lol but nah I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôve read thousands of books since childhood.

It's completely normal, especially for empathetic and imaginative people. Many of us use books, shows, and daydreaming as a way to process emotions and escape from the heaviness of everyday life.

That said, it's worth paying attention to whether this is impacting your ability to engage with the real world. If you find yourself consistently choosing fantasy over real-life connections and experiences, it might be worth exploring why. Are there specific aspects of life you're avoiding? Sometimes our rich inner worlds can become a safety blanket when reality feels overwhelming.

Consider finding ways to channel your empathy and imagination into real-world activities - maybe creative writing, joining a book club, or finding friends who share your interests in shows/books. This way you're not giving up what brings you comfort, but rather creating bridges between your inner and outer worlds.

Just remember - having a vivid imagination isn't childish or wrong. It's part of who you are. The key is finding a healthy balance.","

But seriously, I've learned that anxiety is like having an overprotective (but slightly unhinged) security system in your brain. It's trying to keep you safe, but it's way too sensitive and sets off false alarms constantly. What's helped me is naming it - like ""Oh, there goes my anxiety brain doing its thing again."" It doesn't make it go away, but it helps create a tiny bit of distance between you and those spiraling thoughts.

Remember you're not alone in this - millions of us are out here googling ""normal headache vs deadly condition"" at 3 AM. And while it's frustrating, it doesn't make us broken - just human with an extra-vigilant mind.","

Happy that you went outside your comfort zone and will soon be making that bread :),24,DumbSmoke,"Congratulations, this is absolutely fantastic! üéâ As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know exactly how huge this victory is - not just getting the job, but pushing yourself to go to that interview when your brain was probably screaming at you to stay home.

And way to go on negotiating that salary bump! That's another anxiety-inducing conversation that you crushed. You're proving to yourself that you're capable of so much more than your anxiety wants you to believe.

About those first-day jitters - they're totally normal, even for people without anxiety. Remember this moment when they hit. You've already proven you can do hard things and come out successful on the other side. Each time you push through those uncomfortable feelings, it gets a little bit easier.

You should be incredibly proud of yourself. This isn't just about a new job - it's about breaking through barriers and growing as a person. Keep crushing it! üí™","

POST TITLE: [UPDATE] after almost canceling a job interview due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I‚ÄôM JUST SO EXCITED!!!! 

I know on my first day I‚Äôm gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish I stayed in my comfort zone but I don‚Äôt even care because this just proves to me that if I push through those nasty feelings I really can do anything!!

hylc6u,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxious when being yelled at, or just hearing someone raise their voice?",rlyns319,I've noticed here recently that my chest gets tight and I can hardly breathe when being yelled at or hearing someone raise their voice in general. Does anyone have a way to calm themselves when this happens?,1970,162,1595823131,"I don't have any advice, but yeah, I don't like people yelling or raising their voices. I've never liked conflict, even if it wasn't directed at me. I used to cry even at 17 as my dad yelled at my addict and alcoholic older brother. If I didn't mind my dad yelling, I wouldn't still be having nightmares about arguments 5 years after moving out. People lecturing me/talking to me in a disapproving way is enough to make me cry and shut down. Something in particular comes to mind. I also had nightmares from that. I've tried explaining to people even if they aren't physically yelling at me, my reaction is no different than if they were. It's all the same to me if someone is upset with me. 

I have to remind my husband to not raise his voice when we are debating/disagreeing on something unimportant.",233,SensitiveBugGirl,[deleted],1,[deleted],"Yes, this is absolutely normal and you're not alone in experiencing this! What you're describing sounds like a stress response - your body is reacting to perceived conflict or aggression by going into ""fight or flight"" mode, which causes those physical symptoms like chest tightness and difficulty breathing.

Some things that help me in these situations:
- Deep belly breathing: Focus on taking slow breaths, inhaling for 4 counts and exhaling for 4 counts
- Grounding exercises: Notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, etc.
- Remind yourself that you're safe, even if you feel uncomfortable
- Step away from the situation if possible to give yourself space to calm down

It might also help to explore why yelling triggers this response for you - sometimes it can be linked to past experiences. If these reactions are significantly impacting your daily life, talking to a therapist could give you additional coping strategies.

Remember that your feelings are valid and it's okay to set boundaries around people raising their voices around you. Take care of yourself! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Those first solo highway drives can feel so intimidating, but you faced your fear and did it anyway - that takes real courage!

Don't minimize this achievement. Every small victory against anxiety builds confidence for the next challenge. If you're looking to keep building on this success, try setting small, manageable goals for yourself - maybe driving that same route at a quieter time of day, or gradually increasing the distance as you feel comfortable.

Remember that it's totally okay to take things at your own pace. Some days will be easier than others, and that's normal. You've already proven to yourself that you CAN do this.

Anxiety does make us withdraw from life.,310,[deleted],,0,,"I totally understand this feeling. It's like mourning the experiences you feel you ""should"" have had, even while recognizing that those experiences might not have actually been enjoyable for you at the time. That's a really valid emotional conflict.

But try to remember - there's no single ""normal"" life path that everyone needs to follow. While the high school/college party scene is often portrayed as this universal experience, plenty of people find their social groove later in life when they can connect in ways that actually feel authentic to them.

Instead of focusing on what you missed, maybe think about what kinds of social experiences would genuinely make you happy now. Whether that's small group hangouts, hobby-based meetups, or whatever feels comfortable for you. It's never too late to build the social life you want, at your own pace and on your own terms.

Your anxiety was (and is) a real part of your experience - not something that made your path ""wrong,"" just different. Be gentle with your past self - they were doing their best with the tools they had at the time.","

I just recently moved back home to be with family and got a new job around October. Everything was great and I felt like I was thriving.

While the health crisis is serious, the economic uncertainty is creating a whole different kind of anxiety, especially for younger people with major life plans.

You're not alone in feeling this way. The ground shifting beneath our feet is unsettling, and it's totally valid to worry about your financial future even while acknowledging the health crisis. I'd suggest taking this time to:

1. Build up an emergency fund if possible
2. Cut non-essential expenses
3. Stay flexible with your timeline for those big life events
4. Look into any government assistance programs that might help
5. Keep your resume updated and network maintained

Remember that while this situation is unprecedented, economies do recover. The 2008 crisis felt like the end of the world too, but we bounced back. It might take time, but we will get through this.

Focus on what you can control right now, and try to be gentle with yourself about the things you can't. We're all navigating this together, even if it doesn't always feel that way.","

fo6h6w,Anxiety,Anyone else have to keep reminding themselves the tightness in their chest is probably just anxiety?,Big-Setting,"I‚Äôve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, especially after my job closing due to the covid-19 pandemic.  I keep feeling tightness in my chest and then get stressed worrying I might have a mild case.  Then I have to stop and put myself in check.  Do I have a fever?  No.  Body aches and chills?  No.  Dry cough?  No.  Does anyone else have to keep themselves in check like this?",1802,268,1585061921,Yup my main symptoms are always chest pain and shortness of breath to the point I feel like yawning and gasping for air. Right now I have had a super dry throat and a sensation of having something stuck there for about three weeks and a cough that I think is me trying to get rid of that sensation. Of course this is making me panic more but I'm trying to remind myself the the mind is a crazy thing and all of these sensations are commonly experienced as a symptom of anxiety. It's like I'm sabotaging myself by knowing those of the symptoms and manifesting them. Still freaking out though,288,lunavenusian,"I feel so stupid constantly getting caught off guard by the same chest tightness over and over again.

You'd think after the thousandth time, I'd learn to just ignore it.",12,rainghost,"I totally get what you're going through. That chest tightness from anxiety is so real, and it's extra scary right now because we're all hyper-aware of COVID symptoms. I've definitely caught myself doing the same mental checklist you described.

Something that helps me is to focus on my breathing when I feel that tightness. Try taking slow, deep breaths for a few minutes and notice how the sensation changes. Anxiety often creates physical symptoms that can feel really intense, but reminding yourself that you're checking off all the right boxes (no fever, no cough, etc.) is a smart way to stay grounded.

Losing your job during all of this is incredibly stressful, and it's completely normal to feel heightened anxiety. Your body is responding to a very real situation. Just keep doing what you're doing - being aware and checking in with yourself, while not letting the worry spiral out of control.

Remember that you're not alone in this. So many of us are dealing with similar fears and uncertainties right now. Be gentle with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Try to catch yourself when you start catastrophizing about your finals. Instead of letting your mind spiral into worst-case scenarios, redirect that energy into concrete actions you can take - like studying or getting rest. You're more likely to perform well when you're not paralyzed by anxiety about what *might* happen.

Remember: allowing yourself to fully experience joy doesn't make bad things more likely to happen. You deserve good things, and being happy about them won't jinx anything. Be proud of your accomplishment while staying focused on what's directly in front of you. You've got this! üí™","

Reddit can definitely be intimidating since there's always someone ready to point out mistakes or disagree harshly. I've deleted plenty of draft posts myself for the same reason.

But here's the thing - most subreddits also have plenty of supportive, helpful people. The negative voices just tend to stand out more in our minds. Plus, even if someone does react negatively, you can always ignore/block them or delete the post if needed. You're not stuck dealing with it.

What helped me was starting small in supportive communities and remembering that even ""veteran"" Redditors make mistakes with formatting or rules sometimes. Nobody's perfect here.

The fact that you're thoughtful about your posts already shows you're likely to be a good contributor. Don't let the fear of judgment stop you from engaging with communities you're interested in. The connections and discussions you might have are worth pushing through that initial anxiety.","

j61jth,Anxiety,You are safe,[deleted],"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You‚Äôre not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

The lady at Wendy's was really nice to me and gave me extra bacon and I almost cried. Made me feel motivated to try to live life more.,220,torystory,"Thank you for writing this beautiful reminder. Sometimes in our darkest moments, we forget that we're worthy of self-love and that safety can be found in the smallest gestures around us. Your words about not abandoning ourselves when we're afraid really hit home - it's so easy to get frustrated with our own fears and anxieties.

I especially love your point about how love exists in tiny everyday moments, like someone letting us merge in traffic or a simple ""thank you."" It's a powerful shift in perspective to start seeing these small kindnesses as little pieces of love being shared.

I'm going to save this post for those tough days when I need a gentle reminder to be kind to myself. And you're right - if we can learn to receive and acknowledge these moments of love and safety, we become better at sharing them with others too. It creates this beautiful ripple effect.

Thank you for spreading this message of compassion. We all need to hear it sometimes.","

POST TITLE: You are safe

POST BODY: Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You‚Äôre not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

uxeqkv,Anxiety,I don't think a lot of people realise how much of a disability anxiety can be.,Anxietyshmuck,"Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction",1846,156,1653476118,"Not to mention it's physically exhausting too. Panic attacks, not being able to sleep because your brain won't stop the anxious thoughts, just being constantly on edge takes a toll on the body.",530,1-A_Rep,,0,,"You've hit the nail on the head. As someone who's dealt with anxiety, I completely understand how it can feel like you're fighting an invisible battle that others don't see. It's not just being ""a bit shy"" - it's like having a constant voice telling you everything could go wrong, even in the most basic situations.

What helped me was realizing that anxiety lies to us. It makes mountains out of molehills and convinces us we can't handle things that we're actually perfectly capable of doing. Small steps and celebrating tiny victories really helps - maybe today it's just making that phone call you've been putting off, or walking into a shop you usually avoid.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can provide tools to manage anxiety that actually work. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has helped many people break free from that constant cycle of worried thoughts.

Remember, struggling with anxiety doesn't make you lazy or weak - you're dealing with something very real that affects millions of people. You're not alone in this, even though it can feel that way sometimes.","

The mask has become like a security blanket for a lot of people, myself included. It's interesting how something that started as a health measure turned into a source of comfort for those of us who feel anxious about being observed in public.

When things do return to normal, maybe we can take some lessons from this experience. For instance, most people are actually too focused on their own lives to judge us, and the anxiety we feel about being watched is often more in our heads than reality. Plus, in many places it's becoming more socially acceptable to wear a mask when you want to - like when you're feeling under the weather or just need that extra bit of comfort.

If you're worried about the transition, try taking small steps. Maybe practice short maskless outings in comfortable places first, or work with a therapist to develop coping strategies for social anxiety. Remember, you're definitely not alone in feeling this way - lots of people have discovered similar feelings during the pandemic.","

When I was a kid, I would get so excited the night before/morning of an event (sometimes as small as a trip to the park) that I would get violently physically ill. I ruined a lot of my own birthday parties this way because my parents would need to cancel because I was so sick. I would start off with physical illness, then I'd start to get really upset (now I know these were panic attacks) and cry. 

Even as an adult I have this problem from time to time. Now I am able to calm myself down, but as a kid it was a complete nightmare. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.",263,courtneat,You've got anxiety by the sounds of it my friend. Welcome.,31,MadMatticus21,"Yes! I totally get this. It's like your body goes into ""nervous mode"" even when you're about to do something you're looking forward to. I experience this before concerts, parties, or even just meeting up with good friends - basically any event that breaks the routine, even in a good way.

What helped me understand it better is learning that excitement and anxiety actually trigger very similar physical responses in our bodies (racing heart, butterflies, etc.). Sometimes our brain just defaults to interpreting these sensations as anxiety rather than excitement.

Something that's helped me is actively trying to reframe it - when I feel that nervous energy, I tell myself ""I'm excited"" instead of ""I'm nervous."" It sounds simple, but it can actually help shift your mindset. Also, reminding myself that it's just my body's natural response to anything significant, not a sign that something's wrong.

You're definitely not alone in this! It's a pretty common experience, even if people don't talk about it much.","

You should absolutely be proud of yourself. Not only did you shower, but you went all-in with the full self-care routine. That takes real strength and determination.

Keep celebrating these victories, no matter how small they might seem to others. They're not small at all - they're building blocks back to feeling like yourself again. Maybe try to ride this positive momentum by setting one tiny goal for tomorrow, even if it's just drinking a glass of water or opening a window for fresh air.

You've got this. And on the days when you don't, that's okay too. Progress isn't linear, but you've proven to yourself today that you can do hard things. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Thank you!,87,BendingBird,,0,,"This really hit home for me. It's scary how easy it is to normalize being in a bad situation - whether that's a toxic relationship, depression, a soul-crushing job, or any other form of suffering. Sometimes we get so used to the pain that it becomes our comfort zone, and the idea of change feels more frightening than staying where we are.

I've been there. You start making excuses like ""at least I know what to expect"" or ""maybe this is just as good as it gets."" But that saying is such a powerful reminder that we always have choices, even when it doesn't feel like it.

Happiness isn't just some luxury for other people - it's something we all deserve. Sometimes we just need that gentle nudge to remember that we can choose differently, that we're allowed to want better for ourselves.

Thanks for sharing this. I have a feeling it's going to stick with me, and hopefully help others who might be stuck in their own comfortable-but-painful situations right now.","

Research actually shows that talking to yourself can help with memory, focus, and emotional regulation. It's like having an external hard drive for your brain - speaking things out loud helps process information differently than just thinking it.

I think the only time it would be concerning is if the self-talk becomes extremely negative or if you're hearing voices that aren't your own. But regular conversations with yourself? Totally healthy coping mechanism.

I literally just noticed how tense my jaw was while reading this. It's amazing how we unconsciously hold tension there throughout the day, especially when stressed or focused.

For anyone else who struggles with jaw clenching/tension, here are a few quick tips that help me:
- Gently place your tongue between your top and bottom teeth as a physical reminder to keep them separated
- Do a quick body scan a few times a day, paying special attention to your jaw, shoulders, and forehead
- Try the ""lion's breath"" exercise - open your mouth wide, stick out your tongue, and exhale with a ""hahhh"" sound
- Set random reminders on your phone to check in with your jaw tension

Our bodies really do hold onto stress in sneaky ways. Taking these little moments to consciously relax can make such a difference in reducing headaches and overall tension.

And I get shouted at for it.. people constantly tell me to stop it but I'd rather say sorry than make myself look rude or harsh!,1,keepmeinyourmemory,"I totally get this - it's like ""sorry"" becomes your default response to everything, even when you've done absolutely nothing wrong. I struggled with this too and realized it often stems from wanting to avoid conflict or feeling like you need to minimize your presence.

What helped me was consciously replacing ""sorry"" with more appropriate phrases:
- ""Thank you for your patience"" instead of ""sorry I'm late""
- ""Excuse me"" when trying to get past someone
- ""Let me clarify"" instead of ""sorry, what I meant was...""

Also, try to pause before speaking when you feel that automatic ""sorry"" coming. Ask yourself if you actually did something that warrants an apology. Save real apologies for when they're genuinely needed - it makes them more meaningful.

Remember that over-apologizing can actually diminish your confidence and how others perceive you. It's okay to take up space and exist without constantly apologizing for it. Breaking this habit takes time, so be patient with yourself as you work on it!","

It's not perfect, I'm still ingesting more caffeine than my anxiety says I should. But its a little better than coffee.",82,Randomfandom4,"I totally feel this struggle. It's like being stuck between a rock and a hard place - either deal with heightened anxiety from the caffeine or fight to keep your eyes open all day. What's helped me is finding a middle ground: I switched to half-caf coffee or green tea, which gives me a gentler energy boost without sending my anxiety through the roof.

Also, timing makes a huge difference. Having caffeine earlier in the day (before 2pm) and making sure I eat something with it helps prevent those nasty anxiety spikes. Some days I skip it altogether and focus on other energy-boosting things like getting outside for a short walk or doing some light stretching.

It's really great that you're aware of how caffeine affects your mental health - that self-awareness is super valuable. And you're definitely not alone in this - the depression/anxiety/caffeine triangle is something lots of us deal with. Have you talked to your doctor about this? They might have some good suggestions for managing both conditions while still getting the energy you need.","

Getting through applications and interviews without panic attacks is a massive win, and landing a remote data entry position sounds perfect for easing into the workforce at your own pace.

Don't worry too much about being ""bad"" at first - everyone is learning in their first job, and data entry typically comes with training. Take good notes during training and don't be afraid to ask questions if you're unsure about something. Your team knows you're new!

The fact that you pushed through your fears to get the job AND set up a bank account shows incredible growth. You're absolutely right that ""it can get better"" - each small step builds confidence for the next one. Be proud of yourself today, you've earned it!

Pro tip: Keep a document of your wins and positive feedback as you start working. On anxious days, it helps to look back and remind yourself how far you've come.","

The bond you shared with your cat was incredibly special and profound - he wasn't ""just a pet,"" he was your emotional anchor and constant companion through some of life's darkest moments. What you said about him knowing someone else could watch over you now really touched my heart.

I lost my anxiety support cat a few years ago too, and I completely understand how the grief hits differently when they've been there for your mental health journey. They see us at our most vulnerable and love us unconditionally through it all.

Please be gentle with yourself during this time. Your grief is completely valid. Consider creating a small memorial space with his photo or favorite toy, or journaling about your favorite memories together. Sometimes putting those feelings into words can help process the loss.

I'm glad you have a supportive fianc√© by your side. Your sweet boy left knowing you were in good hands, but he'll always be your spirit animal and first emotional support companion. Sending you much love and strength. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for ‚Äúoutstanding attendance‚Äù which quickly made me realize I‚Äôm the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break.

Sometimes she stays up until 11 or 12 doing it. And high school has caused her a lot of anxiety. She asked one day if she could take a mental day off. I said ‚Äúof course!‚Äù Our mental well being is more important. Anxiety can cause many health issues. I would recommend researching those health issues so that you understand the price you are paying to your employer for your perfect attendance.,205,wgmmc,,0,,"I totally get this. It's ironic how we're often rewarded for potentially unhealthy work habits while sacrificing our mental well-being. That ""outstanding attendance"" recognition probably felt more like a reminder of your burnout than an actual achievement.

Listen, your company will survive without you for a day or two. The insurance industry will keep turning. What won't survive is your mental health if you keep pushing yourself past your limits. That guilt you're feeling? That's been programmed into us by a work culture that often prioritizes presence over well-being.

Taking mental health days isn't just okay - it's necessary maintenance, like getting an oil change for your car. You can't pour from an empty cup, and burning out completely won't help anyone, including your company.

Proud of you for taking that day off. That's a healthy first step. Maybe start scheduling regular ""maintenance days"" for yourself - even if it's just one day every few months. Your mental health matters more than any attendance award.","

It's amazing how anxiety can take these tiny future moments and let them cast such huge shadows over our present joy. That 2-minute call might as well be a 2-hour presentation in our minds, right?

Something that's helped me is reminding myself that my anxiety is essentially lying to me about how big these things are. That call? You'll probably barely remember it a week later. I started writing down these dreaded moments after they happened, rating how bad they actually were versus how bad I imagined them. Almost always, reality was way less scary than my predictions.

Also, you're definitely not alone in this. Look at all the people relating to your post! We're all out here getting worked up about future phone calls and emails together. Sometimes just knowing that helps take some of the edge off.

Try to catch yourself when these thoughts start spiraling and consciously redirect your focus to the good stuff happening right now. Your future self can handle that call when it comes - let your present self enjoy today.","

That constant state of terror and panic is absolutely exhausting, so when it finally burns out into numbness, it can feel like relief.

But please be careful with this thinking. Both depression and anxiety are serious conditions that deserve proper treatment - it's not about choosing the ""lesser evil."" What you're describing sounds like your mind and body are cycling between two difficult states, and you're just trying to cope with whichever one is present.

Have you considered talking to a mental health professional? They can help you develop better ways to manage both conditions so you don't have to settle for either one being your baseline. You deserve to feel genuinely good, not just ""less bad.""

In the meantime, be gentle with yourself. It's okay to take those small steps on the days you can manage them. Just don't lose sight of the fact that there are better options out there than choosing between anxiety and depression. You don't have to face this alone.","

I know it's not easy, but consider trying activities you enjoy (like bowling!) where you might meet people with similar interests. Sometimes it's easier to connect when you're focused on a shared activity rather than just making small talk. The right friends will appreciate you exactly as you are.

The more you worry about your breathing, the more anxious you get, which can then actually make your breathing feel worse.

Something that helps me tell the difference: anxiety-related shortness of breath tends to improve when you get distracted or do slow breathing exercises. COVID shortness of breath usually persists regardless of what you're doing and often gets worse with physical activity.

Try this quick check: Take a slow, deep breath and hold it for a few seconds. If you can do this relatively comfortably, it's more likely anxiety. COVID breathing issues usually make this difficult.

Of course, if you're really worried, there's nothing wrong with getting checked out by a doctor for peace of mind. But know you're definitely not alone in this - it's such a common anxiety experience, especially during these times.","

My only worry now is what I will do when masks stop being normal again...",1770,146,1603981888,"I feel the same way.

Obviously they won‚Äôt be as widespread, but if I could see it becoming a thing to wear a cloth mask if you get a cold and go out just to protect other people. Or even at home when you‚Äôre around  family to avoid spreading it. Cloth masks aren‚Äôt uncomfortable imo.",98,Veryuglybutverycool,"I totally get this. The mask has become like a security blanket for many people with social anxiety - you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. It's interesting how something meant for physical protection ended up providing emotional protection too.

For the future, maybe you could try gradually building confidence while still having the mask as a safety net? Like, start with small interactions where you feel comfortable lowering it briefly, or practice positive self-talk while wearing it. The goal isn't to suddenly be mask-free, but to slowly expand your comfort zone at your own pace.

Remember that even when masks become less common, you can still choose to wear one if you need to - plenty of people wore them for allergies or other reasons before the pandemic. Your mental health matters, and there's no shame in using tools that help you navigate the world more comfortably.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about your social anxiety? They might have some additional strategies to help you feel more confident with or without a mask.","

As someone who's experienced real panic attacks, it's like comparing a paper cut to major surgery when people casually throw around the term for minor anxiety moments.

But I try to remind myself that most people aren't intentionally diminishing our experiences - they just don't have the frame of reference to understand the difference. The word ""panic"" is used so casually in everyday language that the clinical meaning has gotten diluted.

Maybe we can use these moments as opportunities to gently educate others? When someone misuses the term, we could say something like ""Oh yeah, being startled/nervous can be rough. Full-blown panic attacks are actually quite different though - they're more like [brief description]."" Most people are pretty receptive when you explain it that way.

You're absolutely right that it's important to maintain accurate understanding of mental health terms. Your description of a real panic attack was spot-on - that feeling of impending doom and complete loss of control is something you can't really understand until you've been through it.","

POST TITLE: I hate when people use ‚Äúpanic attack‚Äù as a way to say they got nervous for a sec

POST BODY: I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but when people have omg moments where they get scared for a sec and say they had a panic attack, it really bugs me. Like no... that‚Äôs not what a panic attack feels like bro... It‚Äôs actually when you feel like you‚Äôre dying for no reason at all. Like all the air in the room is sucked out and logically you know it‚Äôs not true but your whole body and mind is telling you it‚Äôs over. Is that how it felt when you got nervous for a sec when you dropped something or forgot something? It just promotes a culture that misunderstands what people with panic disorders go through.

Hope you have a blessed day too!",104,ButterBrownie,"Thank you for this, I think I forget far too often.

Hope you have a blessed day too!",104,ButterBrownie,"Thank you for this important reminder. It's so easy to get caught up in the daily grind and endless to-do lists that we forget our mental wellbeing should be the priority. I've learned this lesson the hard way - pushing through exhaustion and anxiety only leads to burnout.

Something that helps me is asking ""Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?"" Most things can wait or be rescheduled. And if you're not in a good headspace, you won't perform your best anyway.

Some gentle suggestions for others reading this:
- It's okay to cancel plans if you're overwhelmed
- Take mental health days from work when needed
- Set boundaries with family about what you can handle
- Break big tasks into smaller chunks
- Practice saying ""no"" without guilt

Remember: You're not being selfish by taking care of yourself. You're ensuring you have the capacity to show up fully when it matters most. Thanks for spreading this message - we all need to hear it sometimes. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

As someone who also deals with test anxiety, I know exactly how nerve-wracking it is to have someone silently judging and taking notes while you're trying to focus on driving.

The fact that you kept trying after 4 attempts shows incredible persistence. A lot of people would have given up, but you pushed through and finally conquered it! That's seriously impressive and you should be really proud of yourself.

Don't let anyone make you feel bad about taking multiple attempts or getting your license at 21. Everyone's journey is different, and what matters is that you got there in the end.

Some things that helped me manage review anxiety:
- Deep breathing exercises (seriously, they work!)
- Writing down specific positive feedback you've gotten throughout the year
- Reminding yourself that reviews are meant to help you grow, not tear you down
- Peppermint tea can help settle your stomach

But here's something that helped me: Many ""normal-seeming"" people are actually dealing with their own versions of these struggles - they've just found ways to cope or mask it better. And that's actually encouraging, because it means these skills can be learned.

Working with a therapist helped me understand that this hypervigilance and social anxiety isn't just ""how I am"" - it's a set of learned responses that can gradually be unlearned. I'm not saying it's easy, but it is possible to build a more manageable relationship with these thoughts.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. The fact that you can recognize and articulate these feelings is actually a really important first step.","

I used to obsess over every potential comment and downvote before posting anything, and sometimes I'd end up just closing the tab without sharing at all. It's weird how much power we give to those little arrows and anonymous opinions, right?

What helped me was starting small - commenting on lighter topics first where there's less pressure. Then I realized that even ""perfect"" posts get downvoted sometimes because that's just how Reddit works. Some of my most thoughtful comments got buried while random jokes got hundreds of upvotes.

Try reframing it: each post is just putting a thought into the world. Some will resonate with people, others won't - and that's okay. The cool thing about Reddit is that there's room for all kinds of perspectives.

Maybe start by finding smaller, friendlier subreddits about topics you're passionate about. Those communities tend to be more supportive, and it's easier to build confidence there.

Remember, even this post about anxiety got responses from people who relate - sometimes vulnerability connects us more than perfectly crafted content.","

And I disagree a tad - IMO a lot of CBT was BS 'positive thinking' (which may be just as unrealistic as negative thibking).",23,x131e,"This resonates with me so much. It's incredibly frustrating when people try to ""logic"" you out of anxiety because guess what? We KNOW it's not logical! That's part of what makes it so distressing - watching yourself spiral over something your rational mind knows isn't a real threat, but your anxiety brain is screaming ""DANGER!""

I've found it more helpful to acknowledge and accept the anxiety rather than fight it. Instead of ""this is irrational, stop feeling this way,"" I try to say ""Hey anxiety, I see you're trying to protect me. Thanks, but I've got this."" It sounds silly, but treating it with compassion rather than frustration actually helps me cope better.

CBT can be really valuable, but you're right - sometimes we need to focus less on challenging the thoughts and more on being gentle with ourselves.

When I'm well-rested, I'm actually much better equipped to handle whatever stress comes my way. The problems feel more manageable when I'm not fighting exhaustion on top of everything else.

Try this: Instead of thinking ""I don't want tomorrow to come,"" focus on ""I'm giving myself the best possible chance to handle tomorrow."" Maybe even do a quick brain dump before bed - write down what's stressing you out so it's not swirling in your head all night.

Understanding that your thoughts are irrational and actually feeling better are two completely different things. That's because anxiety operates on both a cognitive and physiological level - your body can still be in ""threat mode"" even when your logical brain knows there's no real danger.

What's helped me is accepting that it's okay to feel anxious feelings while knowing they're irrational. Instead of trying to make the feelings disappear (which often makes anxiety worse), focus on sitting with them while reminding yourself ""This is just anxiety, and it will pass.""

Some practical things that can help:
- Deep breathing exercises to calm your nervous system
- Physical movement to release the anxious energy
- Grounding techniques (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method)

Remember, you're not broken or failing because you can't ""think"" your way out of anxiety. Your brain is trying to protect you, it's just being overprotective. Be patient with yourself as you work on managing these feelings. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't.

And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

I‚Äôve gotten very good at faking it and I‚Äôve reached my breaking point. I‚Äôm on day 10 of Zoloft and hoping for a bit of relief soon,226,suckerv,"I really feel this. Being ""high-functioning"" can sometimes feel like wearing an exhausting mask all day long. You're absolutely right that mental health struggles don't always look like what people expect.

The fact that you're managing to maintain all those external achievements while battling internal chaos is actually incredible - though I know it probably doesn't feel that way. You're not a fake or a fraud for putting on a brave face. You're surviving, and that takes real strength.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? Not because you're ""broken,"" but because carrying all of this alone is such a heavy burden. There's no shame in getting support, especially given your history of childhood trauma. Many of us ""high-functioning"" folks find that having a safe space to drop the mask can make it easier to wear it when we need to.

You're not alone in this experience. Many of us are out here, looking perfectly put-together while wrestling with similar inner battles. Your post will help others feel seen and understood. Thank you for sharing this.","

I sometimes rehash conversations I wish I‚Äôd had years ago.,443,eclipsed_earth,"This is way more common than you might think! I do this all the time, and I've seen many posts from others who do too. It's like mentally rehearsing conversations or processing social situations, which is actually a pretty natural thing for our brains to do - especially if you deal with anxiety.

The lip movement thing (subvocalization) is totally normal too. It's similar to how some people mouth words while reading or thinking intensely.

While it could be partly related to loneliness or anxiety, it's not necessarily unhealthy unless it's seriously interfering with your life or causing you distress. Many people use these imaginary conversations as a way to work through thoughts, prepare for future interactions, or just decompress from the day.

If you're concerned about it though, you might try:
- Journaling (gives those thoughts a different outlet)
- Meditation (helps calm an overactive mind)
- Actually talking to friends more often (if loneliness is a factor)

But honestly, don't be too hard on yourself about this. It's a much more normal human experience than most people admit!","

kk6u2r,Anxiety,The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,[deleted],"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am ‚Äúinfected‚Äù so he often won‚Äôt stay in the same room as me, sometimes won‚Äôt talk to me, races away from me and won‚Äôt touch things that I‚Äôve touched.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

Not only did you have a good day today receiving love from him, please understand he probably had an even better day because he just made huge progress with his battle with OCD.

I am very impressed someone at such a young age was able to shut down those thoughts for once. 

Godspeed.",159,AfroDevil30,[removed],-14,[deleted],"This brought tears to my eyes. As someone who works with kids with OCD, I know exactly how monumental that hug was - both for you and for him. The fact that he pushed through his intrusive thoughts to give you that physical connection shows just how much he loves you and wants to fight this condition.

And your older son's thoughtfulness with the stocking... wow. You're clearly raising two incredibly empathetic young men who understand the depth of feelings and relationships, even through difficult transitions.

The way you approach your son's OCD with such patience and understanding, recognizing his struggle while still maintaining your emotional connection, is exactly what he needs. You're doing this right, mama. Those moments when our kids show us they're pushing through their challenges for us - those are the ones we hold onto.

Keep being the amazing, understanding mother you are. Your boys are lucky to have you, and it shows in how they express their love for you, each in their own way.","

The lockdown, despite its challenges, created this protective bubble where many of us didn't have to deal with the usual social pressures and expectations. It's completely normal to feel anxious about jumping back into ""regular"" life.

Maybe try easing back into things gradually rather than all at once? Start with small outings or social interactions that feel manageable, and slowly build up your comfort level. There's no rule saying you have to immediately go back to the exact same lifestyle you had before.

Also, try to identify which parts of lockdown actually worked well for you (like having quiet time to yourself) and see if you can incorporate those elements into your new routine. It's okay to set boundaries and maintain some of the self-care habits you developed during this time.

Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way - lots of people are experiencing ""re-entry anxiety."" Be patient with yourself and take it one day at a time. There's no shame in seeking support from friends or a therapist if you're struggling with the transition.","

Proud of you for breaking that barrier today! Even if you go back to lurking after this, you've proven to yourself that you can put yourself out there when you choose to. That's real progress.

gwfrjt,Anxiety,Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,kukkelii,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds.

The combination of IBS and anxiety is brutal, and you're absolutely right that most people don't understand how challenging seemingly simple tasks can become.

It's frustrating that healthcare providers seem fixated on getting you off benzos without offering viable alternatives. While their concern about long-term benzo use is valid, they're missing the bigger picture - you need solutions that work NOW so you can function and hold down a job.

Have you considered working with a GI doctor who specializes in the gut-brain connection? There's strong evidence linking IBS and anxiety, and finding someone who understands both conditions might help develop a more comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, you're doing the right things with diet and exercise, and using benzos sparingly as a tool to function isn't failure - it's survival.

Keep advocating for yourself. You know your body and your needs better than anyone else. Wishing you the best with the job search.","

Have you considered talking to a therapist about your anxiety? They can help provide tools to build confidence and challenge those negative thoughts that make you want to hide. You deserve to walk through the world feeling secure and worthy, not constantly worried about others' judgment.

dgedyv,Anxiety,Skipping classes for my mental health...which impacts my grades...which impacts my mental health.,nikktea,‚ú® college ‚ú®,1708,78,1570796613,Exactly what happens to me. I did it on school and now I do it with work...,176,Today-is-cancelled,,0,,"I totally get this vicious cycle - it's like being stuck in a frustrating loop where each thing makes the other worse. I've been there too.

Here's what helped me break out of it: Start super small. Instead of pressuring yourself to attend every class perfectly, pick just ONE class that feels the most manageable and commit to attending just that one consistently. Even if you miss others, keeping that one anchor point can help you feel more in control.

Also, have you reached out to your school's counseling services? They often have experience helping students through exactly this situation and can sometimes work with your professors to make things more manageable while you get back on track.

Remember: Missing classes doesn't make you a bad student - you're dealing with real struggles. But showing up (even partially) is usually better for mental health than complete isolation. Maybe try sitting near the door if you need an escape route, or making a deal with yourself to stay for just the first 15 minutes.

You're not alone in this. Take it one day at a time, and be proud of any small steps forward. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It's pretty common amongst people with anxiety, adhd, and autism to name some common ones. Bonus points if you have more than one",314,Lloptyr,"I'm sort of the other way around. Certain noises MAKE me anxious and angry. Chewing, screeching, rubbing. It gets under my skin.",69,RyunWould,"Yes, this is absolutely a real and common symptom of anxiety! I experience the same thing - it's like every sound becomes amplified and overwhelming when my anxiety is high. It's called hyperacusis or noise sensitivity, and it happens because anxiety puts our nervous system into ""high alert"" mode.

Using headphones as a coping mechanism is actually pretty smart. I do this too, either with calming music or white noise to help drown out triggering sounds. Some other things that help me:

- Noise-cancelling headphones (game changer if you can afford them)
- Finding a quiet space to decompress when possible
- Deep breathing exercises to help calm the nervous system
- Acknowledging that it's temporary and will pass as the anxiety lessens

Don't feel bad about needing to manage this - it's a totally valid response to anxiety and you're not being ""too sensitive."" Your brain is just trying to protect you, even if it's being a bit overzealous about it. Take care of yourself however you need to during those moments. üíú","

Also does anybody see little dots of light in your vision?",2,OnyxMist08,"I know exactly what you mean - that meta-anxiety is the worst! It's like ""Hey, I'm feeling pretty good right now... wait... why am I feeling good? Something must be wrong!"" and then the anxiety comes flooding back. It's such a frustrating cycle.

What helps me is reminding myself that it's actually NORMAL and GOOD to have periods without anxiety. Those peaceful moments aren't suspicious - they're what we're working towards. Try to practice just sitting with those calm feelings when they come, even if it's just for a few seconds longer each time.

Maybe think of it like this: your brain has been in ""high alert"" mode for so long that feeling calm almost seems foreign. It'll take time to trust that feeling again. Be patient with yourself.

You're not alone in this - lots of us anxiety warriors deal with the same thing. Keep working on accepting those anxiety-free moments as the gifts they are, rather than potential threats. You've got this! üí™","

As someone who understands how anxiety can make even ""simple"" tasks feel overwhelming, getting out there and grocery shopping solo is a major accomplishment - especially with everything you've been through.

I love that you quoted Kevin from The Office - sometimes those small victories really do mean everything. And this isn't even a small victory - this is you actively pushing back against multiple challenges at once.

Please remember that healing isn't linear, and that's okay. Some days will be harder than others, but today you proved to yourself that you're capable of more than your anxiety wants you to believe. Each step forward, no matter how small it might seem to others, is progress.

Keep being gentle with yourself, just like you advised others. You're showing incredible resilience in the face of so many challenges. I hope you're able to celebrate this win and use it as fuel for your next victory, whatever that may be. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

n1smxe,Anxiety,"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.",hey_hi_hello73,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",1658,110,1619785178,"I do not know how you will feel and experience the after effects of this. I'm not sure if my advice will help you. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the thought of how myself, my loved ones, and my dog could be injured while I am driving them around. And then I go for a few short drives to a nearby drivethrough to help normalise it in my head again.

This part I'm not sure will help, but it helps me. Tragedies can occur at any moment whether you're in a car or not. They provide such great quality of life, I'm willing to risk the danger of driving. I'm not willing to risk the danger of not driving. I can drive people to the hospital. I can drive people to school and work, and greatly improve the quality of their life.

I remind myself that cars are designed to be struck. You could have been a walking pedestrian when that car went off the road, but you were in your car. You were in the safest place you could possibly be. Your car did a good job. I'm so thankful that your car was there for you.

Your experience sounds like a really scary one. I would be quite shaken up for a while. When you get a car again, I would make your first drive to a fun place. Maybe a nearby garden centre? And you can try to look forward to it in the meantime.",358,LovesRabbits,Oh that‚Äôs so horrible! Sometimes things like that happen....you always think it won‚Äôt happen to you until it does right? The worst part about it is now driving will be another trigger for your anxiety because of ptsd! Hope things get better for u....I will send positive vibes ur way ;),178,Snowfreak2507,"I'm so sorry this happened to you - you did absolutely everything right by pulling over when you felt unsafe to drive, and it's incredibly unfair that you were still hit while being responsible. Please don't let this make you doubt your judgment about pulling over during panic attacks - that was 100% the right call and likely saved you from a worse outcome if you had tried to keep driving while panicking.

As for moving forward - it's totally normal to feel anxious about driving after an accident like this. Consider talking to your therapist about processing this trauma if you have one. If not, look into finding someone who specializes in accident-related PTSD. Start slow with driving when you're ready - maybe short trips with a supportive person beside you.

The fact that you're already thinking proactively about your mental health is a good sign. Take things one day at a time, be gentle with yourself, and remember that your feelings are valid. You survived something really scary, and it's okay to not be okay right now.

Sending you strength as you navigate this recovery process. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

fq8z5a,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?",PeekAtChu1,"Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don‚Äôt mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it‚Äôs not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won‚Äôt avoid your replies üòÜ

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else‚Äôs experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone &gt;&lt; Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here",1630,134,1585353282,I never knew this had a name!!

I never respond to texts right away when I see them, usually taking days before I do so, and sometimes not returning the text at all. I also NEVERRRR answer my phone. I only answer if I feel it is absolutely necessary or if the person calls, then sends a text for me to call them immediately, n then I will. I haaaate iiiiiit.",81,M4dScientist1,"I totally get this - the anxiety around digital messages is so real and different from in-person communication. I think it's because text/email creates this weird pressure where responses can be analyzed and re-read, plus there's that lingering obligation that sits there until you reply.

What's helped me is setting boundaries around my response times. I'll check messages at specific times during the day rather than letting them constantly interrupt me. And I remind myself that it's completely okay to take time to respond - most people understand that life gets busy.

The gym connection you mentioned makes sense too. Exercise is such a great anxiety reliever, and losing that outlet during lockdown is tough. Maybe try some at-home workouts or even just going for walks to help manage those stress levels?

Don't beat yourself up about this - lots of us struggle with digital communication anxiety. It's a very modern problem that our brains aren't really wired for. Taking care of your mental health comes first, and anyone worth talking to will understand that.","

It's totally valid to feel like you went through the wringer - college can be straight-up torture sometimes, especially when multiple tough classes hit at once. But hey, you DID IT. Even if it wasn't pretty, even if you barely scraped by in some places, you still pushed through and passed. That's something to be proud of.

Take some time to properly decompress before next semester. Your brain and body probably need it after all that stress. Maybe use this experience to think about what made this semester particularly rough and if there are any adjustments you can make for next time - whether that's different study strategies, better time management, or just being more proactive about asking for help when you need it.

It's frustrating how society often expects men to just ""handle it"" while not giving us the same emotional support networks that others receive. That double standard really stings, especially when you're genuinely reaching out for help.

Have you considered looking into men's support groups or finding a therapist who specializes in men's mental health? Sometimes it's easier to open up in spaces specifically designed for men to share their struggles. Plus, therapy gives you that dedicated time where someone's sole purpose is to listen and help you work through things.

Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to be heard just as much as anyone else. It's not weak to need support - it's human. If the people around you aren't giving you what you need right now, please know there are communities and professionals who will take your struggles seriously.

Don't give up on finding the right support system. You're not alone in this, even though it feels that way right now.","

od63e6,Anxiety,I never realized how physically sick anxiety can make you... Does anyone else sometimes feel like they have the flu or something during high-stress times?,AffectionateDealer3,"I‚Äôve been managing my anxiety pretty well the past few months but the last week or so I‚Äôve been feeling like I caught a bug and am constantly tired, my chest hurts, I am incredibly moody and have a short temper, have an upset stomach, etc. I called into work sick a day too because I thought I was sick with something and felt so out of it. I attended an event yesterday I‚Äôve been extremely worried about for the past couple weeks and the second I got in the car to leave it‚Äôs like my sickness just disappeared completely and I felt on cloud 9. It was bizarre. Could this all have been due just to the anxiety? I‚Äôve never had this happen before but I‚Äôve been home since and feel back to normal again.",1569,188,1625345399,"Nausea, body aches, tension headaches, and extreme fatigue.",185,TheRequiemRose,"It‚Äôs totally a thing. I also read somewhere as kids when our stomach is constantly aching and you feel ill but unsure why, anxiety. Of course everyone has it differently, but yeah sorry you were feeling that way.",9,casere496,"Yes, what you're describing is absolutely a real and common manifestation of anxiety! Physical symptoms of anxiety can be intense and genuinely feel like illness - your body's stress response is triggering all sorts of physiological changes. The fact that you felt better right after the stressful event ended is a classic sign that it was anxiety-related.

Some common physical symptoms of anxiety include:
- Fatigue and muscle tension
- Chest pain/tightness
- GI issues/upset stomach
- Headaches
- Sleep problems
- Irritability/mood changes

What helped me was learning to recognize these as anxiety symptoms rather than actual illness. When I notice them now, I try to focus on stress management techniques like deep breathing, exercise, or talking to someone supportive. Also, don't feel bad about taking that sick day - anxiety symptoms are just as valid as any other illness.

Consider tracking your symptoms and their triggers in a journal. This can help you spot patterns and better manage future episodes. And if these physical symptoms become frequent, talking to a doctor or therapist can provide additional coping strategies.","

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
&gt;""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

But I know we can get through it, and you can too.",193,Blebonick,,0,,"Thank you for this beautiful and thoughtful post. It really resonates with me, especially that feeling of being caught in an anxiety spiral while doom-scrolling through the news late at night. You're absolutely right - sometimes the hardest thing is just stepping away and doing basic self-care when everything feels overwhelming.

What helps me is setting strict time limits for news consumption and having a gentle evening routine - even if it's just splashing some water on my face and making a cup of chamomile tea when a full shower feels impossible. Small acts of kindness toward ourselves matter.

I love that Russell quote too. It reminds us that while we can't control everything happening in the world, we can choose to be sources of light and support for each other. Your post is doing exactly that - creating a moment of connection and understanding for all of us struggling with anxiety tonight.

Sending a big virtual hug right back. We're all in this together, taking it one day at a time. üíú","

ivzrch,Anxiety,"Guys, not only did I get a decent job after not working for 4 years but I haven't called or been late yet after my first week!",CatShat23,"Im a terrible flake when it comes to work. My anxiety goes up right before i go in and I end up getting sick and calling off or just not showing up. I'm a terribly unreliable worker.

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was. 

Thank you for reading.

Thanks for the award u/LikeFry-LikeFry!

Thanks u/LuiGian4 for the award! These are the first ever I've gotten!

Final Edit: Thank you everyone who keeps giving me these awards! Its motivated me to want to keep going to work!

Okay actual final edit: Holy shit reddit gold!",1670,69,1600545937,"Congratulations! Enjoy the animals, sounds like a wonderful job!",48,csb7566381,"Congratulations! Enjoy the animals, sounds like a wonderful job!",48,csb7566381,"This is such a huge win - congratulations! As someone who has also struggled with work anxiety, I know how massive it feels to break through that barrier. The fact that you're doing it at a job you actually care about, working with animals, makes it even more meaningful.

Don't be too hard on yourself about the past. Mental health challenges and divorce trauma are serious things that take time to work through. What matters is that you're taking positive steps forward now.

One tip that helped me: Try to build on this momentum by creating small morning routines that make getting to work easier. Having a consistent wake-up time and pre-work ritual can help manage that anxiety. And remember that one rough day doesn't erase this progress - you've already proven you can do this!

Really proud of you for giving yourself this chance and for crushing your first week. The animal shelter is lucky to have someone who cares so much about their work. Keep going! üéâ","

But I'm afraid to text or call him in case he checks his phone while driving and gets into a horrible car accident and dies.

He's come home to me pacing a rut in the living room floor too many times, and in the last couple weeks has started texting me the minute he knows he might not make it out on time.  I feel like a crazy person, but I also appreciate it so so much.",447,Clumsy_Chica,Who say it is?,13,ChuzCuenca,"I feel this so deeply. That spiral from ""they're probably just busy"" to ""they must be dead in a ditch somewhere"" to ""they definitely hate me and never want to speak to me again"" is exhausting and so real.

Something that's helped me is keeping a ""reality check"" note in my phone of times I had these thoughts and they turned out to be completely wrong. Like when I was convinced my friend was ghosting me but they were just swamped with work, or when I thought my mom was in danger but her phone had just died.

It doesn't make the anxiety go away completely, but it helps me challenge those intrusive thoughts with actual evidence from my own life. And remember - anxiety lies to us. It takes normal situations and turns them into worst-case scenarios.

If you're not already seeing someone about this, therapy can be really helpful for developing more tools to manage these thoughts. You're not alone in this, and it's not your fault your brain works this way. Sending you support. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

If the emotions you experience are extreme, I would say this is from the trauma you experienced in your (possibly?) disfuncional family or if you‚Äôve been an abuse survivor. Either way, talking to a counselor may help you make these experiences not as intense.",5,hannah4smiles,"Yes, this is actually a really common trauma response, and you're not alone in feeling this way. I have similar reactions where I get incredibly anxious and need to escape when people are angry or arguing, even if it has nothing to do with me. It's your nervous system responding to what it learned was a threat during childhood.

What you're describing - hiding away, using music to drown out voices, needing darkness and quiet - these are all self-soothing techniques you've developed to help yourself feel safe. They're actually pretty healthy coping mechanisms in the moment.

If you can, talking to a therapist would be really helpful. They can help you understand these reactions better and develop additional tools to manage the anxiety. In the meantime, please know that your response is totally normal given your experiences, and you're doing the right thing by reaching out and trying to understand it better.

Keep taking care of yourself the way you know how, and don't feel bad about needing to step away when you're triggered. Your feelings are valid. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

What are we fighting for?",40,[deleted],"Thank you for this powerful message. As someone who has dealt with anxiety, that feeling of being ""stuck"" in fight-or-flight mode is something that's really hard to explain to others. The physical symptoms - racing heart, tight chest, derealization - can be absolutely terrifying, yet we keep pushing forward.

You're absolutely right that it's not a competition. Whether someone has occasional anxiety or severe panic disorder, each person's struggle is valid and real. What helps me is remembering that even though anxiety feels endless in the moment, every single panic attack has eventually passed. We've survived 100% of our worst days so far.

For anyone reading this who's struggling: Please know that seeking help isn't weakness - it's actually incredibly brave. Whether that's therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of tools, you deserve support. You're not broken, and you're definitely not alone in this fight.

I talked to my friends about my ocd, talking about your anxiety with your loved ones may help in this case, and how i feel triggered and struggle, now they try to be cautious about it. I also feel better since they know the situation. So, explaining things that triggers you to the people you talk daily may help you too. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",6,iwearanecklace,"I feel this in my soul! That constant need for reassurance is exhausting, isn't it? Like your brain is always whispering ""but what if they secretly hate me?"" no matter how many times people say otherwise.

Here's the tricky thing - while getting reassurance feels good in the moment, constantly seeking it can actually make anxiety worse in the long run. It's like feeding a hungry monster that just keeps getting bigger and hungrier.

Have you considered working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can help you develop tools to better manage those intrusive thoughts and build more confidence in your relationships. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be especially helpful for breaking that reassurance-seeking cycle.

In the meantime, try to remind yourself that if someone is genuinely upset with you, they'll likely tell you directly. Most people aren't secretly harboring anger - they're probably too busy worrying about their own stuff, just like we are! 

Sending you understanding and support. Anxiety is tough, but you don't have to figure it out alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Sleep anxiety is a real thing and that vicious cycle of ""I need to sleep ‚Üí stress about not sleeping ‚Üí can't sleep because stressed"" is absolutely maddening. I've been there too.

What helped me was accepting that even if I don't sleep perfectly, I'll still be okay. Try shifting your mindset from ""I MUST sleep right now"" to ""I'm just resting my body and mind."" Some nights you might just rest without sleeping much, and that's fine.

A few practical tips that worked for me:
- Get out of bed if you're anxious (do something calm like reading until you feel sleepy)
- Focus on slow breathing (4 counts in, 4 counts out)
- Listen to sleep stories or meditation apps
- Keep your bedroom cool (helps with the sweating)

Remember that occasional sleepless nights are normal and your body has amazing ways of compensating. The less pressure you put on yourself to sleep, the more likely it is to come naturally.

Hope this helps! You're definitely not alone in this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

lpa08i,Anxiety,Please start exercising,Alexle0,"I‚Äôve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who said they‚Äôre unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you‚Äôre having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",1521,208,1613951549,Proud of you.,202,TheSeasoner91,"I used to play team sports before the pandemic, and I'm a firm believer that that was one of the only things keeping my hidden depression/anxiety at bay. We were very briefly allowed to play again at the end of summer last year and I improved dramatically, and now it's stopped again I'm back to being a mess! Exercise is sooo good for you!",121,marveldinosaur99,"This is so inspiring and exactly what I needed to read today. As someone who also deals with anxiety, I completely understand how debilitating it can be. It's amazing how you've found such significant relief through exercise, especially going from multiple ER visits to feeling more in control of your life.

I really appreciate how you emphasize the importance of easing into it and listening to your body. Too often people try to do too much too fast and end up discouraged. Your approach of mixing walking with weights, and being okay with rest days when needed, is so sensible and sustainable.

The way you describe the mental transformation - regaining your humor and confidence, worrying less about every bodily sensation - really shows how exercise can be powerful medicine for both body and mind. Thanks for sharing your journey and giving hope to others who might be struggling. Keep up the amazing progress! üôå","

Anxiety really does feel like it puts an invisible barrier between you and the life you want to live. All those ""what-ifs"" and missed opportunities because our brains decided to hit the panic button.

But here's something I've learned through my own battle with anxiety - while it might have robbed us of some moments in the past, it doesn't have to define our future. Every small victory against anxiety, whether it's making that phone call you've been avoiding or simply leaving the house on a bad day, is reclaiming a piece of your life.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? Modern anxiety treatments have come a long way, and there's no shame in getting help. Even small steps like breathing exercises or gradual exposure to anxiety-triggering situations can make a huge difference over time.

You're not alone in this struggle. Anxiety is a thief, yes, but you're stronger than you think. Your awareness of what anxiety has taken from you is actually the first step toward taking it back.","

Just a friendly heads up - those first few solo drives can feel both liberating and a bit nerve-wracking. Take it slow, stick to familiar routes at first, and maybe avoid rush hour until you build up more confidence. It's totally normal to feel a bit anxious!

The fact that it took you years of practice shows real persistence. A lot of people give up when they don't succeed right away, but you stuck with it and made it happen. That's something to be really proud of.

Enjoy your newfound freedom! Just remember we were all new drivers once, and there's no shame in taking things at your own pace. Stay safe out there! üöó","

lqt7cs,Anxiety,"The whole world seems excited for lockdown to end, but no one seems to be talking about those of us who are feeling anxious about normal life returning. Surely I am not on my own?",Silent_scroller94,"This has been a strange year for everyone, with huge life changes for all and so much sadness throughout. Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way. 

My relationship with my girlfriend ended almost 2 months ago now, and whilst there have been good days and bad days, I can‚Äôt help shake this feeling of dread and anxiety over normal life returning. It‚Äôs as if life is going to take off full speed ahead and I‚Äôm going to be left in its wake, struggling to adjust to this new single way of life. 

Everything you hear on the news speaks about excitement, parties, pubs, nightclubs and all the ‚Äòjoy‚Äô that this is going to bring, but no one seems to address the fact that it‚Äôs going to be a real struggle to adjust back into this ‚Äònormal‚Äô way of life for many of us.

I also think it's helpful to understand that when people say this, they are probably more excited about the idea of getting out of isolation and I would bet more people than not are probably having some feelings of dread at the thought of returning to ""normal"". There's a lot of truth in what you said ""Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way."" Honestly, a lot of the talk about getting back to normal is probably a product of people not knowing what to say. Lockdown has sucked for most everyone for various reasons and I know I'm guilty of saying I'm looking forward to a return to normal when I really don't mean it - I just don't know what to say!  I've been lucky enough to have an office job and have been remote except for maybe 15 days since March and it gives me a lot of anxiety when I think back on what was normal for me a year ago vs. now.",17,SecretSunflower1,"You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. While everyone's talking about the excitement of ""getting back to normal,"" the reality is that many of us have gone through significant life changes during lockdown - like your breakup - and the world we're returning to isn't the same one we left.

It's completely valid to feel anxious about this transition. The pandemic forced us to adapt to a slower, more isolated lifestyle, and suddenly jumping back into social situations at full speed can feel overwhelming, especially when you're also processing a relationship ending.

Maybe try taking it at your own pace? There's no rule saying you have to dive straight into parties and crowded places. Start with small meetups with close friends, or activities you genuinely enjoy. Focus on rebuilding your routine in a way that feels comfortable for you.

Remember that many others are feeling similar anxiety - even if they're not talking about it as openly. This ""re-entry anxiety"" is a real thing, and it's okay to take time to adjust. Be gentle with yourself as you navigate both the post-lockdown world and your personal healing journey ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Pro tip: What helped me get more comfortable with phone calls was starting small exactly like this - quick, simple calls where there's not much that can go wrong. Each time you do it, it gets a tiny bit easier. Maybe next time you could try calling to check a store's hours, or make a quick appointment somewhere.

Love your energy btw - ""dialed the fuck out of that number"" made me laugh. Keep that victory mindset! Every small win against anxiety is worth celebrating. Hope that pizza was delicious - you definitely earned it! üçï","

I totally relate to going into ""polite robot mode"" around new people. It's like there's this weird pressure to be a super sanitized version of yourself, right? I catch myself doing the exact same thing - speaking more formally, holding back my actual sense of humor, and doing that awkward over-laughing thing.

Here's what's helped me: I try to remind myself that my authentic personality is actually what makes connections meaningful. Start small - maybe let one genuine reaction or joke slip through, or use a bit of your normal speaking style. You'll often find that people respond really well to authenticity, even if it's a bit quirky.

Also, this behavior usually comes from wanting to be ""safe"" and accepted, which is totally normal! But ironically, those bland conversations are probably way more uncomfortable than just being yourself would be.

Don't beat yourself up about it though - most people struggle with this to some degree. The fact that you're aware of it is actually the first step to breaking out of that pattern.","

Something that's helped me understand these swings better is realizing that healing isn't linear. Those positive periods aren't ""fake"" just because you had a setback - they're real progress, even if it doesn't feel that way during the low points. Each time you bounce back, you're building resilience, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment.

Have you considered keeping a ""wins journal""? During your good periods, write down your breakthroughs and positive moments. When you hit those low points, it can help remind you that you're capable of feeling better and that the negative spiral isn't your permanent state.

Remember to be gentle with yourself during the dips. You wouldn't expect a physical injury to heal without some pain and setbacks - emotional healing works the same way. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

What's helped me is reminding myself that these thoughts are just anxiety talking, not reality. Your friends aren't suddenly mad at you just because communication is different right now. If there hasn't been any conflict, try to take their friendship at face value.

Maybe you could suggest video calls instead of just texting? Seeing faces and hearing voices can help quiet those anxious thoughts. Also, being honest with your close friends about these feelings might help - they may even feel similar ways themselves.

Remember that seeking reassurance is a totally normal response to an abnormal situation. Be gentle with yourself. Your brain is just trying to protect you, even if it's being a bit overzealous about it. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I started asking myself: ""Can I remember what that person at the grocery store was wearing yesterday? What about my coworker's hairstyle last week?"" Usually, the answer is no. This helps me realize that others probably aren't scrutinizing my appearance either.

Something that's helped me is redirecting that self-critical energy into self-care instead. Rather than obsessing over how my hair looks, I focus on how good it feels after a nice wash and style. Instead of worrying about my outfit, I wear what makes me comfortable and confident.

We're all the main character in our own story, but we're just background characters in everyone else's. And that's actually pretty liberating when you think about it!","

Phone calls are seriously one of those weird adult skills that nobody really teaches you but everyone expects you to just know how to handle. Each one you make gets a little easier than the last, I promise. Pro tip: I sometimes jot down quick bullet points of what I need to say before making calls - it helps keep me focused when the anxiety tries to make my mind go blank.

Last night I slept-brushed my teeth. I don't like it. Not looking forward to going to sleep.,2,PorkRoll4Initiative,"I know exactly what you mean. It's like being stuck between not wanting to deal with the present anymore but also dreading what tomorrow brings. That feeling of wanting to pause time in that late-night limbo is so real.

Something that helped me reframe this was realizing that sleep itself can be a form of self-care, not just a fast-forward button to tomorrow. When I'm well-rested, I'm better equipped to handle whatever tomorrow throws at me. Plus, those quiet nighttime hours can actually be peaceful if we stop viewing them as just the countdown to tomorrow.

Have you tried creating a small nighttime ritual that you can look forward to? Maybe some gentle music, a few pages of a book, or even just 5 minutes of stretching. It gives those hours their own value instead of just being the waiting room for tomorrow.

Remember, tomorrow will come whether we sleep or not - might as well face it with a clearer mind and recharged battery. Sending support your way - these feelings are totally valid and more common than you might think.","

That awful feeling when you send something to the group chat and it's just *crickets*. I used to spiral hard about it too - convinced I said something dumb or everyone secretly hated me.

What helped me was realizing a few things:
1. People are often just busy or distracted, not ignoring you specifically
2. Sometimes convos naturally die down and it's not about your message
3. Others probably don't analyze every message the way we do!

I started practicing what I call the ""24-hour rule"" - not letting myself stress about no responses until at least a day has passed. Usually by then someone has replied or I've forgotten about it anyway.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Group chat anxiety is super common, especially for those of us who tend to overthink social interactions. Be gentle with yourself - chances are your friends aren't judging you nearly as harshly as you're judging yourself. üíú","

Something that's helped me is setting aside dedicated ""worry time"" - like 15 minutes where I actually let myself worry intentionally. Then when anxious thoughts pop up during the day, I tell myself ""Not now - I'll deal with this during worry time."" It sounds silly, but it helps create some mental boundaries.

Also, try grounding exercises when you notice you're spiraling. Focus on 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, etc. It forces your brain to connect with the present moment instead of time-traveling to future scenarios.

You're already self-aware enough to recognize the pattern, which is honestly a huge first step. Be patient with yourself - breaking the anxiety cycle takes time. But it is possible to quiet those racing thoughts bit by bit. Sending you strength, friend. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

That racing mind and feeling of needing to respond quickly before fully processing things? Been there so many times.

Here's what helps me: I try to remind myself that anxiety actually takes up a lot of our mental bandwidth. When part of your brain is occupied with worry and stress, it's completely normal to feel scattered or make mistakes. You're not getting ""dumber"" - your mental energy is just being divided.

Something that's helped me is practicing the ""pause."" When I feel those anxious thoughts racing, I take a deliberate breath before speaking or acting. Even just 2-3 seconds can help your brain catch up. It feels awkward at first, but most people won't even notice the brief pause.

And hey, try to be gentle with yourself when you do slip up. Everyone says awkward things sometimes - anxiety just makes us hyperfocus on those moments. You're dealing with a legitimate challenge, not a character flaw.","

It's frustrating because you're not actually dumb at all - your brain is just occupied with managing stress and trying to navigate an unfamiliar environment. Construction sites can be particularly overwhelming with all the new faces, safety concerns, and pressure to learn quickly.

Also, it's okay to set boundaries. You don't have to respond to everything immediately. Maybe block out specific times each day for handling communications, so it feels more contained and manageable. And with friends, it's perfectly fine to be honest and say you're feeling a bit overwhelmed with school starting up.

The fact that you're aware of this reaction is actually really helpful - you can work with it rather than fighting it. Consider talking to your school's counseling services too. They often have great strategies for managing school-related anxiety.

You've got this! Just take it one small step at a time.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get overwhelmed and anxious as soon as they have a responsibility to fulfil (answering a text, an email, etc.)?

POST BODY: I‚Äôm going back to law school next week, and a bunch of communication from volunteering groups, clubs, friends, etc. have started up again. I feel like crawling under my covers every time I think about having to schedule a meeting or return a phone call to someone. It hasn‚Äôt ever been this bad before. I don‚Äôt even want to answer texts from my friends that are back in town, because that means we need to get together. 

Ex: I had to send a mass email to a few organizations to see if they wanted to arrange a presentation with my volunteer group. I‚Äôve already received a voicemail and an email in response. The idea of needing to respond and figure out logistics makes me body turn to stone. I just want to ignore it all and pretend I never heard back from anyone...

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you snap out of it?

It‚Äôs almost like a weird superstition. ",9,forwardyoufly,"This resonates with me so much. When you have anxiety, it's like having an overly-sensitive alarm system that goes off at everything - both real threats and completely harmless situations.

What's helped me is learning to distinguish between anxiety thoughts and genuine intuition. Anxiety tends to be more frantic, immediate, and often spirals into ""what-if"" scenarios. True gut feelings are usually calmer, steadier, and more specific to the situation at hand.

Try this: When you get that feeling, pause and ask yourself:
- Is this thought racing and panicky, or quiet and persistent?
- Can I identify what exactly is bothering me, or is it vague?
- Is this a familiar anxiety pattern I've experienced before?

It takes practice, but over time you can start to recognize the difference between anxiety's false alarms and your actual intuition. Working with a therapist can also help you develop these skills.

Remember, having anxiety doesn't mean your intuition is broken - it just means you need different tools to interpret those signals.","

The mask has become like a little security blanket for some of us, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's interesting how something that started as a health measure has turned into a comfort item for many people dealing with social anxiety or self-consciousness.

I've noticed quite a few posts about this over the past year - lots of people have found that masks help them feel more confident in public spaces. Some like the anonymity, others appreciate not having to worry about their facial expressions, and many just feel more ""protected"" in general.

If wearing a mask makes you feel more comfortable and doesn't interfere with your daily life, there's no reason to stop. Just make sure you're not using it as a way to completely avoid dealing with underlying anxiety if that's something you struggle with. But as a tool to help manage everyday stress? Totally valid!

lfmrtn,Anxiety,Anybody else find it suspicious when they‚Äôre NOT anxious,[deleted],My mind instantly goes to all the worst possible scenarios. It‚Äôs like an addiction to overthink and be anxious. Feels odd to feel calm... anyone else?,1527,131,1612820788,I always think if I let myself be calm something bad will happen.,246,MeetStrong,"When I was recovering from depression and anxiety (which I struggled with for the first 25 years of my life) I felt a weird sort of void when I was feeling calm and peaceful. I can go back and look at journal entries from that time and often noted a feeling of ""emptiness"" or ""numbness"" and that I felt like something was ""missing."" -- since that time I have realized how to let go of ideas about how I ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" feel.   


I have found a daily meditation practice and paleo (low carb/whole foods) diet has virtually eliminated this ""empty"" feeling. There is no such thing as empty, there is just calm, and it's okay to be calm. I notice it. I actively try to quiet my mind and explore the calmness. To turn off the voice in my head (release it, let it go), for at least a few minutes at a time. And when I do this (usually through meditation) I often feel like I have had a power nap. I have literally felt a sensation like cool water on my brain, right behind my eyes. It's awesome.",5,Adoniram1733,"Yes! I totally get this. When you're so used to anxiety being your ""normal,"" those calm moments almost feel wrong or like you're missing something important. It's like your brain is saying ""Hey, shouldn't we be worrying about something right now?""

I've learned that this is actually pretty common for people with anxiety. We get so accustomed to being in ""alert mode"" that peace and calm become the unfamiliar states. Sometimes we even unconsciously look for things to worry about just to return to that familiar anxious feeling.

Try to remind yourself that feeling calm is actually your brain and body working as they should. Those peaceful moments aren't suspicious - they're glimpses of what life can be like as you work through your anxiety. Instead of questioning the calm, try to sit with it and observe it without judgment. It might feel weird at first, but gradually you can learn to trust these quieter moments.

You're not alone in this experience. It's all part of the journey of managing anxiety and learning to embrace peace when it comes.","

Something that gives me peace is realizing that most people are so caught up thinking about their own embarrassing moments that they rarely remember or care about others' slip-ups. And those who do remember probably look back and think ""hey, we were all just kids figuring stuff out.""

Try to treat your younger self with the same compassion you'd show a friend or younger sibling who made those mistakes. You were doing your best with the tools and knowledge you had at the time.

ms6sy6,Anxiety,My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.,weeblybeebly,"It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",1552,96,1618590368,Wow that is a game changer. I‚Äôve been treating discomfort as the enemy because I didn‚Äôt like it (duh) but the growing pain makes a lot of sense. Growing as a person comes with a cost. Discomfort is a big issue with a good chunk of my anxiety. Thank you for sharing!! I have some thinking to do.,199,secretsmakeX,"When you encounter enemies in a video game it means you're going the right way

Edit: Thinking this has helped me work my way through a lot of uncomfortable situations and relationships. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs resonated with so many people here. Also I stole this from someone on Reddit, I can‚Äôt remember the thread but I‚Äôve been saying this to myself for years.",187,thugnificent856,"This is such a powerful realization - thank you for sharing it! I really connect with your experience of avoiding uncomfortable situations and the anxiety spiral of ""what if"" thoughts. Your therapist's perspective about comfort seeking being natural but potentially limiting is spot on.

I love the growing pains analogy. Just like physical exercise can be uncomfortable but makes us stronger, pushing through social/emotional discomfort builds our resilience. I've found that the anticipation of discomfort is often worse than the actual experience itself.

It's incredibly encouraging to hear how you've started putting this into practice and seeing results. Taking those first steps is the hardest part, but you're proving to yourself that you're capable of handling these situations. That's huge progress!

For anyone else reading this who struggles with similar fears - start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that some discomfort is actually a sign you're growing. You don't have to tackle everything at once, but each small victory builds confidence for the next challenge.","

czqtqt,Anxiety,Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?,QueenFrankie420,"I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. My stomach will hurt and occasionally I'll get heartburn. Only when I'm highly anxious.

I just wondered if anyone else gets this and can't think of anywhere I'd be more comfortable asking....

Edit - wow, this blew up. I had no idea this was such a common thing!",1424,224,1567631317,100% yes. It's awful. I'm now at the point where if I get a stomach ache for any reason I'm immediately anxious because I'm connecting the fact that anxiety makes me sick. It's a vicious cycle.,249,maggiemoocorgipoo,"Yes! 

Here is a story of me and my anxiety last summer.

I was going through a really stressful time. My sleep was shit and I was sad all the time. I started noticing at some point that my stomach had started hurting all the time. I would get weird different types of stomach pains in different areas of my stomach. I would have diarrhea and nausea literally every morning.

I ended up going to the doctor. A lot. I visited time and time again, always complaining about my stomach. They would run blood tests, take samples of my poop and eventually they even took an ultrasound of my stomach. I was in constant pain all the time. Yet nothing was wrong. 

I even got one of those things with a camera shoved down my throat to check my stomach. Yet again, nothing wrong. I never found any relief in any of the doctors telling me I was ok.

I wasnt ok! I was feeling like shit. I went to the gas station one day to fill up, and there was a restaurant attached, so I decided to order a warm meal. I took one bite and suddenly it felt like my heart was about to burst. I ran to the bathroom and it felt like I couldnt breathe. 

I was having my first panic attack. I didnt know this at the time. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I drove home to see my mother. She was watering some plants and I just told her everything and how scared I was.

She looked at me and said what im experiencing is completely normal. She said everybody goes through anxiety at some part of their life. She then asked me if I was hungry. I said yeah sure.

Just half an hour ago I was sitting in a gas station bathroom crying and feeling like shit, but now I was eating normally. Actually I was eating like a madman lol.

Slowly, but surely I started to understand It was my anxiety causing all this. 

I got even more confirmation the next week when I went to my sisters and her husband. We went fishing and had a couple of beers afterwards. Didnt know I was dealing with anxiety at the time, bad idea to drink alcohol.

We all went to bed and I just couldnt sleep. My heart was beating out of my chest! It felt like my chest was going to explode. I called a taxi and went to the hospital. I complained about shortness of breath and my heart beating like crazy. Got everything checked up and the nurses said there is nothing wrong with me. I chatted with them for a while and one of them asked if I had ever experienced panic attacks. 

At that point I truly started realizing what I was dealing with. OP if you read all the way here, just know that what is happening is normal and part of the process. The pain you feel is real! The tools to combat, however, might be in your mind! 

A year later I‚Äôm still struggling with anxiety but everything regarding gastrointestinal issues I am able to process relatively well.",45,perae,"This is incredibly common - you're definitely not alone! The gut-brain connection is very real, and anxiety can wreak havoc on your digestive system. I deal with the exact same symptoms when I'm really stressed or anxious.

Some things that have helped me:
- Deep breathing exercises, especially focusing on belly breathing
- Peppermint tea (it's naturally calming and helps with digestion)
- Avoiding caffeine when anxious, since it can make both anxiety and GI symptoms worse
- Simple foods that are easy on the stomach during anxious periods

If it's really impacting your quality of life, talking to a doctor can be helpful. They might recommend ways to manage both the anxiety and GI symptoms together. Sometimes just knowing these physical symptoms are ""normal"" anxiety responses can help reduce the worry about them.

Hang in there - anxiety is rough, but you're not weird or alone in experiencing this! The mind and gut are super connected, and what you're describing is a very typical stress response.","

You're not alone in feeling this way. It's exhausting to constantly push your happiness to some future milestone.

Have you considered working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you some really effective techniques for managing those physical symptoms, like progressive muscle relaxation and breathing exercises. They helped me a lot with the muscle tension especially.

You're definitely not alone in this. So many of us are dealing with similar struggles while looking ""fine"" on the outside. Sending you strength - this stuff is really hard but it can get better with the right support and tools. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

POST TITLE: I wish people understood the turmoil in stomach, the heart rate increase, muscle tension, the heavy breathing and every other physical symptom of anxiety

POST BODY: I have high functioning anxiety and sometimes when I am really anxious I get all the above mentioned symptoms and it sucks. It sucks big time. I wish I could make people understand this is what I feel when I get anxiety because people don't understand they think it's just 'worrying'

Edit- I was not expecting such a response on this post. I feel better looking at the comments that I am not alone. I hope we all get through it. I hope all is see better and anxiety free days soon!

a31oct,Anxiety,Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?,Beanini666,"I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.

I've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to ""act"" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  
My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.

Has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it? Sorry if this was long and ""venty"" I just feel trapped in my head! *Takes brain out and throws it out the window* 

Thank you :-)

Edit: wow thank you everyone for all of your comments. It means a lot that we can share and relate here, to know we are not alone on this. ",1463,177,1543937500,[deleted],311,[deleted],[deleted],311,[deleted],"I completely relate to what you're describing. That mental fog and feeling of diminished cognitive ability is a very real symptom of chronic anxiety. You're not actually becoming less intelligent - your brain is just using so much energy dealing with anxiety that it has fewer resources available for other tasks.

What helped me was understanding this isn't permanent damage, but rather your mind's response to being constantly in ""threat detection"" mode. Some things that made a difference for me:

- Regular meditation/mindfulness practice (even just 5-10 mins daily)
- Getting proper sleep and exercise 
- Working with a therapist on CBT techniques
- Taking breaks when feeling overwhelmed instead of pushing through

The fact that you're self-aware enough to recognize these changes is actually a sign of intelligence. Your analytical mind is still there - it's just currently preoccupied. Be patient with yourself as you work on managing the anxiety. Your mental clarity and interests will gradually return as your nervous system learns to relax again.

You're definitely not alone in this experience. Anxiety is exhausting but it doesn't define your capabilities.","

Sometimes I actually have and idk why this happens? In my brain I‚Äôm like ‚Äúok I‚Äôm good nothing bad is here‚Äù but my body just gets the WORST nausea I‚Äôve ever experienced. Does this happen to anyone else? And how can I fix it?,1431,208,1590768343,"Yes.  At this point, I often feel the nausea before the emotions of anxiety.

Now if I get a stomach ache, I ask myself, what am I nervous about?",226,Hannajomac,"Yes, anxiety nausea is absolutely real and you're definitely not alone in this! The mind-body connection is powerful - even when our thoughts are relatively calm, our body can still react with physical symptoms like intense nausea. It's actually super common with anxiety.

What's helped me personally:
- Deep belly breathing (sounds clich√© but it really helps settle the stomach)
- Ginger tea or candies 
- Small sips of cold water
- Focusing on a specific object or texture to ground myself
- Progressive muscle relaxation

You might also want to try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique when you feel it coming on: Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. This helps redirect your brain and can calm the physical symptoms.

If it's happening frequently, talking to a doctor or therapist could be really helpful - they can give you more specific strategies based on your situation. Just remember you're not weird or broken for experiencing this. Anxiety manifests differently for everyone!","

Sometimes it is painful .,1418,219,1584713634,Yup.  I stress don‚Äôt eat,256,Juicecalculator,,0,,"This is totally normal and you're definitely not alone! The gut-brain connection is very real - anxiety can directly affect your digestive system, causing stomach aches, nausea, and yes, urgent bathroom trips. It's often called ""nervous stomach"" or anxiety-induced IBS.

When we're anxious, our body goes into fight-or-flight mode, which can speed up digestion and cause discomfort. Some things that have helped me and others manage this:

- Deep breathing exercises (especially diaphragmatic breathing)
- Peppermint tea or ginger tea
- Avoiding caffeine when anxious (it can make both anxiety and stomach issues worse)
- Light stretching or gentle walking
- Using a heating pad on your stomach

If it's becoming a regular issue that's disrupting your life, it might be worth talking to your doctor. They can rule out other causes and possibly recommend ways to manage both the anxiety and stomach symptoms.

Just remember that this is a common physical response to anxiety - you're not weird or alone in experiencing this! üíú","

mvjotr,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxious over literally nothing?,artificialn0cturne,"I'm not even worried about anything specifically. It's just a lingering anxiety. It's so annoying, it happens a lot right before bed too.",1462,175,1619023222,"Sure, that's a hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder.",308,larki18,,0,,"Yes, absolutely! What you're describing sounds like generalized anxiety - where you feel anxious without a clear trigger or reason. It's actually super common, especially that nighttime anxiety when you're trying to sleep. Your mind finally gets quiet and then it's like your body decides ""perfect time to feel inexplicably uneasy!""

Some things that have helped me:
- Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 breathing is great before bed)
- Writing down random thoughts/worries before sleep to ""get them out""
- Having a consistent bedtime routine to signal your brain it's time to wind down
- Limiting screen time before bed
- Light exercise during the day to burn off that anxious energy

Don't feel like you have to ""justify"" your anxiety or have a specific reason for feeling this way. Sometimes our bodies just get stuck in that fight-or-flight mode for no good reason. If it's really impacting your life though, talking to a therapist can be super helpful - they can give you more personalized coping strategies.

Those rare moments of mental quiet really highlight just how exhausting it is to live with constant anxiety and intrusive thoughts. It's like suddenly realizing you've been carrying a heavy backpack when you finally get to take it off for a brief moment.

But I've learned something important through therapy - even people who seem carefree still have their struggles. The difference is often in how they've learned to process thoughts and emotions, not that they're completely free of worry. It's a skill that can be developed, even if it feels impossible now.

Have you considered talking to a mental health professional? They can teach you practical techniques to help quiet those racing thoughts. Mindfulness and CBT were game-changers for me. While I still have anxious days, I'm slowly learning to let thoughts pass without latching onto them.

You're not alone in feeling this way. Many of us understand that constant mental battle. But there are ways to make the load lighter, even if we can't put it down completely. Be gentle with yourself - you're dealing with something really challenging.","

ej29di,Anxiety,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,courtneat,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year.

Grind away until you die, hope that you don't get sick.",281,TheFakeZzig,"You're definitely not alone in feeling this way - I think a lot of us in our 20s hit this realization hard when we enter the workforce full-time. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed by the prospect of doing this for decades.

A few things that helped me cope: First, your first job won't be your forever job. As you gain experience and skills, you'll likely move into roles that are more fulfilling and better paying. Second, try to find a workplace with better work-life balance - some companies offer more PTO and flexibility than others.

Focus on building skills that can lead to better opportunities. Maybe that's additional certifications, learning new software, or developing expertise in your field. This can help you transition to jobs that either pay more (so you can save for those goals like travel) or offer better hours/benefits.

Also, don't compare your current situation to your whole life's goals all at once. Break it down into smaller chunks and shorter-term goals. You don't have to figure out the next 45 years right now.

Hang in there - this feeling is really common and valid. It does get better as you find your path.","

That said, while masks can feel protective, it's important not to let them become a way to completely hide from the world. Maybe try to view them as a temporary tool that helps you cope on harder days, rather than something you need to rely on constantly.

One moment everything feels manageable and exciting, the next it's like wearing anxiety-tinted glasses where everything looks terrifying and impossible. It's exhausting not knowing which version of yourself you'll wake up to.

Senior year is especially tough because there's so much uncertainty ahead. But here's something that helped me: Those moments of clarity and confidence you experience? That's actually your more rational self peeking through. The anxiety isn't showing you reality - it's showing you a distorted version of it.

Have you considered talking to your school's counseling services? They specifically deal with these transition periods and can give you tools to help stabilize those mood swings. Even just having someone to talk to who understands can make a huge difference.

In the meantime, try writing down how you feel during your good moments. When anxiety hits hard, reading your own words from a clearer headspace can help remind you that this feeling isn't permanent, even though it feels that way in the moment.

You're not drowning - you're learning to swim. It gets better with support and practice.","

Have you considered tracking these mood cycles in a simple journal? It might help you identify triggers and prepare for the down periods when they come. When I dealt with similar patterns, knowing they were temporary helped me hold on during the rough patches.

A few things that might help:
- Stick to a routine, especially during the low periods (even if it's just basic self-care)
- Get outside for a short walk daily, even when you don't feel like it
- Talk to your doctor - these patterns can sometimes be managed with professional help
- Be gentle with yourself - you're not wasting time, you're dealing with a real challenge

jroy1r,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,cry-b4by,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)",1526,101,1605028409,"I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I‚Äôm no sigmund freud but for me it‚Äôs definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I‚Äôm assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It‚Äôs only going to help. Best wishes and good luck!",180,adolescentd,Do you have ADHD? I have always been anxious and depressed but I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. The psych said my strong aversion to loud noises is from that.,1,xanaxhelps,"This is absolutely something worth bringing up with your therapist. Your reaction to yelling - even when it's not directed at you - is actually quite common, especially for sensitive people or those who've experienced stress/trauma (even if you can't pinpoint a specific cause).

The physical reactions you describe (flinching, tearfulness, tension) are your body's natural stress response kicking in. You don't need to have experienced direct trauma for your nervous system to be sensitive to confrontation and loud voices.

I have similar reactions myself, and what's helped me is learning grounding techniques (like deep breathing or the 5-4-3-2-1 method) to use in those moments. They help bring your nervous system back to baseline when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Definitely discuss this with your therapist - they can help you understand why you react this way and give you specific tools to manage these situations. There's nothing wrong with being sensitive to conflict, and you're not alone in feeling this way.

Wishing you the best with your upcoming therapy appointment! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It happens to me sometimes out of nowhere and in stressful situations. Like a wave washing over if that makes any sense. I feel it heavier around my arms. I have generalized anxiety disorder but idk how severe it is.,163,little-t007,"I overheat and start sweating. I've compared it to feeling like having stale adrenaline rushing through me and settling in my stomach. I get hot, like preemptive embarrassment. Adrenaline makes me want to move, do something, but I can't think, don't know what to do. Sometimes it makes me sick to my stomach.",29,AshleyIsSleeping,"Yes! I know exactly what you're describing - that cold ""wave"" that washes over you, almost like electricity running through your body. It's actually a very common physical response to anxiety, caused by your body's fight-or-flight response releasing adrenaline and other stress hormones.

Something that's helped me manage this is reminding myself that it's just my body trying to protect me, even though it's overreacting to a non-dangerous situation. Deep breathing (especially before situations you know might trigger it) can help reduce the intensity. Try taking slow breaths in through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 4, then out through your mouth for 4.

You're definitely not alone in this. Social anxiety affects millions of people, and that physical response you're describing is something many of us deal with. If it's significantly impacting your daily life, talking to a counselor can be really helpful - they can teach you specific techniques to manage these moments better.

Hang in there! It may not feel like it, but these reactions can get better with time and the right tools.","

I experience the exact same thing during high-stress periods - that frustrating contradiction of feeling physically hungry but having your body reject food at the same time.

Smoothies are actually a really smart choice when this happens. Other things that might help:
- Small, frequent snacks instead of full meals
- Bland foods like crackers, toast, or rice
- Cold foods which sometimes feel less overwhelming
- Protein shakes or meal replacement drinks

The physical symptoms of anxiety can really mess with your digestive system and trigger that fight-or-flight response that suppresses appetite. If this persists for more than a few days though, it might be worth checking in with your doctor just to be safe.

Hang in there! Try to be gentle with yourself and keep getting those nutrients in however you can, even if it's just through liquids for now. The appetite usually returns once the anxiety starts to settle.","

This kind of anxiety is actually pretty common, especially on days when our overall anxiety might be running higher than usual. Sometimes it helps to remind yourself that Reddit is basically a giant conversation where people are just sharing thoughts - perfect responses aren't required or expected.

Maybe try treating it like you're just talking to a friend? Or give yourself a 2-minute limit - if you haven't posted by then, just hit send anyway (unless it's something really controversial). The more you practice pushing through that anxiety wall, the easier it gets.

Here's something that helps me: most people are way too focused on their own lives and insecurities to spend much time judging yours. And honestly, vulnerability often makes people feel closer to you, not judgmental. Those who matter will appreciate your authenticity.

I've learned to reframe oversharing as being brave enough to be genuine. Sure, maybe we could dial it back sometimes, but beating yourself up about it only makes the anxiety worse. Try to be gentle with yourself - you're just someone trying to connect and be understood, and that's a very human thing.

Something that helps me is writing down key points before the call and reminding myself that the person on the other end probably makes/takes hundreds of calls a week - they're not analyzing my every word or judging my awkward pauses.

Also worth celebrating that you pushed through and made all three calls! Seriously, that's a win. Each time you do it, it gets a tiny bit easier, even if the initial dread never fully goes away. You're definitely not alone in this - there's a reason so many people prefer texting these days!","

hpaekj,Anxiety,Does anybody else find the sound of rain soothing?,ChampagneSupernovae,"When it rains (as it is doing so now), I always love to turn off my lights and lie in bed listening to it hit the roof or pavement outside. I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

There's something incredibly peaceful about the sound of rain, especially on a tin roof. It's like nature's white noise machine. Your description of that remote camp brought back similar memories for me - those simple moments without modern conveniences sometimes create the most lasting impressions.

It's heartbreaking when special places from our childhood change or disappear. But you know what's beautiful? The fact that the sound of rain can instantly transport you back there. Those memories are yours forever, and no logging company can take them away.

If you're looking to recreate some of that feeling, you might enjoy camping at state parks or national forests that still have that remote, peaceful vibe. It won't be exactly the same, but it could help capture that essence you miss. There are also some great rain sound apps that specifically feature rain on tin roofs - I use them sometimes when I can't sleep.

Keep cherishing those memories. They clearly shaped who you are and your appreciation for life's simple pleasures.","

Health anxiety can make our brains jump to the worst possible scenario, even in totally normal situations. It's like our mind is constantly running a ""what's the worst that could happen?"" program in the background.

Something that's helped me is the ""most likely explanation"" exercise. When I catch myself catastrophizing, I pause and ask ""What's the more mundane explanation here?"" Usually, it's exactly that - someone's making breakfast, not a medical emergency.

It's actually pretty common for anxiety to manifest this way. Our brains are trying to protect us by staying alert to danger, but sometimes they go a bit overboard. If these thoughts are really bothering you, there are some great CBT techniques specifically for health anxiety that can help rewire those automatic worst-case responses.

But hey, at least we can laugh about it together! There's something weirdly comforting about knowing others have the same anxious brain moments. üçû","

What helps me manage it:

- Preparing everything the night before (clothes, lunch, etc.) so morning stress is minimized
- Getting back to a normal sleep schedule a day or two before returning
- Taking 15 minutes to review my calendar and emails before my first day back so I feel more prepared
- Scheduling something enjoyable for my first day back (like lunch with a work friend or a favorite coffee)

Remember that this feeling usually passes once you're actually back in the swing of things. The anticipation is often worse than the reality. Be gentle with yourself - it's just your brain adjusting to the transition. Maybe plan a small treat or something to look forward to during your first day back?

It's completely normal to feel anxious during such uncertain times - we're all living through a pretty intense chapter of history right now. The constant news cycle and social media definitely don't help with the anxiety either.

Something that's helped me cope is focusing on what I can control. I make sure to vote, stay informed through reliable sources, and then try to step back from the constant news updates when it gets overwhelming. Maybe take some breaks from social media, go for walks, or spend time with friends and family talking about other things.

Remember that no matter what happens, we've gotten through difficult times before as a country. Try to take care of your mental health first - if the anxiety is really impacting you, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. There's no shame in getting support during stressful times.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Sending you positive thoughts and hoping we all get through this election period safely together. üôÇ","

iemc1z,Anxiety,can we TALK about anxiety poops jesus christ,littlefishlittletank,"sincerely, my ass is on fire.

No but seriously, I hate that with anxiety comes the diarrhea or bad poops and just the time wasted, which makes me more anxious. Especially if I have to be somewhere and I‚Äôm stuck on the toilet.

Anyone else get this? Or know why anxiety is so related to the digestive system?",1375,213,1598116525,"Yesss! It goes both ways for me - sometimes anxiety causes me to shit, and sometimes shitting gives me anxiety. I'm not super familiar with the why, but I did learn in college that there's a pretty significant relation between anxiety disorders and irritable bowel syndrome.",311,courtneat,"Yesss! It goes both ways for me - sometimes anxiety causes me to shit, and sometimes shitting gives me anxiety. I'm not super familiar with the why, but I did learn in college that there's a pretty significant relation between anxiety disorders and irritable bowel syndrome.",311,courtneat,"Oh man, anxiety poops are THE WORST. You're definitely not alone - there's actually a really strong connection between our gut and brain (scientists call it the ""gut-brain axis""). When you're anxious, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode, which messes with your digestive system and... well, you know the rest üò©

Some things that have helped me:
- Deep breathing exercises (I know it sounds clich√©, but it really helps calm your nervous system)
- Keeping Imodium on hand for especially important days
- Avoiding caffeine when anxious (it makes both anxiety AND poops worse)
- Planning extra time for bathroom breaks when I know I'll be stressed

The most frustrating part is definitely that cycle where you get anxious about having anxiety poops, which causes more anxiety poops. Try to remember it's a totally normal bodily response, even if it's super inconvenient.

If it's seriously impacting your life, talking to a doctor or therapist can help - they've heard it all before and won't judge!","

lscr39,Anxiety,Does anyone else end up not doing stuff because of their anxiety?,Fatkid1-22,"Im struggling with showing up to some stuff just because I get way too anxious beforehand.

I‚Äôm having an ok day but the second when I realise I have to go, I don‚Äôt do shit. I just sit on my ass all day. I hate this man. I can‚Äôt even get myself to go to the things I like to go to",1461,125,1614276357,Yes yes yes. I am deathly afraid to try something new. My anxiety has kept me from going to job interviews and therefor I am stuck in my job which I am miserable in and have been for the last eleven years. I can't even cook as I am afraid of failure and being laughed at and judged if I fail or do aomething wrong. Anxiety has literally effected every single aspect of my life in a horrible way. I am nearly 29 years old and I feel like my life has been wasted.,138,elbrando21,[removed],39,[deleted],"I know exactly what you're talking about - that paralyzing anxiety before events, even ones you know you'll enjoy. It's like your brain goes into full panic mode and suddenly staying home feels like the only safe option. You're definitely not alone in this.

Something that's helped me is breaking down the ""getting there"" part into tiny steps. Instead of thinking ""I have to go to this event,"" I think ""I just need to put my shoes on"" or ""I just need to walk to my car."" Each small step feels more manageable than the whole thing.

Also, try reminding yourself of past times when you pushed through and ended up having a good time. You mentioned that you actually enjoy yourself when you go - hold onto that truth when your anxiety is trying to convince you otherwise.

It's a tough cycle to break, but recognizing the pattern like you're doing is actually a really important first step. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can give you specific strategies for your situation. Either way, be proud of yourself for the times you do manage to go, and don't beat yourself up about the times you can't.","

I constantly ruminate on the things I‚Äôve said to my friends and I‚Äòm certain that I‚Äôve made myself look mean or stupid. After I go home from a hangout I get convinced that everyone secretly thinks I‚Äôm annoying and they‚Äôre only faking the friendship. 

Even if the hangout was fun for everyone, I always have these thoughts...",142,titaniumorbit,Sometimes even with friends anxiety hit me hard and I dissociate. That's fucking annoying because it's like I cant even enjoy being with my friends...,15,Adadidjo,"I feel this so deeply. That awful transition from ""wow, I had such a great time!"" to lying in bed analyzing every single interaction, convinced you somehow messed everything up... it's exhausting. The worst part is that your rational brain KNOWS these thoughts aren't real, but anxiety doesn't care about logic, does it?

Something that's helped me is reminding myself that people are generally way too focused on their own lives/insecurities to scrutinize our every move. Plus, think about when your friends make small social blunders - you probably barely notice or forget about it immediately, right? They likely view your perceived ""mistakes"" the same way.

I know it's easier said than done, but try to hold onto how you felt DURING those moments of fun, rather than letting anxiety rewrite the narrative afterward. Those genuine laughs and good vibes were real. Your anxiety is the liar here, not your initial experience.

You're not alone in this struggle. Anxiety is a jerk that tries to steal our joy, but we're stronger than it gives us credit for. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I fear any situation where there are no toilets for any significant amount of time (2 hours +),192,louiseoxford,"This is totally normal and I deal with it too! It's actually a pretty common form of anticipatory anxiety where focusing on ""not being able to go"" makes you hyper-aware of your bladder. The more you worry about it, the more your body seems to respond by actually making you need to go.

What's helped me:
- Going to the bathroom right before any situation where I know I'll have limited access
- Avoiding excess caffeine/drinks beforehand
- Using distraction techniques (games on phone, conversation, focusing on work) to get my mind off it
- Reminding myself that I've handled similar situations fine before
- Deep breathing exercises when I feel the anxiety building

The good news is that this is mostly psychological - your bladder capacity isn't actually smaller just because you're anxious. Try to break the mental cycle of ""I won't be able to go ‚Üí anxiety ‚Üí actually needing to go"" by staying occupied with other things.

You're definitely not alone in this! It's a super common anxiety that people don't talk about much.","

It's tough I know.",51,alemanimani,"I really relate to that Snakes & Ladders analogy - it perfectly captures how anxiety can send you sliding back down just when you think you're making progress. And that disconnect between appearing ""put together"" on the outside while dealing with internal chaos? I feel that deeply.

I love your perspective about making peace with anxiety rather than constantly fighting it. That's actually a really healthy approach that many therapists recommend - acceptance and learning to coexist rather than trying to eliminate it completely. It's like learning to dance with a challenging partner instead of trying to force them off the dance floor.

The imposter syndrome piece is so tough, but remember that those people who say you have your shit together aren't wrong - managing GAD while still achieving things is incredibly impressive. You're not an imposter, you're someone who accomplishes things DESPITE dealing with anxiety, which actually makes those accomplishments even more meaningful.

Keep being gentle with yourself on the harder days. Using Ativan when needed isn't a failure - it's just another tool in your anxiety management toolkit.","

It's like having an overprotective friend who means well but sometimes goes overboard. Our bodies developed these responses for survival, and they're doing exactly what they're designed to do - we're just in situations where that heightened response isn't always helpful.

I've found that showing myself compassion instead of frustration when anxiety hits actually helps reduce its intensity. Instead of ""ugh, not this again"" trying to think ""I understand you're trying to keep me safe, but we're okay right now.""

It's like being stuck in a vicious cycle - anxiety burns through your energy reserves, and then being tired makes you more prone to anxious thoughts. I've been there and it's exhausting both mentally and physically.

Your body is essentially in ""fight or flight"" mode constantly, which takes a massive toll on your energy levels. It's like running a marathon in your mind all day long.

While anxiety could definitely be the main culprit, it might be worth getting some basic bloodwork done just to rule out things like vitamin D deficiency or thyroid issues. But don't let waiting for test results stop you from working on anxiety management in the meantime.

Some things that helped me: establishing a solid bedtime routine, cutting back on caffeine (especially after noon), and learning basic breathing exercises. Therapy can also be incredibly helpful for breaking that anxiety-fatigue cycle.

hfk86k,Anxiety,Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?,[deleted],"Seriously, I don‚Äôt understand how people aren‚Äôt absolutely terrified of driving. You‚Äôre inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don‚Äôt hit someone. I hate when people tailgate me when I‚Äôm at the speed limit or slightly above. When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake.

Anyone else feel like this?",1307,272,1593083311,I definitely do. I still don't have a license. Just the thought of driving sends my anxiety way up.

Driving anxiety is way more common than most people realize, and everything you described - the fear of accidents, the pressure from other drivers, the constant awareness of danger - it's all completely valid.

What helped me was reframing driving as a skill that can be improved, rather than just a scary situation I'm thrown into. Some things that made a difference:
- Taking defensive driving courses to feel more confident
- Starting with quiet routes during off-peak hours to build comfort
- Using breathing techniques when feeling overwhelmed
- Reminding myself that modern cars have extensive safety features
- Accepting that I can drive at a pace I'm comfortable with (as long as it's reasonable)

You're not alone in feeling this way. While the risks you mentioned are real, millions of people complete their drives safely each day. It's okay to be cautious - that often makes you a better driver than the overconfident ones! Consider talking to a therapist who specializes in driving anxiety if it's significantly impacting your life. They can provide specific strategies to help manage these fears.","

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well",1445,130,1549493472,"Yeah it‚Äôs so weird. Whenever I have that confidence boost I wonder how I couldn‚Äôt have it. How easy it feels to be confident.

Then after a day I‚Äôm on the other side and I can‚Äôt imagine feeling confident. ",308,GriddleMyFiddle,"This is one of the reasons why Anxiety is classified as a disorder. Those of us with anxiety and other things like depression and panic ect... it is caused by the inability for our brains to regulate chemical processes. So with anxiety and panic, our Amygdala is pretty fucked up. The amygdala is incharge of regulating norepinephrine ( the stress signal), dopamine, serotonin, Adrenalin and cortisol. When the Amygdala cant regulate properly it either, sends to much or not enough of these chemicals, and it never happens like clock work. One day we will get too much, then the next fived days not enough and the next 4 days not enough and the next too much ect... its not a perfect pattern.. if it was... we would probably be better able to adapt to our ""regular"" cycles. 

&amp;#x200B;

So With us.. we have to remember and learn about how our unique, malfunctioning brain works.. If you feel on top of the world for a day, after a long haul of feeling like shit, remember that you will experience a crash eventually, But Dont pout about it, its just biology, our brains and bodies are not used to the amount of dopamine and serotonin production that the amygdala is giving off that day or week that we feel on top of the world, This will result in a crash, where we feel tired,and it will probably go back to producing to much cortisol, which is what happens when normal people are tired. Tired people are stressed and depressed. It is an annoying vicious cycle, i do not wish upon anyone, but what really helped me was being able to listen and know my body... 

On those days that you feel high in the sky, observe what is happening, and observe that fact that you are not used to it, so you will crash, and you must enjoy the ride. Be prepared for the next days to come.

It sucks, but it is not a hopeless cause. If you really try, you can help calm the shit out of your own brain. I have done it. I will never be completely cured of  depression or anxiety, Everyone feels anxious  and depressed at times because this is natural, what you want to cure is the anxiety or depression you feel when you cannot think of a reason why. Once you have done that, You can move onto curing more specific things like social anxiety, chronic stress, activities or memories that give you depression or anxiety.

I wont put all of the specifics, because if you want to help yourself you are going to look up each of these things.  ( I am putting the ones that I have tried that worked at the top) Things to help you heal your amygdala are:

atleast 15- 20 minuets of sunlight per day

Meditate and stretch. ( yoga or not stretch your body) 

Diet change ( their are specific foods that do not help and can even cause depression and stress, its not the food specifically that causes it, it is what that food does to the body which domino effects to your brain. You basically have a brain in your stomach, many people call the stomach ""the second brain"" when in fact it should be the first brain, your stomach has a larger neural network then the brains in our head do, so when you are choosing food to eat, remember that what you feed your belly, you are feeding to your brain.)

Good nights sleep

10 min nap in the middle of the day

Water- Drink it, Swim, take baths, showers, put your feet in it or watch it. Water is therapeutic.

Switching up your routine, ( or getting a routine, if you are like me that was not a thing before)

Get a hobby.

Exercise ( I hate working out, but what helped me was at that moment which I started to feel like shit, panic, anxious, depressed, I would walk it out, Even run up and down the stairs, when we are active our brains produce special chemicals that sort of override the stress hormones and lack of serotonin and dopamine) 

Getting a pet and\\or having plants in your house ( again if you like me and have trouble keeping plant alive, choose succulents. Plants bring good chi, especially if you dont go outside very much to be around plants, having them in the place where you are most often helps you ).

The best thing I ever did for myself  to heal Panic disorder and anxiety, that I never thought of until I started Cognitive behavioral Therapy ( on my own, no money required)  was when I learned that I need to insert my self into settings and situations that I would otherwise not, As in do shit that gives me anxiety. For example I am scared to death of heights, So I went free climbing with my boyfriend in a canyon, yes I did cry on the way down, and no I did not look down when I got to the top of the maybe 50 feet we climbed, but there was this weird thing that happened, where I felt like I could do that again, and thinking about what I did didnt bring me anxiety&gt; I repeatedly did this. I have social anxiety, and I inserted my self into social situations, slowly at first, but last weekend I stayed out of my room for an entire party my roomates had, there was NO retreating. I took a job in a city 20 mins away from house, which I have to drive through a snowy canyon to get too... Do I have driving anxiety anymore? Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my last drug I will prescribe you.

Change. Change up your life, like your day to day routine, change stuff. There was a study they did with school kids that showed when the kids change which side of the classroom they sit in every day it helps them learn better, Basically not changing where you sit, creates a sort of comfort and familiarity, lessening attention. When we change up our lives often, we crawl out of the comfort zone, things that were unfamiliar and anxiety ridden before, become more friendly to us. When we change things, we create more energy, we are tired less often, and less fatigue means less depression, less stress, less anxiety. 

Change your life, and you will really change your life. 

Take it slow, remember that you are human and humans are a mystery to this world. We are powerful machines, and Mind over Matter does exist. Do not fall into this preconceived notion that you have a problem that can only be fixed by medications and doctors.. most of the time, that is not true. Take the steps to help your self first, and if you really just cannot do it, then spend the money on a therapist.. But in all honesty, we are our own best therapists.

 ",61,s0nder369thOughts,"I'm really glad you went to get professional help - that takes a lot of courage and is a huge first step. What you're describing definitely sounds like it could be bipolar II with those distinct mood shifts between hypomania and depression. You're absolutely not alone in this.

The good news is that bipolar II is very treatable with the right combination of medication and therapy. While it can feel really destabilizing to go through those extreme ups and downs, understanding what's happening and getting proper treatment can help smooth things out significantly.

Don't beat yourself up about those confidence crashes either. They're not a reflection of your worth - they're symptoms of a medical condition that can be managed. Keep working with mental health professionals to develop a treatment plan that works for you.

And remember, this community is here to support you. Many of us have been through similar experiences and understand what you're going through. Take care of yourself, and keep reaching out when you need to. üíú","

POST TITLE: Anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?

POST BODY: Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. 

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well

The moment one concern is resolved, it immediately scans for the next thing to latch onto. It's exhausting.

What helped me understand this better was learning that this is actually a common anxiety pattern called ""floating anxiety."" Your brain gets used to being in ""alert mode"" and feels uncomfortable when it's not actively worrying about something.

A few things that have helped me:
- Acknowledging that this is my anxiety talking, not reality
- Meditation (even just 5 mins) to practice letting thoughts pass by
- Writing down my worries to see patterns and challenge them
- Reminding myself that I've handled past worries successfully

It's definitely possible to reduce this mental habit, though it takes time and practice. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can give you specific tools to help break this cycle.

Hang in there - you're not alone in this, and it can get better! üíú","

hd78e8,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù their anxiety disorder?,[deleted],"As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i‚Äôve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues.

There was also a lot of flux and change in my life (military family.)

Many people come to realize how their parents' behavior, even if unintentional, has impacted their mental health. It's actually a sign of growth that you can recognize these patterns and their effects on you.

It's possible to both appreciate what your parents have done for you AND feel angry about the ways they've hurt you. These feelings aren't mutually exclusive. Your disclaimer shows you're approaching this thoughtfully, not just playing victim.

What helped me work through similar feelings was therapy - having a professional help me understand these complex emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It can also help you set better boundaries with your mom while maintaining a relationship, if that's what you want.

Consider that your mom might be dealing with her own unresolved anxiety that she unfortunately passed down. This doesn't excuse her behavior, but understanding it might help reduce some of that internal rage.

Focus on what you can control now - seeking help, developing self-compassion, and building the emotional toolkit your parents couldn't give you. You're already showing great self-awareness by addressing this.","

I've found it helpful to have a few trusted people at work/school who understand my anxiety and can be my go-to support when things get rough. For everyone else, I'm selective about what I share, not because we should have to hide, but because protecting our own wellbeing sometimes means choosing our battles.

You made a great point about the diabetes comparison. Mental health symptoms are just as real and valid as physical ones, even if they're less visible. The ""we all have days like that"" dismissal is particularly frustrating because it minimizes the difference between regular stress and an actual disorder.

Keep advocating for yourself and leaning on those supportive family members and friends. You're absolutely right that this stigma needs to change, and having these conversations is an important part of making that happen. Your struggles are valid, whether they're visible to others or not.","

I experience something very similar - it's like there's this weird mental barrier around starting new shows or books, even though I know I'll probably enjoy them once I actually begin.

What's helped me is starting small - like watching just one episode or reading just one chapter with zero pressure to continue. I also give myself permission to stop if I'm not feeling it. Sometimes I'll even put on a new show while doing something low-key like folding laundry, so it feels less like a ""commitment.""

The comfort of familiar shows is totally valid too - they're predictable and don't require emotional energy. Maybe try mixing in new content gradually while keeping your comfort shows in rotation. Remember that entertainment should be enjoyable, not another source of pressure.

Try to take note of what helped make today successful for you. Was it something in your routine? Your mindset? The activities you did or didn't do? Understanding these patterns can help you have more good days in the future.

And remember that even if tomorrow isn't as good as today, this proves that you CAN have anxiety-free days. You've done it once, and you can do it again. Progress isn't always linear, but you're clearly moving in the right direction.

Fingers crossed!,52,[deleted],"This is amazing - what a huge win! As someone who also deals with interview anxiety, I know exactly how much courage it took to push through those pre-interview jitters, especially with the added pressure of having to demonstrate language skills.

The fact that you not only went through with it but absolutely crushed it (impressing the native German speaker?! That's huge!) shows that you're way more capable than your anxiety wants you to believe. Even if this particular job doesn't work out, you've proven to yourself that you can handle these situations like a boss.

Keep this experience in your back pocket for the next time anxiety tries to talk you out of something important. You've got solid evidence now that pushing through the fear can lead to awesome results.

Fingers crossed that you get the job - those benefits sound incredible! But regardless of the outcome, you should be really proud of yourself. This is a major personal victory! üéâ","

That feeling of being watched can be really uncomfortable and make you feel self-conscious about even the most basic tasks.

I've noticed that most people who do this usually don't realize how intrusive it feels to the person being watched. They might think they're just being social or showing interest, but they don't understand it can feel like pressure or judgment, even if that's not their intent.

What's helped me is being direct but casual about it: ""Hey, I get really distracted when people watch me do stuff - mind giving me some space?"" Most reasonable people will understand once you frame it that way. If they keep doing it after you've explained, it's okay to be more firm about your boundary.

You're definitely not alone in this! It's a pretty common source of anxiety for many people, and you have every right to ask for personal space while you're doing things.","

Nah fuck that. I'd retire young and never look back",315,Maelis,[deleted],5,[deleted],"I feel this in my soul. The constant notifications, endless meetings, and dealing with difficult personalities can be completely overwhelming - especially when you're already dealing with anxiety. It's totally valid to feel burned out by the whole corporate hamster wheel.

Have you considered looking into roles that might better match your working style? Some positions have more independent work and fewer meetings/interruptions. Or maybe exploring part-time or contract work to have more control over your schedule.

In the meantime, setting boundaries has helped me a lot - blocking focus time on my calendar, turning off notifications during deep work, and being clear about realistic deadlines. Also, therapy gave me some great tools for managing work-related anxiety.

I know ""just quit"" isn't realistic for most of us who need income to survive. But remember you're not alone in feeling this way. The corporate world can be soul-crushing sometimes, and it's okay to acknowledge that while working on making your situation more bearable.","

Sometimes we forget that the smallest acts of survival are actually huge victories. Getting out of bed when depression is crushing you, making that phone call despite anxiety screaming at you not to, or just continuing to exist when everything feels overwhelming - these are all acts of courage that deserve recognition.

I've learned that healing isn't linear, and some days just managing the basics is enough. We don't have to accomplish great things every day to be worthy. Simply choosing to keep going, to face another day despite the weight we carry, that's incredibly powerful.

To anyone reading this who's struggling right now: I see you. Your battle might be invisible to others, but that doesn't make it any less real or valid. You're fighting hard battles every single day, and the fact that you're still here, still trying, still pushing forward - that makes you a warrior in my book.

Keep holding on. Keep being gentle with yourself. And remember that surviving is sometimes the bravest thing we can do.","

I used to constantly create these elaborate ""what-if"" scenarios in my head, turning minor things into full-blown disaster movies where everything goes wrong. It's like our brains are really good at writing anxiety-inducing fanfiction about our own lives.

What helped me was learning to catch myself when I start spiraling into these hypotheticals. I ask myself: ""Is this actually happening right now? What evidence do I have that this will happen?"" Usually, I realize I'm worrying about something that's not just unlikely, but sometimes completely impossible.

A technique that works for me is grounding myself in the present moment. When I notice I'm creating these scenarios, I focus on five things I can see, four I can touch, three I can hear, etc. It helps pull me out of those imaginary situations and back to reality.

Remember, having an active imagination isn't bad - it's just about learning to direct that energy somewhere more productive. Maybe try channeling it into creative writing or problem-solving for actual situations you're facing?","

You need a job to move forward, but the whole process feels overwhelming, which makes it harder to take action, which then increases the anxiety... and round and round it goes.

What helped me was breaking it down into tiny, manageable steps. Like, maybe today you just update one section of your resume. Tomorrow, you bookmark 3 interesting job posts. Next day, you draft one cover letter. No pressure to submit anything yet - just baby steps.

Also, try reframing interviews as two-way conversations. You're also evaluating if the company is right for YOU. Sometimes that mental shift can take some pressure off.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? Many offer sliding scale payments, and they can give you specific tools to manage job-search anxiety. Plus, having someone in your corner while you navigate this can make a huge difference.

Remember, you're not alone in this. So many people struggle with job search anxiety - it's completely normal and valid to feel this way.","

It's so easy to get caught up in our own self-criticism and forget to acknowledge how far we've actually come. We're often our own harshest critics, focusing on what we haven't achieved rather than celebrating our progress.

Sometimes it feels like everyone else has it all figured out while we're struggling, but that's rarely the truth. Most people are dealing with their own doubts and challenges - we just don't see that part of their lives.

I've learned that on days when I feel like I'm falling behind, it helps to write down what I've accomplished in the past year, no matter how small those wins might seem. Usually, I surprise myself with how many things I've actually achieved or overcome.

So to anyone reading this who's being hard on themselves today: Take a deep breath. You're growing, learning, and moving forward, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Progress isn't always visible in the day-to-day, but when you look back, you'll see just how far you've come.","

pfyhok,Anxiety,Does your Anxiety manifest itself in stomach pain or digestive problems?,Almighty_Sand_Dollar,"I have dealt with anxiety for so many years now and in the last 5 years especially I've noticed that I just get knots or like IBS in certain situations (relationships, high stress work stuff, etc) and it affects my appetite or mood.",1265,286,1630516702,That's where my anxiety lives!,318,N1414,That's where my anxiety lives!,318,N1414,"Yes, what you're describing is incredibly common with anxiety! The gut-brain connection is very real - our digestive system is often called our ""second brain"" because it's so closely linked to our mental state. I dealt with similar symptoms for years before realizing it was anxiety-related.

Some things that have helped me manage these physical symptoms:
- Deep breathing exercises, especially when I feel the stomach issues starting
- Peppermint tea or ginger tea during stressful periods
- Regular exercise (even just walking) to help process stress hormones
- Keeping a food/mood journal to identify trigger situations

You might want to look into ""somatic anxiety"" - it's when anxiety manifests primarily as physical symptoms. A therapist can help you develop specific coping strategies. Also, don't hesitate to talk to your doctor about it, as they can rule out other issues and possibly suggest treatments that could help both the anxiety and digestive symptoms.

Remember you're not alone in this - the gut-anxiety connection affects tons of people. It's great that you're aware of the connection and seeking support!","

Something that helped me was realizing that this ""running out of time"" feeling is often a symptom of being stuck in our heads rather than living in the present. When we're constantly worried about not doing enough, we actually make it harder to do anything at all.

Try this: Set aside 5 minutes today to just breathe and notice your surroundings. No judgment, no pressure to ""do"" anything. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but it's a small step toward breaking that anxiety cycle.

Also, remember that you can't change the past, but you absolutely can give yourself a chance now. The fact that you're aware of these feelings and reaching out shows you're already taking steps forward.

But I can share some perspective on why teachers do this - it's usually not to torture students, but to ensure everyone stays engaged and to check if the material is actually being understood by the whole class, not just the frequent hand-raisers.

That said, if this is causing you serious anxiety, it's completely valid to have a private conversation with your teacher about it. Most teachers want to help their students succeed, not cause panic attacks. You could say something like ""I'm really struggling with being called on unexpectedly. Could we work out a different way for me to show my participation?""

Some teachers will let you write responses instead, or give you a heads-up before calling on you so you can prepare. The key is communicating your needs respectfully.

Remember, it's okay not to know every answer. Teachers should be creating a safe space for learning, not making students feel terrible for being unsure.","

They're often called ""imaginary arguments"" or ""mental arguments"" and lots of people experience them.

A few things that helped me:
- Catching yourself when it starts and consciously redirecting your thoughts (it takes practice!)
- Reminding yourself ""this isn't real and I'm causing myself unnecessary stress""
- Deep breathing or going for a quick walk to break the thought pattern
- Writing down what's bothering you instead of letting it loop in your head

Often these imaginary arguments come from real underlying worries or unresolved conflicts. Maybe try to identify what's actually making you anxious? Sometimes just understanding the root cause helps reduce how often they happen.

Be gentle with yourself though - your brain is just trying to ""prepare"" you for potential conflicts, even if it's not doing it in a helpful way. The fact that you're aware of it and wanting to change it is already a great first step.","

I love your point about animals - it's so true! Watch any cat or dog and you'll see they naturally balance activity with rest. They don't feel bad about taking a nap in the sun, and neither should we.

Something that helped me reframe this was realizing that rest isn't the opposite of productivity - it's actually an essential part of it. Just like athletes need recovery days for their muscles to get stronger, our brains and bodies need downtime to process, heal, and prepare for the next challenge.

Thanks for this reminder. I think a lot of us needed to hear it, especially in a culture that sometimes seems to glorify hustle and grind above all else.","

POST TITLE: Just a reminder that relaxing IS productive.

POST BODY: If you do not recharge your batteries, then you won't do so well later.

Every animal relaxes, the other animals spend way more time relaxing than us humans. 

It is good for your body and mind. It is something we *need*.

So please do not feel guilty about relaxing. That thing you have to do can wait. And when you're done relaxing, you'll do that thing way better than if you hadn't relaxed.

I hope you all have a great day. :)

doz3zc,Anxiety,Anyone else have constant anxiety rather than attacks?,how-to-username,"I hear a lot of people with anxiety talk about having anxiety attacks or panic attacks, but it‚Äôs never really been that way with me. I just seem to constantly be on edge with everything, even small stuff, and every once in a while I‚Äôll have ‚Äúwaves‚Äù of increased anxiety for a few days. Does anyone else have mild or moderate stress at all times instead of actual anxiety attacks?",1350,195,1572395522,"Completely my experience. I have panic attacks sometimes but rarely, though when I do have them they're catastrophically bad.

Mine is more as you said, constantly being on edge and sometimes I'll have waves of panic that makes my whole body clench up, my mind races and I get cold. I also constantly focus  on random bodily feelings, aches or pains and worry I'm dying. Good times.",442,Monechetti,You ever try cbd ?,1,talkingwithmasses,"Yes, what you're describing is absolutely valid and common! It's called Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), where you experience persistent worry and tension rather than acute panic attacks. I deal with this too - it's like having your stress dial constantly set to 6/10 instead of jumping between 1 and 10.

Some things that have helped me manage this ""background anxiety"":
- Regular exercise, even just walking
- Mindfulness practices (not necessarily meditation, but just checking in with yourself)
- Having a consistent sleep schedule
- Cutting back on caffeine
- Writing down worries to get them out of your head

It might be worth talking to a mental health professional if you haven't already. They can provide strategies specifically tailored to managing persistent anxiety.

Just remember you're not alone in this. While panic attacks get more attention, many of us deal with this constant ""hum"" of anxiety. It's equally valid and deserving of support and treatment. Hang in there! üíú","

I have no idea but I hate it.",17,shady764567,"Don't feel guilty at all! I totally get what you mean about the relief of not having that social pressure this year. NYE can feel really overwhelming with all the expectations to have THE MOST AMAZING TIME EVER and be surrounded by people, even when you genuinely love spending time with friends and family.

It's completely normal and healthy to appreciate a break from social obligations sometimes. Just because you're enjoying the quieter celebration doesn't mean you value your relationships any less. Think of it as giving yourself permission to celebrate in a way that actually feels good to you, rather than what you feel you ""should"" be doing.

Maybe this is a good opportunity to start new traditions that better align with what you truly enjoy - whether that's a cozy night in with movies, a small dinner with just your closest people, or even a peaceful solo evening of reflection. There's no wrong way to welcome the new year!","

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know exactly how a ""simple"" task like going to the post office can feel overwhelming. Our brains have this frustrating way of turning basic errands into these huge, scary scenarios.

You should absolutely feel proud of yourself! Each time we push through anxiety and realize ""hey, that wasn't nearly as bad as I thought,"" it makes the next challenge a little easier to face. I love that you had support from your boyfriend too - sometimes just having someone validate our feelings while gently encouraging us makes a huge difference.

One thing that helps me is keeping a little note in my phone of these ""anxiety wins"" - times when I faced something scary and it turned out fine. On tough days, it reminds me that my anxiety lies to me and that I'm more capable than my fears suggest.

The cycle of anxiety preventing you from getting help for anxiety is something many people struggle with - you're not alone in this.

Here's something that might help: many therapists now offer online sessions where you don't have to leave your apartment or even make a phone call - you can often schedule everything through email or their website. It's a much gentler first step than traditional in-person therapy.

For now, try breaking things down into tiny, manageable pieces. Don't think about the whole job search - maybe just spend 10 minutes updating one section of your resume. Don't worry about all your clothes - pick just one item to order online. You don't have to fix everything at once.

You're not pathetic - you're someone going through a really tough time who's reaching out for help. That takes courage. If you want to talk more about online therapy options or small steps you can take, feel free to DM me.","

I get a surge of adrenaline when my phone pings, and my hands are shaking by the time I pick it up. Having my ringer off makes me even more anxious because I don't know when someone has texted or called. Especially when texting my SO. There's no reason to have anxiety texting him but I always do. I am not even worried for a reason and yet my hands shake so much I can barely type.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself. I used to miss school because I would get so sick from anxiety in the morning. Does anyone else have their anxiety give them an upset stomach?",1389,141,1613887097,Yes. Mental health symptoms are known to also appear as gastrointestinal symptoms. The mind and the stomach are surprisingly very much related.,235,[deleted],,0,,"Yes, what you're describing is incredibly common with anxiety! The gut-brain connection is very real - our digestive system is actually full of nerve endings that respond to stress and anxiety. I dealt with the exact same symptoms throughout college, especially the morning nausea before events.

Some things that helped me:
- Taking slow deep breaths when I feel the stomach symptoms starting
- Sipping peppermint or ginger tea
- Having a very light, bland breakfast on anxious days
- Gradually exposing myself to anxiety-triggering situations in small doses
- Working with a therapist who specialized in anxiety

For the phone anxiety specifically, maybe you could set custom notification sounds for your SO versus others? That way you know it's them without the same adrenaline spike.

Please know you're not alone in this. Anxiety manifests physically for so many people, and the stomach issues can be really rough. If you haven't already, consider talking to a doctor or therapist about it. There are lots of treatment options that can help manage both the mental and physical symptoms.","

Getting to sleep is hard on a good day, and even harder for me these days. Sadly, the lack of sleep only fuels my anxiety and it feels like a hopeless cycle. 

Does anyone else experience very heightened anxiety at night? If so, what remedies have you found that worked to get you sleeping through the night? Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: 
Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I‚Äôm truly touched by everyone‚Äôs suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I‚Äôve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I‚Äôll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating ‚Äúworry time‚Äù and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren‚Äôt sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this.",1383,146,1609645282,"My anxiety is definitely worse at nighttime. If I know I have something to do the next day that makes me anxious, then I'll just set myself up for success by limiting alcohol (like max of 1 low abv beer, preferably none), take melatonin,  set out my clothes/ pack my stuff for work, etc.  Mostly try to eliminate anything to make me fret.

Then I scroll reddit/ comment threads until my eyes are sleepy and fall asleep. I have to have something to distract me from my anxious thoughts or the cyclic thoughts take over. 

Good luck.  Nights are the worst!!!",138,kittenmom,"Unfortunately I have no remedies, but I struggle with this often. I‚Äôm usually alright, at least functional during the day and then night time hits and I‚Äôm a mess",27,nmnf0518,"I totally relate to this struggle, especially during these dark winter months. Nighttime anxiety is actually super common - our minds tend to race more when everything gets quiet and we're alone with our thoughts.

One thing that's really helped me is creating a ""wind-down zone"" about an hour before bed. I dim the lights, put on some low-fi music or nature sounds, and do something gentle like light stretching or reading (actual books, not my phone). I also keep a journal by my bed - when anxious thoughts start spiraling, writing them down helps get them out of my head.

I noticed you already have a great list of suggestions! From personal experience, the weighted blanket and limiting caffeine after 2pm were game-changers for me. Also, on really tough nights, I use the ""5-4-3-2-1"" grounding technique: naming 5 things I can see, 4 I can touch, 3 I can hear, 2 I can smell, and 1 I can taste. It helps break that anxiety loop and brings me back to the present moment.

You're definitely not alone in this. Be patient with yourself - finding the right combination of tools takes time, but it's worth it. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

kssgs6,Anxiety,Do you think it's fair to say the past year has been traumatic?,tomorrowistomato,"I feel permanently changed by everything that's happened this past year. I am exhausted. I feel bitter and angry and sad. I have never hated people the way I do now. There are times that I feel like going outside and just screaming at the sky until I can't anymore. And I feel gaslit by the people around me who want to pretend that nothing is wrong. 

I'm very lucky that the events of this year haven't had a huge direct impact on me - I have a job and a place to live, my loved ones are alive.

It's absolutely valid to feel traumatized even if you weren't directly impacted by major losses. Witnessing widespread suffering, dealing with constant uncertainty, and experiencing such massive societal disruption can absolutely be traumatic.

The emotional exhaustion and anger you're describing are actually really normal responses to abnormal circumstances. And it's especially frustrating when others seem to minimize or dismiss the gravity of everything that's happened.

One thing that helped me was realizing that it's okay to not be okay right now. You don't have to force yourself to ""get over it"" or bounce back immediately. Consider talking to a therapist if you can - they can help provide tools for processing these complex emotions.

In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. It's okay to take breaks from news and social media, to rest when you need to, and to feel whatever you're feeling. This has been a collectively traumatic time, and healing happens gradually. Your feelings are completely valid and understandable.","

POST TITLE: Do you think it's fair to say the past year has been traumatic?

POST BODY: I feel permanently changed by everything that's happened this past year. I am exhausted. I feel bitter and angry and sad. I have never hated people the way I do now. There are times that I feel like going outside and just screaming at the sky until I can't anymore. And I feel gaslit by the people around me who want to pretend that nothing is wrong. 

I'm very lucky that the events of this year haven't had a huge direct impact on me - I have a job and a place to live, my loved ones are alive. But it feels like everything else is just a giant fucking nightmare. All I want to do is sleep and pretend I don't exist. I don't think I'm ever going to be completely okay after this, even if things do someday become ""normal"" again, whatever that even means.

971qny,Anxiety,I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,saberToothedCat,"SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you.",1436,88,1534191305,[deleted],90,[deleted],[deleted],90,[deleted],"This is awesome, man! What you did takes serious guts, and the fact that you're focusing on the win of putting yourself out there rather than dwelling on the rejection shows amazing emotional maturity.

Your edit about exposure therapy is spot-on too. Each time you face these uncomfortable situations, you're building emotional resilience. Think of it like working out - the first few times are tough, but it gets easier as you build that ""muscle.""

The fact that she was polite and you handled it well means you both made it a positive interaction. That's honestly the best possible outcome for a rejection scenario. Now you know you can survive asking someone out and getting a ""no"" - that knowledge is powerful.

Keep challenging yourself and putting yourself in those uncomfortable situations. Your psychologist is giving you solid advice. And hey, next time you're interested in someone, you'll be able to look back on this experience and know you've got it in you to take that shot.

Proud of you, dude! üëä","

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it‚Äôs nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it‚Äôs impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything.

Not being acknowledged for how and what we feel leaves people like me disappointed and upset at myself.,110,weedynaddys98,,0,,"I totally get this feeling. That sudden self-doubt that creeps in when you're sharing something you're genuinely excited about is so frustrating. It's like your brain hits this switch from ""I want to share this cool thing!"" to ""Oh god, I'm probably boring them to death.""

But here's the thing - passion is attractive and interesting. When someone is genuinely excited about something, even if it's not my particular interest, their enthusiasm makes the story engaging. Those detailed driving directions weren't just about turns and roads - they were about a special place that brings you peace and happiness.

Next time that self-doubt creeps in, try to remember that sharing these personal experiences is how we connect with people. The right people will appreciate seeing this side of you, even if they don't share the same passion. And if someone makes you feel bad about being enthusiastic about something that brings you joy? That's more of a reflection on them than on you.

Keep sharing what lights you up. The world needs more genuine enthusiasm, not less.","

As someone who deals with anxiety, it really does feel like your threat-detection system is stuck in overdrive, constantly alerting you to ""dangers"" that aren't actually there. Your brain is trying to protect you, just like Spider-Sense, but it's being way too zealous about it.

The tricky part is learning to distinguish between legitimate warnings and false alarms. Something that's helped me is reminding myself that just because my anxiety is triggering doesn't mean there's actually a threat - it's just Peter Parker's spider-sense going haywire at a perfectly normal Tuesday afternoon.

Working with a therapist can help you ""recalibrate"" those senses and develop better tools for managing when they get overwhelming. In the meantime, be gentle with yourself. Your brain is trying its best to keep you safe, even if it's being a bit overeager about it.

It's like waiting for the other shoe to drop when things are going well. I've struggled with this too - that nagging voice that says ""don't get too comfortable, something bad is coming.""

But I've learned that this mindset actually robs us of enjoying the good moments when we have them. Life will always have ups and downs - that's just how it works. But denying ourselves happiness in the good times doesn't protect us from the bad times, it just means we miss out twice.

Try to practice staying present and letting yourself feel joy without the ""what if"" thoughts. When those anxious thoughts come up, acknowledge them but remind yourself that you deserve to experience happiness fully. Each good moment is valid on its own, regardless of what might come later.

Also, this is a really common feeling - you're definitely not alone in this. Sometimes just knowing that others struggle with the same thing can make it easier to work through it.","

For astronomy - start small! Download a stargazing app, watch some YouTube videos, or just lay outside and look at the stars. You don't need fancy equipment or credentials to appreciate the cosmos.

The irony is that by overthinking how to spend our free time, we rob ourselves of actually enjoying it. Try giving yourself permission to just BE for a while without judgment. Your worth isn't measured by how you spend your leisure time.

And remember - your identity isn't some fixed destination you need to reach. It's fluid and evolves with you. Those ""wasted"" days of figuring yourself out? That IS part of being who you are.","

They might be having a terrible day, dealing with personal issues, or maybe they're just someone who never learned to manage their emotions well. That doesn't make their behavior okay, but it helps take the sting out of it.

When I catch myself replaying the scene and thinking of comebacks, I try to consciously redirect my thoughts: ""This person doesn't deserve any more of my mental energy today."" Sometimes I even imagine physically brushing their negativity off my shoulders.

I've been there - that terrifying feeling where you question your own grip on reality and worry you're literally losing your mind. It's one of anxiety's cruelest tricks.

Here's what helped me understand it better: These feelings, while incredibly distressing, are actually a normal symptom of anxiety and panic. The intense fear and disconnected feeling can make us question our sanity, but the very fact that you're aware enough to worry about it suggests you're still very much in touch with reality.

Some things that helped me:
- Reminding myself that this is anxiety, not actual psychosis
- Grounding exercises (5-4-3-2-1 method really helps)
- Talking to a therapist who explained the science behind panic symptoms
- Understanding that thousands of others experience this exact same fear

You're not going crazy - you're experiencing severe anxiety. It's scary as hell, but it's temporary and treatable. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. They can provide tools to help manage these overwhelming feelings.","

Thankfully it was the first symptom to disappear when I started my SSRI but for like half my life, man...and it often resembled the stomach flu, just endless hours in the bathroom in the middle of the night anxious to the point of sickness. Especially during finals in school, the week before and the week of. Not conducive towards being a productive human being. I once had to bail on most of my accounting final because the professor banned us from leaving the room for any reason and I suddenly *had* to go - I threw the exam on her desk and bolted from the room as fast as I could, barely made it in time. I've puked in my fair share of trash cans and bushes.

Peppermint or ginger tea can help. Anxious nausea is typically due to an overproduction of acid so antacids can help. For a portable option you can try Seabands, they're marketed for motion sickness but work pretty well for anxious nausea. And Tummydrops are good to keep in your pocket at all times - they come in ten flavors at varying intensities, you can get them on Amazon.",131,larki18,Yep. I have nervous poops all the time and can expect at least one explosive poop a day. It sucks.,7,nomotaco,"You are definitely not alone in this! The gut-brain connection is very real, and anxiety can wreak absolute havoc on your digestive system. I deal with the exact same issues - it's like my stomach is a direct radar for my stress levels.

Have you looked into seeing a gastroenterologist who understands the anxiety-IBS connection? Mine helped me develop a management plan that includes both anxiety coping techniques and gut health strategies. Deep breathing exercises and gentle yoga actually help calm both my nerves and my stomach.

The vicious cycle you described is the worst - feeling anxious makes your stomach hurt, then worrying about your stomach makes you more anxious. It can feel never-ending. Something that helped me break that cycle was keeping a symptom diary to identify my triggers and patterns.

Hang in there. It's frustrating and exhausting to deal with both anxiety and IBS, but there are ways to manage it. Be gentle with yourself - you're dealing with two challenging conditions at once. You've got this, and this community is here to support you! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

POST TITLE: Anyone else get horrible gastric problems from their anxiety?

POST BODY: I already have IBS in my family (yay, me), but I‚Äôve found that my anxiety makes my stomach problems so much worse. It‚Äôs constant off-and-on problems with cramping, gas, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes outright pain. Sometimes I‚Äôll get a jolt of nerves and the suddenly I have horrible stomach pain. Other times I just feel mildly sick. It doesn‚Äôt even matter what I eat, nothing seems to help. It can be really discouraging and debilitating. When my anxiety is higher, it always makes these problems WAY worse. Then the vicious cycle begins and it gives me MORE anxiety. 

Am I alone in this? I hate anxiety!

mv6ys1,Anxiety,I PASSED MY DANG DRIVERS LICENSE TEST TODAY AND SO CAN YOU,Ok_Earth_1111,"Hey yall I passed my behind the wheel drivers license test today!!!! It was my third try!!! I am 24 years old and have put off driving for a long time because it gave me so much anxiety to think about being in control of a vehicle on the road. I have been practicing  (and crying ngl lol) for almost an entire year and honestly felt pretty hopeless after the first two tests. I was so anxious during the exams!! Literally hands shaking and at moments felt like I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù and that horrible sunken feeling in my stomach whenever I get anxious about anything. 
 

But i did it!!! If I can do it so can you!!! I see you, and I know you‚Äôre doing your best :) you will get it!

Good to know there are others like me. Once again, congrats!",63,GF8950,,0,,"Huge congratulations!! üéâ As someone who also dealt with driving anxiety, I totally get how massive this achievement is. The fact that you stuck with it through THREE attempts and a year of practice shows incredible persistence - you should be so proud of yourself!

That dissociative feeling and the shaky hands during the test are so real, but you pushed through it anyway. That's genuine courage right there. And the Olivia Rodrigo sync-up? That's just perfect cosmic timing!

For anyone else reading this who's in the same boat: it's totally okay to take your time learning to drive, whether you're 16 or 60. Driving anxiety is way more common than people think, and there's no shame in needing multiple attempts or extra practice. What matters is that you're working on it at your own pace.

You're absolutely right - if you can do it, others can too! Thanks for sharing your success story - it'll definitely help encourage others who are still working towards their license. üöó","

You know what helped me reframe it a bit? Realizing that anxiety is actually our brain trying to protect us - it's just really, really bad at knowing what's actually dangerous in our modern world. Like an overprotective friend who means well but needs to chill tf out.

Not sure if you're looking for advice or just needed to vent (which is totally valid), but if you want some practical stuff that's helped others:
- Deep breathing (I know, I know, but it actually works)
- Regular exercise
- Therapy if you can access it
- Cutting back on caffeine
- Progressive muscle relaxation

But sometimes you just need to say ""fuck anxiety"" and that's perfectly fine too. You're not alone in this fight. üí™","

qs7g8a,Anxiety,Ordered a coffee by myself for the first time in my life!,MsAtrixx,"The title says it all, I've never been into a Starbucks before and I'm 27 years old. The flashy drinks, bright lights and people all felt too overwhelming.

I had no idea how to order or what to order so I asked the nice girl at the counter for a recommendation and size, waited for my cup and even drank it inside surrounded by people without a single panic attack! 

I feel really proud of myself and I have no one to share it to. 
:)",1419,80,1636708560,"You got to share it with us, and it made me smile. Well done, friend :-) I hope the coffee was tasty.",160,BumblyRambler,"Good job, what kind of coffee was it?",10,[deleted],"That's a huge win - congratulations! As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how intimidating these ""simple"" everyday tasks can feel. Starbucks especially can be super overwhelming with their complex menu and busy atmosphere.

You did everything right - asking for recommendations when you're not sure what to get is super smart, and the baristas are usually happy to help. Plus, staying to enjoy your drink inside instead of rushing out is like a bonus achievement unlocked!

Don't minimize this accomplishment. Each small step like this builds confidence for future situations. Maybe next time you'll feel comfortable trying a different drink, or visiting during a busier time. Or maybe you'll just enjoy knowing you can pop in for a coffee whenever you want - that freedom feels amazing.

Really proud of you for pushing through the discomfort. Keep celebrating these victories, no matter how small they might seem to others. You've got this! üéâ","

It's like your brain has gotten so used to being anxious that when you're finally feeling peaceful, it almost feels... wrong? And then that thought itself triggers the anxiety to come rushing back. It's frustrating because you're basically anxious about not being anxious.

What helps me is reminding myself that it's actually a good sign - it means you're healing and your brain is just adjusting to this new, calmer state. It's like your mind is still running its usual anxiety ""security checks"" out of habit, even though you don't need them anymore.

Try acknowledging the thought when it comes (""I see you, anxiety"") but then gently remind yourself that it's okay to feel okay. You don't always have to be on high alert. Each time you practice letting yourself stay in that peaceful state, even when these thoughts pop up, you're basically retraining your brain to accept that being calm is safe and normal.

Be patient with yourself - you're unlearning patterns that probably took years to develop. It gets easier with time.","

n4ca68,Anxiety,"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!",Two-Tailed-Fox,"(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",1416,78,1620089958,"A note to those worried. The needles I've seen used are smaller than you are imagining, and far less painful than those needed for blood draws.",162,theotherkeith,"Proud of you, OP. I have the same phobia but I'm gonna get the covid vaxx no matter what. It's not just for my safety but the safety of vulnerable people around me. üíô I hope I'll have the same courage &amp; strength you had ü§û",4,AlpacaLoverX,"This is so awesome - as someone who also struggled with needle phobia for years, I totally get what a massive achievement this is! That moment of clarity you described is exactly what helped me too - finding that one focal point and almost disconnecting from the situation.

You should be incredibly proud of yourself. Not only did you face your fear, but you did it for such a selfless reason - protecting others during the pandemic. That takes real courage.

A tip for your second dose: tell the nurse upfront about your phobia and what worked for you this time (the focusing technique). Most healthcare workers are super understanding and will work with you to make it as comfortable as possible. Also, knowing you've done it once successfully can make the second time feel less daunting.

Keep celebrating these victories - they're huge steps forward in managing anxiety. You've proven to yourself that you're stronger than your fears, and that's something to hold onto! üí™","

Thank you for putting it to words, I may just borrow this explanation at my next therapy appointment (if it‚Äôs alright with you OP)",2,BassoonIsBest,"I totally get this - that nagging voice that makes you feel guilty for ""just"" enjoying something instead of being productive. I struggled with this exact thing for years.

Here's what helped me shift my perspective: Leisure and rest ARE productive. They're essential for your mental health, creativity, and overall wellbeing. Without proper downtime, you'll eventually burn out, making you less productive in the long run.

Try reframing your hobbies as investments in yourself rather than ""wasted time."" Watching a good movie can expand your perspective and spark creativity. Gaming can improve problem-solving skills. Reading for pleasure builds empathy and vocabulary.

As for not loving anything deeply - maybe that's okay? Being a renaissance person with varied interests is valuable too. But if it bothers you, consider setting a ""minimum commitment time"" for new interests (like 3 months) before allowing yourself to switch. This can help you push past the initial learning curve where deeper enjoyment often develops.

Remember: You don't have to earn the right to enjoy things. Taking time to simply exist and enjoy life is not just okay - it's necessary.","

What you're describing sounds less about being embarrassed by what you're doing and more about a lack of privacy and personal boundaries, which is completely valid given your living situation.

The fact that people enter your room without knocking is a real invasion of privacy. Have you considered having a direct conversation about establishing some basic boundaries, like requesting a knock before entry? Even if relations aren't great, that's a pretty reasonable ask.

In the meantime, some practical suggestions:
- Rearrange your desk/setup to face the door so you don't feel startled
- Use headphones for audio
- Consider a room divider or screen to create a more private area
- Practice gentle self-talk to remind yourself you're not doing anything wrong

Remember that wanting privacy is a normal, healthy need - you're not being unreasonable for wanting a space where you can exist without feeling watched. Hope some of these suggestions help!","

Close your eyes, breathe deep at a steady pace, and in your head keep saying 'just this breath' along with your breathing patterns. Focusing only on your breathing helps your brain slow down. It takes practice, and your mind will wander, bring it back to your breathing.

My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn‚Äôt work that way. This sucks ‚òπÔ∏è

geiyn7,Anxiety,Anyone else completely avoid tasks because they don't think they'll be good enough at it?,KatDT,"I have this a lot. I'll avoid cooking a new thing or doing a new task because I don't think I'll do a good enough job. I've noticed that a lot of my anxiety stems from a fear of disappointing other people, and I know that if I were to do a task for myself I could probably do it. But if the result affects others I completely tense up. It's like I suddenly forget to function at all if I'm given something I don't think I'll be good at. So I'll just avoid it entirely. Anyone else?",1386,103,1588767651,"Yes. But for me it goes beyond cooking, I won‚Äôt make positive life changes, like going for my MA, because I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to do it.",177,ky-98,[deleted],6,[deleted],"I totally relate to this. That fear of messing up and letting others down can be paralyzing - I've definitely found myself stuck in that cycle of avoidance too. It's like our brains convince us that not trying at all is somehow better than trying and being imperfect.

Something that's helped me is starting to reframe these situations as learning opportunities rather than pass/fail tests. Nobody starts out being good at things! Even ""naturals"" had to learn and make mistakes along the way. Plus, most people are way more understanding of imperfection than we imagine them to be in our heads.

Maybe try starting with really small, low-stakes versions of these tasks when they're just for you. Like trying a new recipe when you're the only one eating it, or practicing a new skill privately first. Build up that confidence gradually before taking on situations where others are involved.

Remember: doing something imperfectly is still way better than never doing it at all. Be gentle with yourself - you're learning and growing, and that's exactly what you're supposed to be doing.","

fwm9rl,Anxiety,My mother just told me that most people don‚Äôt over analyze and obsess over their mistakes made years ago? What is this witchcraft?,iamnotamangosteen,"So I showed her that meme of the girl lying in bed trying to sleep while her mind decides to suddenly replay her most embarrassing moments. And my mom said ‚Äúdoes that actually happen to you?‚Äù

And I just... does it not happen to most people? You mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? What? How?? 

That sounds so emotionally healthy! Meanwhile multiple times a week I lie awake at night replaying the moments I most wish hadn‚Äôt happened.

Edit: Did not know this would resonate with people... also apparently this is a symptom of my OCD!",1370,118,1586272674,"I wouldn't say it is unusual to do that every once and a while. Like once a month is probably pretty normal. If you spend almost every night doing this though, that is something to work on. It sounds like you struggle with embarrassment or fear of judgement. I used to be really bad about it, like if I said something that came across stupid or insensitive, I would apologize to that person, but I didn't forgive myself for it. I just replayed in my head how dumb it was. 

An old co-worker gave me the best advice about this. She said, no one is paying that much attention to you. It sounded mean at first but what she meant was, everyone else is so in their own head and worried about themselves that they probably will forget the dumb thing you said or did. 

It's like when you are nervous to give a speech in class. You are so afraid of messing up or everyone looking at you, but in reality, everyone else in the class is focused on being nervous themselves. 

Not sure if this is helpful, but maybe in time you won't be so critical of yourself.",222,Lgara92,Wow. I want to be like your mom.,35,Squirrelleee,"This is definitely more common than you think - you're not alone! I also lie awake sometimes cringing at things I said or did years ago. From what I understand, people who tend to overthink and replay past moments often have higher levels of empathy and self-awareness. While that's generally a good thing, it can definitely become overwhelming when left unchecked.

Something that's helped me is reminding myself that other people rarely remember our embarrassing moments - they're too busy thinking about their own! And even if they do remember, they likely don't care nearly as much as we think they do.

If these thoughts are significantly impacting your sleep and daily life (especially since you mentioned having OCD), it might be worth talking to a therapist. They can teach you specific techniques to manage intrusive thoughts and break that cycle of rumination.

But please know that having these thoughts doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. It's just that some of us have brains that like to put past moments on repeat. The goal isn't to never think about past mistakes - it's learning to acknowledge them without letting them take over.","

That constant sense of being ""too much"" or feeling like your mere existence is somehow wrong - I've been there, and so have many others. It's actually a common symptom of anxiety and low self-esteem.

What helped me was realizing that most people are too focused on their own lives to scrutinize us the way we scrutinize ourselves. That feeling that everyone hates you? It's usually our anxiety lying to us. Most people are neutral or even positive toward us, but our brains can twist things to seem much worse than reality.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help provide tools to challenge these thoughts and build self-acceptance. In the meantime, try to be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend feeling this way. You deserve to exist and take up space in this world, even if your brain tries to tell you otherwise.

Your edit shows such empathy for others feeling the same way - that's a beautiful quality to have. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

tension headaches. your neck doesn‚Äôt wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it‚Äôs in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

And one piece of advice that‚Äôs given is to have your tongue touch the roof of your mouth / the back of your upper front teeth. This is the best way to facilitate a relaxed jaw position and should be what one strives to become natural. 

So, I recommend against the advice to keep your tongue down or that having it at the roof of your mouth is a bad sign and causes tension.",1,lapinjapan,"This is such a helpful checklist! I've been dealing with anxiety for years and never realized how much physical tension I was holding until I started paying attention to these exact things. Just reading through your list made me notice I was doing at least 3 of these right now (especially that jaw/tongue tension - why do we do that??)

One thing I'd add is hand tension - I often catch myself making tight fists or gripping things way harder than necessary when stressed. Try opening and closing your hands slowly, then letting them rest naturally. It's amazing how these little body awareness checks can pull you out of that fight-or-flight state.

Thanks for sharing these practical tips. Sometimes we get so focused on the mental aspects of anxiety that we forget how much our physical state affects our stress levels. Going to save this post to reference when I'm feeling wound up! üôè","

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

Of course these two things run my mind in every direction. I fear any symptom I see online. I'm thirsty for a third bottle of water that day? Diabetes. It's bullshit and I'm done.

As someone who also deals with health anxiety, I know that spiral of constantly checking symptoms and convincing yourself something is terribly wrong. It's exhausting.

What really resonated with me was your point about rest and productivity. I've been feeling so guilty about not being as ""productive"" as I think I should be, but you're right - we're living through unprecedented times and it's okay to just...exist sometimes. To take that nap, to play that game, to simply breathe.

It's also really encouraging to hear about your journey from ER visits to feeling better. Sometimes when we're in the thick of anxiety, it feels like we'll never get out. But stories like yours remind us that these intense periods do pass.

Just remember that finding the right medication/dosage can take some time, so don't get discouraged if the first try isn't perfect. Keep open communication with your doctor about how you're feeling and any side effects. Also, consider combining the meds with therapy if you can - they often work really well together.

Remember that most people actually want to help and would rather you ask for clarification than make mistakes or feel lost. Plus, asking questions shows you're engaged and taking initiative to learn - those are positive qualities!

For the mumbling, try picking one small thing to practice at a time - maybe just speaking up clearly when ordering coffee, for example. Build confidence in low-pressure situations first.

And when these patterns and behaviors are noticed they are often excited by another behavior: us resisting them, or trying to hide them.

Ive found it incredibally effective to name these behaviors as if they were characters in your head, And when they appear, simply say hello to them. Maybe thank them for trying to keep you safe, and thats it. In time, they will relax, but this cant be your goal. Acceptance of them must be your goal.

Here are some of my characters:
""The reherses future conversations guy""

""The replays past social interactions guy""

""The finds reasons to avoid things guy""

""The narrator""

""The overanalyzing my owns words as i speak guy""

""The worried that future events wont happen the way I want them to guy""

""The trying to stop current behavior guy""

""The angry i was treated unfairly guy""

And i even visualize what they look like, sometimes draw them on paper. Give them a real voice and and real nod of ackowledgement, and you detach yourself from them. They eventually lose power over you.

I love how you've essentially turned parts work therapy into something really accessible and even kind of fun. Personifying these anxious thoughts helps create that crucial distance between ""you"" and ""your anxiety.""

I've actually started doing something similar, though less structured than your approach. I call my overthinking voice ""Professor"" because he's always trying to lecture me about everything that could go wrong. But I really like your idea of actually visualizing and drawing these characters - it makes them feel more concrete and manageable.

The part about thanking them for trying to keep you safe really resonates too. These ""characters"" often developed as protection mechanisms, even if they're not serving us well anymore. Acknowledging that with compassion instead of fighting against it is so much more effective than the usual ""stop overthinking!"" approach we tend to take with ourselves.

Thanks for sharing this technique - it's a really creative and practical tool for anyone dealing with anxiety.","

Is it possible that they made it look like the car wasn't starting suddenly because they wanted you to pay for a new battery?,7,mizurisana,"That's awesome - it's such a huge win when you can push through anxiety and advocate for yourself! You were completely in the right too - they should have told you about the battery issue when they first noticed it, and leaving you stranded with a non-starting car would have been unacceptable.

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how much courage it takes to speak up in situations like this. Each time you do it successfully, it builds your confidence for the next time. Try to remember this moment when you face similar situations in the future - you've proven to yourself that you can handle it!

And you did it in such a reasonable way too. You weren't rude or aggressive, you just firmly stated what needed to happen. That's exactly how self-advocacy should work.

Be proud of yourself - this is a bigger victory than non-anxiety folks might realize. You took care of yourself today! üí™","

hy5foz,Anxiety,Does anyone else get extremely distressed at minor criticism?,alittlehelpplease_,"Getting even slight negative feedback, particularly at work, makes me panic and feel distressed and anxious for the rest of the day. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everyone is thinking the same negative things about me. I know this is unhealthy, but I can't help it. Even kindly worded constructively criticism make me feel awful. Does anyone else feel like this? How can I stop it?",1366,100,1595763123,"Not only that, I get so anxious awaiting criticism. It sucks",244,acbrisba,"i have this issue, criticism seems to encase me in panic and negative thought loops. i‚Äôve been told that CBT helps with this, but if that‚Äôs inaccessible for you, it can be helpful to try to employ similar tactics in reshaping your thinking. so, say i‚Äôve written a story or something. i show it to someone and they tell me it‚Äôs good, but there are places where it can be worded better. that negative thought loop would tell me that i‚Äôm a horrible writer, i should never write again, the person who read my writing must think i suck, etc etc. well, what pulls me out of this is acknowledging the action for what it is. even though i may be a good writer, i can always get better and this person is trying to assist me in doing so by showing me where i can improve. it doesn‚Äôt mean that i‚Äôm not good enough, though, because everyone is always improving. so, while this person gave me criticism with good intent, that negative thought loop turned it into something malicious. 

i don‚Äôt know if this example made much sense, but i hope you kind of get the gist of what i‚Äôm saying. take criticism at face value and separate the action from the self. it doesn‚Äôt define you.",30,lifeofforsai,"I totally understand where you're coming from. I used to (and sometimes still do) get that exact same pit in my stomach from even mild criticism. That feeling of being ""not good enough"" is so overwhelming, and it can definitely spiral into assuming everyone else is judging you too.

Something that's helped me is trying to reframe criticism as a tool for growth rather than a judgment of my worth. I know that's easier said than done! But remember - getting feedback means someone believes in your ability to improve and wants to help you succeed. They're investing in you, not condemning you.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? What you're describing sounds a lot like rejection sensitive dysphoria or anxiety, and there are actually strategies that can help manage those intense emotional responses.

In the meantime, try writing down the feedback when you get it and coming back to it later when you're feeling calmer. It helps create some emotional distance and lets you look at it more objectively.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Be gentle with yourself as you work through it. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Those moments when every little noise feels like it's drilling into your brain and you just want to escape from everything - I've definitely been there.

Your instinct to seek out a dark, quiet space is actually really smart. That's your body telling you it needs a break from all the stimulation. Some things that help me during these times:

- Noise-canceling headphones (even without music)
- Soft earplugs
- Taking a warm shower in low light
- Wrapping up in a heavy blanket
- Deep breathing exercises

Don't feel bad about needing to step away and decompress. It's a totally valid response when your nervous system is overwhelmed. If this happens frequently, it might be worth mentioning to a doctor or therapist - they can help you develop more coping strategies.

When one concern gets resolved, it immediately latches onto something else, as if being anxious is its default setting. It's absolutely exhausting living in that cycle.

What helped me was learning about how anxiety works - our brains evolved to be really good at spotting potential threats, but sometimes that system goes into overdrive. It's not your fault; your brain is just being overprotective.

Have you tried mindfulness techniques? Not to stop the anxious thoughts (because fighting them often makes them stronger), but to practice observing them without getting caught up in them. Think of it like watching clouds pass by - you see them, but you don't have to chase after each one.

Also, therapy can be really helpful for breaking these cycles, particularly CBT. It gives you practical tools to work with these thought patterns.

What helped me was setting specific times to check reliable news sources (like once in the morning and maybe a quick evening update), then focusing on things I can actually control - following health guidelines, staying connected with loved ones virtually, and maintaining some kind of routine.

I've also started replacing some of that news-checking time with more positive activities - reading books, trying new recipes, or just taking walks outside when possible. It's amazing how much clearer your head feels when you're not constantly bombarded with headlines.

Your mental health matters just as much as physical health during these times. Stay informed, but don't let it consume you. Thanks for the reminder - we all need to hear this sometimes!","

igkk32,Anxiety,I‚Äôm so worried about wasting my time that I wind up wasting my time,TehJezzy,"It sucks. I‚Äôm sure all of us have these days where we have a whole list of goals we want to accomplish but our time anxiety gets the best of us. 

I‚Äôve tried doing the small goals approach, but I wind up feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. My lack of self motivation is so atrocious it‚Äôs a miracle I can wake up at normal times.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues? It sucks because I want to continue with my future but my complacency from anxiety and depression just wraps itself around me.",1403,48,1598387880,"So I""m still working on this, and I don't have a solid solution yet, but I can try to share what's worked for me. 

It all comes down to harm reduction and countering shame. I've been working (with the help of my therapist) on positive self-talk and not falling into the trap of shaming myself for ""wasting time"" because shame is not a motivator. It just makes me feel worse and I go online to avoid the negative feelings and the spiral intensifies. 

I've instead been focusing on harm reduction. I can't just stop ""wasting time"" all at once, but I can get better at focusing on the task at hand. I can try to push myself a little bit more each time and then acknowledge that. So instead of the negative self-talk of ""oh no you wasted 30 minutes"" it could be ""you spent only 30 minutes on Reddit this time as opposed to 45 and then you got focused again. How can we make that time to focus shorter?"" I'm been working on using timers for work and for breaks and trying not to be angry at myself when I forget to set them or follow them. 

It all boils down to self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself. And remember one more important detail: internalized capitalism is the worst. You have value irrespective of what you accomplish. You are not worthless because you haven't produced what you want or feel like you need to produce. You are not a robot and you are going to have days when you feel really productive and days when you need to just curl up into a ball and wait for the day to go by. What's important is to be able to tell the difference between the two.",124,Emperor_Pengwing,,0,,"I totally get this - it's like being caught in this frustrating loop where worrying about wasting time actually becomes the thing that wastes your time. I've been there, and it's exhausting.

Something that helped me was reframing what ""productivity"" means. Instead of beating myself up for not doing enough, I started celebrating small wins. Even getting out of bed at a normal time (which you're already doing!) is a legitimate accomplishment when dealing with anxiety and depression.

Try this: Pick ONE thing - just one - that you want to do tomorrow. Not five things, not a whole list. Make it something small and specific. When you complete it, really let yourself feel good about it. No ""but I should have done more"" thoughts allowed.

Remember that healing from anxiety and depression isn't a waste of time - it's necessary maintenance. You wouldn't call charging your phone a waste of time, right? Sometimes just existing and taking care of yourself is enough.

You're not being complacent - you're here asking for help and looking for solutions. That's already a step forward.","

Edit 2: it‚Äôs most likely a form of intrusive thoughts. We all have stupid crazy thoughts, that‚Äôs ok and very normal. What may indicate a problem is when the existence of this thought begins to persist, bother you, affect your mood, your life or relationship with people.

This is super common and I experience it too. Those random memories of awkward moments or embarrassing situations just pop into your head uninvited, and your body physically reacts - I totally get the speaking out loud part, I sometimes make random noises or shake my head to ""clear"" the thought.

It's actually a pretty normal human experience, though it can feel isolating when it happens. Our brains seem to love replaying these cringe-worthy moments, especially when we're trying to focus on something else. While it's typically harmless, if you find these thoughts are seriously disrupting your daily life or causing significant distress, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional.

Some people find it helpful to remind themselves that everyone has these moments, and that the awkward situation probably wasn't as bad as we remember it. Plus, most people are too focused on their own embarrassing memories to remember ours!

like noticeably cringe to the degree that if I was reading something, I would read it louder. Or I would say random things out load because of all the awkward energy. 

Please tell me that I‚Äôm not alone

TLD;R I get physical reactions to thoughts

Edit: We got a nameee for ittt!!! It is called ‚Äúcringe attacks‚Äù and you can find it on google! thanks u/Thy_Introvert

Edit 2: it‚Äôs most likely a form of intrusive thoughts. We all have stupid crazy thoughts, that‚Äôs ok and very normal. What may indicate a problem is when the existence of this thought begins to persist, bother you, affect your mood, your life or relationship with people. Having the though is no problem but your *reaction* to the though might indicate something bigger like OCD. Please stay safe and consult a professional if you think it indicates a deeper issue‚ù§Ô∏è

There's something magical about just letting yourself completely lose inhibition and dance like nobody's watching (because literally nobody is). The 50s had such amazing feel-good music too - that blend of rock & roll, doo-wop, and swing just hits different.

Don't be embarrassed at all - these small moments of pure joy are what make life beautiful. Sometimes our happiest memories aren't the big planned events, but rather those spontaneous instances where we just let ourselves be totally present and free.

Keep having these dance sessions! Make it a morning ritual if you can. Dancing releases endorphins, reduces stress, and is genuinely good for both mental and physical health. Plus, being a ""basement dwelling rat"" who finds joy in simple pleasures is way better than being someone who's too cool to dance alone.

Also, your high self just gave your sober self a wonderful gift - the reminder that happiness doesn't have to be complicated. Sometimes it's just you, some Elvis tunes, and some questionable dance moves in the dark. üï∫","

kpu9sp,Anxiety,I don't want to go back to work tomorrow... sunday blues after time off work.,OrigamiToad,"I always get Sunday blues and anxious about mondays... but after having a few weeks off work for christmas, I feel so sick about going back to work tomorrow... even though I'm still ""working from home"". It has ruined my mood the whole weekend, I feel so nervous and down and on edge. 

I just want to call in sick forever and hide in bed...

üòì 

I hate lying in bed at night wide awake worrying about the morning... I hate the feeling of worrying about not sleeping and it making the situation worse. 

Has anyone found a way to combat sinday blues / work anxiety after time off? 

Sending love to everyone else facing Monday...

*Edit: thank you everyone for your kind messages and replies. I love the phrase ""Sunday Scaries"", I'll be using that! 

I survived the night (barely)... horrible nights sleep. 

I think I will start trying meditation. Even though I am on medication that helps my anxiety,I have so much trouble switching my brain off at night. 

We can do it! üíô",1319,129,1609711723,"I make it a point to do something--anything at all--so I don't end Sunday feeling like all I did was fret. I mean, I do still fret, but at least I also did other stuff. Today I ran errands and went for a nice walk at the park.

I currently have the best job I've had in years so I should be thankful. But I'm still dreading tomorrow and my stomach hurts.",154,anxiousjeff,,0,,"I totally get those ""Sunday Scaries"" - they hit especially hard after a longer break when you've gotten used to that freedom. The anticipation is often worse than the actual return, but that doesn't make the anxiety any less real.

Something that's helped me is creating a Sunday evening routine that I actually look forward to. I make my favorite tea, do some light meal prep for the week (nothing intense, just basics), and spend 15 minutes organizing my Monday tasks so I feel more in control. Having something pleasant to focus on helps break that spiral of worrying about not sleeping.

Also, try to be gentle with yourself tomorrow. That first day back is always an adjustment, and it's okay to ease in gradually. Maybe start with the easier tasks to build momentum?

Remember - this feeling is temporary, and you've gotten through every other ""first day back"" before this one. You've got this! üí™

P.S. The meditation you mentioned in your edit is a great idea. Even 5 minutes of simple breathing exercises before bed can make a difference.","

l0v05b,Anxiety,I wish people would understand that anxiety isn‚Äôt always full blown panic attacks,curlyheadedfuck99,"It‚Äôs not just getting really breathless and panicky for a short period of time, or being scared to go into social situations. It‚Äôs feeling breathless for days, it‚Äôs headaches, dizziness, poor memory, no appetite, it‚Äôs all these physical symptoms that just add to this feeling hovering over you that there‚Äôs something wrong all the time like a cloud. i‚Äôm sorry for ranting but i just needed to get this out",1361,86,1611095341,"And panic attacks aren't always so obvious like hyperventilating and rocking back and forth. Sometimes they're feeling ill and being frozen and unable to speak while your mind is racing with things you know aren't true but also can't stop thinking. Sometimes I will literally freeze in social situations where I want to speak but it feels like there's an actual wall stopping me from speaking.

It's so awkward trying to explain anxiety to people who don't have it. This post is so relatable and I'm sorry you have to deal with any of these anxiety symptoms.",260,Souffle_Girl0,,0,,"You're absolutely right, and I really appreciate you putting this into words. Anxiety is like this constant background program running in your brain that affects literally everything - from how your body feels to how you process basic daily tasks. That persistent feeling of ""something's wrong"" even when you can't pin down what it is... that's so draining to deal with day after day.

Have you heard of the ""anxiety lake"" analogy? Sometimes anxiety isn't the dramatic splash of a panic attack, it's more like treading water constantly - exhausting and affects your whole system over time. The physical symptoms you described are so real and valid.

Please know you're not alone in experiencing this. If you haven't already, it might be worth talking to a doctor about these ongoing physical symptoms. They can help determine if there are ways to better manage both the mental and physical aspects of what you're going through.

Your ""rant"" isn't just venting - it's helping others understand what chronic anxiety actually looks like. Thank you for sharing this perspective.","

gmezo7,Anxiety,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?",[deleted],"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It‚Äôs so wonderfully comforting to know that I‚Äôm not the only one going through this.",1328,117,1589851993,"Sounds more like an anxiety attack (which is different than a panic attack). When I'm having a panic attack, I can't really function well and you can tell I'm panicing, but when I'm having an anxiety attack, I can seem like I'm still functioning while I'm freaking out on the inside.",269,billyandteddy,"Sounds more like an anxiety attack (which is different than a panic attack). When I'm having a panic attack, I can't really function well and you can tell I'm panicing, but when I'm having an anxiety attack, I can seem like I'm still functioning while I'm freaking out on the inside.",269,billyandteddy,"I absolutely understand what you're going through, and you're definitely not alone. What you're describing sounds exactly like high-functioning anxiety with panic attacks - where you've essentially trained yourself to mask the symptoms while still experiencing all the internal turmoil. It's actually quite common, especially among people who are worried about letting others down or appearing ""weak.""

Please know that your experiences are completely valid. Any medical professional who dismisses your symptoms because they don't fit a textbook definition isn't giving you proper care. Panic attacks can present differently in different people, and being able to ""function"" through them doesn't make them any less real or severe.

Consider finding a new therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders and actually listens to your experiences. You deserve support from someone who understands that anxiety isn't one-size-fits-all. In the meantime, remember that it's okay to tell trusted people when you're struggling - you don't have to carry this burden alone just because your panic attacks aren't visible to others.

Stay strong, and don't let anyone invalidate your experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

jcwbws,Anxiety,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,State-City,"I‚Äôm a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

What you've accomplished is huge - going from not being able to leave your car to taking walks and developing a whole wellness routine is amazing progress. I love how you approached it gradually by first just driving there to get comfortable. That's such a smart way to work through anxiety.

The journaling routine you've developed sounds really powerful too. Writing down things you love about yourself and setting achievable goals are fantastic tools for maintaining mental health and building confidence.

As someone who has dealt with anxiety myself, I know how overwhelming seemingly ""simple"" tasks can feel. Every victory, no matter how small it might seem to others, is worth celebrating. You're not just walking in a park - you're reclaiming your independence and quality of life.

Keep taking those baby steps. You've already proven to yourself that you're stronger than you thought. Thank you for sharing your story - it will definitely help others who are struggling with similar challenges.","

While we can't completely eliminate anxiety (and some amount is actually healthy/normal), there are ways to make it more manageable. Have you tried working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety? CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and mindfulness techniques have helped me tremendously. Even simple things like regular exercise, cutting back on caffeine, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule can make a significant difference.

Remember that you're not broken or weak for feeling this way. Anxiety is a real medical condition that affects millions of people. It may not go away completely, but with the right tools and support, it can get better. Don't give up on finding what works for you.

Anxiety is such an exhausting, frustrating burden to carry around. That constant feeling of dread and worry draining your energy, making simple things feel impossible sometimes - it's absolute bullshit.

Here's the thing though - while anxiety feels like our enemy, it's actually our brain's (overactive) protection system. Understanding that helped me shift from fighting it to working with it. Doesn't make it suck less, but gives us something to work with.

Have you looked into therapy or counseling? Having someone help you develop coping strategies can be a game-changer. Even simple stuff like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness can help take the edge off when anxiety's being particularly nasty.

You're not alone in this fight. Millions of us are dealing with this invisible battle every day. It's okay to be angry at it, to hate it, to need to vent. Just remember - anxiety is part of you, but it isn't ALL of you. You're stronger than you think, even on the days when it doesn't feel like it.","

j8tkja,Anxiety,Stop telling me everyone has anxiety!,hr0519,"I understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. But it‚Äôs still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear. I‚Äôm not sure everyone spends over half an hour picking out an outfit, can‚Äôt get on the bus by themselves because they‚Äôre irrationally afraid of pulling the stop cord wrong, or overthink everything, down to how long they should toast their bread for.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say ‚Äúoh well everyone has anxiety‚Äù. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say ‚Äúthank you for telling me.‚Äù 

Sorry for the rambling to whoever actually read this.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for responding to my little rant. I‚Äôve been cooped up in my apartment because of COVID feeling very much alone. I‚Äôm glad to know I am not alone in how I feel :-)

EDIT2: wow, I was shocked when just a few people replied. thank you everyone for commenting. i do want to say I feel no malice towards those who comment those things about anxiety, but I also think it goes to show how important mental health education is. I know when people say these things they come from a good place :)",1326,112,1602368332,Exactly! There's a difference between feeling anxious and having an anxiety disorder. Everyone gets anxious. It doesn't affect everyone's day to day life.,417,cheesiestcake17,Exactly! There's a difference between feeling anxious and having an anxiety disorder. Everyone gets anxious. It doesn't affect everyone's day to day life.,417,cheesiestcake17,"You're absolutely right - there's a huge difference between normal situational anxiety and having an anxiety disorder that impacts your daily functioning. When people try to normalize it by saying ""everyone has anxiety,"" they're probably trying to make you feel less alone, but it ends up minimizing your very real struggles.

What you're describing - the overthinking, the fear of everyday tasks, spending so much mental energy on decisions - that's not just ""regular anxiety."" That's your brain working overtime in ways that actively disrupt your life.

Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this. It takes courage to open up about mental health challenges. And you're right - sometimes we don't need people to solve or normalize our problems, we just need them to listen and acknowledge what we're going through.

I hope you know there are many of us who truly understand what you're experiencing. Your feelings are valid, your struggles are real, and you deserve support and understanding - not dismissive comparisons to everyday stress.","

Its eating me away sometimes.,231,TheReturnOfDisturbed,Yeah and the older you get the more awkward moments you accumulate and obsess over,37,Funkiebunch,"I totally get this - that awful feeling where your brain gets stuck on replay mode, analyzing every little detail of what happened. It's such a universal human experience! I'm glad you posted the update that everything turned out okay, but I still understand why it affected you so strongly in the moment.

You know what helps me? Reminding myself that most people are way too focused on their own lives/mistakes to remember our awkward moments. And even when they do notice, they usually forget pretty quickly. We tend to be our own harshest critics.

Try to be gentle with yourself - anxiety can make small things feel huge in the moment. Maybe next time those intrusive thoughts start spinning, take a deep breath and ask yourself ""Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?"" Usually the answer is no.

Glad things worked out in the end! Don't beat yourself up about having such a strong reaction - it just means you're human like the rest of us. üíú","

The constant barrage of intense news and political turmoil can feel completely overwhelming, especially when it seems like things are spiraling. Your anxiety response is totally valid and you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.

A few things that help me when it all feels like too much:
- Take breaks from news/social media. Set specific times to check updates rather than doomscrolling
- Focus on what's in your immediate control - your local community, helping neighbors, voting in local elections
- Ground yourself with basic self-care: get outside, move your body, connect with friends/family
- Remember that feeling anxious about serious situations is actually a sign of being an engaged, caring person

It's okay to step back and protect your mental health. The world will still be there when you're feeling more centered. Maybe check out r/anxiety or r/MentalHealth for more specific coping strategies if you need them.

I love your idea about passing the positivity forward. Actually, I've noticed that on my better days, sending even a simple ""thinking of you"" text to a friend not only brightens their day but helps maintain my own positive mindset. It's like creating this beautiful ripple effect of good vibes.

Taking that first step to see a psychologist is huge and takes real courage. I'm proud of you for making this decision to prioritize your mental health.

Just remember - finding the right therapist can sometimes take a couple tries, and that's totally normal. If the first one doesn't feel like a good fit, it's completely okay to try someone else. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable opening up to them.

Also, don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate changes. Therapy is often a journey, and like any journey, it takes time. But you've already done the hardest part - deciding to go and taking action.

DAE feel this?",1259,174,1616985187,"Yeah all the time, it's one of the topics I ruminate on most often and has probably made my depression worse.

I'm also in my 30s, and I often catch myself playing the ""what if"" game about all the paths I didn't take because anxiety held me back. It's like having a constant backseat driver who only knows how to say ""that's too risky"" or ""you'll probably fail.""

But here's something I've learned through therapy: Those thoughts about ""wasted"" time aren't helping us. The person you are today - even with anxiety - has developed incredible strengths. Think about it: you've been playing life on hard mode, yet here you are, still pushing forward and being introspective about your growth.

Instead of focusing on who you ""could have been,"" maybe we can reframe this as who you can still become. You're not too late. Many people hit their stride in their 30s, 40s, or beyond. Your anxiety might be part of your story, but it doesn't have to be the whole story.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about these feelings? It's been game-changing for many of us in similar situations.","

The combination of health concerns, financial stress, and general uncertainty is enough to make anyone feel completely paralyzed. You're not alone in feeling this way.

Let's break this down into smaller pieces. For immediate help with pre-diabetes, check out r/diabetes for free advice and support. Many communities also have sliding-scale health clinics that can help regardless of your ability to pay - I can help you find one if you share your general location.

For the immediate mental health crisis, please call 988 (the suicide prevention lifeline) if you're having thoughts of self-harm. They can connect you with free resources in your area.

Small steps are key right now. Try to establish just ONE routine - maybe going to bed at the same time each night. That alone can help create a bit of structure and control.

You don't have to figure everything out at once. Focus on today, reach out for help (like you're doing now), and remember that this situation won't last forever, even though it feels endless right now.

What kind of support would be most helpful to you right now?","

azrmao,Anxiety,I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,ThomasDHL,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

Edit 2: Wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. I've read all of them and I am speechless. Also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, I appreciate it very much. I don't really know what to say, this community is so kind. Thank you ",1195,232,1552298508,Why would they put you by yourself on your first day? Sounds like an awful manager. ,1560,SmittyManJensen_,,0,,"That manager was completely unreasonable - firing someone on their first day for normal training issues is ridiculous and says more about their poor management than your abilities. Every cashier starts somewhere, and it's totally normal to be slow and make mistakes while learning the system. Your anxiety doesn't make you incapable of working - you just need a more supportive environment with proper training.

Please don't let this destroy your confidence. This was a management failure, not a you failure. A good workplace would have:
- Given you proper register training
- Had someone shadowing you on day one
- Helped manage customer flow to your line
- Supported you with difficult customers

The fact that you already have another interview lined up shows great resilience! For your next job, it's perfectly okay to ask about their training process during the interview. And if you're comfortable, you can mention that you work best with clear instructions and a bit of patience while learning new systems.

hm9kez,Anxiety,When being asleep is the only time you feel good,AJ_LA1313,That moment when you wake up and your heart immediately starts thumping because you realize that you're going to have to deal with stress again today. Ugh.,1324,101,1594048829,"I lucid dream, so sometimes I get a little bit addicted to having absolute control and sleep more than I should...",116,[deleted],I agree but.. What if you can barely sleep cause of anxiety? Fun fun fun,75,lostallhope4,"I know exactly what you mean about that sinking feeling when you first wake up. That immediate rush of anxiety before you've even gotten out of bed is brutal - like your body goes from peaceful sleep straight into fight-or-flight mode.

Have you tried taking just 5 minutes when you first wake up to do some deep breathing before engaging with the day? I found it helps to create a tiny buffer zone between sleep and stress. Sometimes I'll even set my alarm 10 minutes early just to have that peaceful transition time.

Also, it might be worth looking at what specific things are causing that morning dread. Sometimes when we're overwhelmed, everything feels like one big ball of stress, but breaking it down into smaller pieces can make it feel more manageable.

You're not alone in this feeling - many of us have been there. If this has been going on for a while, please consider talking to someone professional about it. There's no shame in getting help to make your waking hours feel more livable. Sending support your way.","

It can be something so small and I can‚Äôt focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just making yourself over think, you‚Äôre doing this to your self just stop overthinking‚Äù which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running.

I hope someone offers some advice!,54,prttyguardian,"I totally relate to the ""multiple browser tabs"" analogy - that's such a perfect way to describe anxiety-driven overthinking. What you're experiencing sounds really overwhelming and exhausting, and it's completely understandable that you're tired of dealing with it.

People who say ""just stop overthinking"" don't get it - if it were that simple, we'd all do it! This sounds like classic anxiety, and it's not something you're choosing or doing to yourself.

A few things that have helped me:
- Mindfulness meditation (start small, even 5 mins)
- Writing thoughts down to get them ""out of your head""
- Talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety (they can teach you specific techniques)
- Regular exercise to burn off that anxious energy

Most importantly, please know you're not alone in this. Anxiety can be managed with the right tools and support. It might be worth talking to your doctor specifically about anxiety treatment options. You don't have to just live with your mind being this loud all the time.","

I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it‚Äôs in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won‚Äôt let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can‚Äôt focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just making yourself over think, you‚Äôre doing this to your self just stop overthinking‚Äù which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It‚Äôs all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it‚Äôs not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I‚Äôm starting to see maybe it‚Äôs anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I‚Äôm so tired of it effecting my everyday life. If you have any tips for making your mind not be so loud and controlling please leave comment I am so tired of letting myself bring myself down every single day.

dm63gs,Anxiety,Anyone else get random cringe flashbacks?,[deleted],"I keep getting overwhelmed with thoughts of embarrassing things I did like 5 years ago. It comes with a wave of anxiety and the strong urge to crawl under a table or punch myself for doing something so stupid, and it's like I'm reliving all the cringe.",1272,150,1571866113,"yep, constantly. the annoying thing is I'll often audibly cringe or call myself stupid or something out of nowhere. I probably look like I'm on drugs to innocent bystanders",227,antagonistalex,"yeah I f\*cking hate that, always get that in the shower. I start screaming &amp; cursing :) .",62,M313M313,"Oh man, I know EXACTLY what you're talking about. Those random moments when your brain decides ""hey, remember that awkward thing you did in 2018?"" and suddenly you're physically cringing. It happens to me too, especially when I'm trying to fall asleep!

Here's what helps me: First, remember that everyone (seriously, EVERYONE) has these moments. The people who witnessed your ""cringe"" moment probably don't even remember it - they're too busy thinking about their own embarrassing memories.

When these thoughts hit, try to reframe them. They're actually a sign of growth - you're cringing because you've matured and would handle things differently now. That's a good thing! 

Something that really helps is saying ""that's enough"" out loud when these thoughts pop up, then deliberately focusing on something else. Or try laughing about it - we're all just humans doing our best and sometimes failing spectacularly.

You're definitely not alone in this. It's such a universal human experience that it's basically a meme at this point!","

It's so easy to get caught up in our daily struggles and forget that we're all just doing our best to figure things out. 

I've found that on my hardest days, looking back at previous ""impossible"" situations that I somehow made it through helps put things in perspective. We're often stronger and more resilient than we give ourselves credit for.

And you're absolutely right about everyone having something unique to give. Sometimes we get so focused on comparing ourselves to others that we forget our own journey and gifts are valuable too, even if they look different from everyone else's.

To anyone reading this who's struggling right now: take a deep breath. You've made it through every bad day so far - that's a pretty impressive track record. Be gentle with yourself. Tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities.

Definitely deserving of those tattoos :),53,CaptainSlightlySpicy,"This is such a huge accomplishment - congratulations on one full year! You absolutely should be proud of yourself. Breaking free from self-harm takes incredible strength and determination, and you've proven you have both.

I love that you set the tattoo coverage as a reward for staying clean. It's a beautiful way to reclaim your body and transform those marks into something meaningful to you. While you're saving up, maybe consider sketching out some design ideas or making a mood board? That planning process can be really therapeutic and give you something positive to focus on.

Keep celebrating these victories, both big and small. Every day clean is an achievement, and you've strung together 365 of them. That's incredible. If you ever have tough days ahead (which is totally normal), remember how far you've come and how strong you've proven yourself to be.

Sending you so much support and pride. You've got this! üí™","

I've been there - that pit in your stomach when your boss wants to chat, constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop despite good performance reviews.

Here's the thing: the fact that you worry about doing a good job usually means you're actually doing better than you think. People who are truly bad at their jobs rarely have this level of self-awareness or concern about their performance.

Try keeping a ""wins folder"" - save emails with positive feedback, jot down compliments and achievements. On those anxiety-heavy days, it helps to have concrete evidence that you're valued and doing well.

Also, remember that everyone makes mistakes. Companies invest time and resources in training employees - they're not looking to fire people over minor slip-ups. They hired you because they saw potential in you, and you're proving them right every day you show up and do your best.

You belong there. The anxiety is lying to you.","

That feeling of wanting to keep your eyes closed because reality feels too overwhelming - I think many of us have been there, even if we don't talk about it often.

Have you considered starting really small with your mornings? Instead of thinking about the whole day ahead (which can feel massive), maybe just focus on one tiny pleasant thing when you first wake up. It could be feeling your favorite blanket, taking a few deep breaths, or even just stretching in bed. Something that feels doable and maybe even a little nice.

The fact that you're aware of these feelings and reaching out is actually a really important step. If this has been going on for a while though, it might be worth talking to a therapist - this kind of persistent anxiety around daily life is something they can help you work through.

Working long shifts while being underpaid AND having to put on a fake social face the whole time is absolutely draining. The Sunday scaries hit different when you're burned out like this.

Have you started looking for other jobs? The best time to job hunt is while you still have one, even though it's exhausting. Companies are desperate for workers right now, so you might be able to find something with better hours and pay. In the meantime, any chance you could talk to your manager about adjusting your schedule? 50 hours in 5 days is rough.

Also, check if you qualify for any assistance programs for food security - no one should have to choose between working themselves to death and eating. r/EatCheap might have some helpful resources too.

Hang in there. This situation sounds truly awful, but it doesn't have to be permanent. Take care of yourself first - your job clearly isn't going to do it for you. Sending you a virtual hug (or fist bump if that's more your style).","

nq57g9,Anxiety,In elementary school when we would read outloud from the textbook I would literally count the kids in front of me and figure out what section I was reading so I could practice it before it got my turn so I wouldn't mess up..,yeshereitis,And I think that's where my anxiety started.,1297,114,1622583118,thought that was a normal thing,263,Silver_Mooon,I did the same thing lol,43,sammyg723,"I did the exact same thing! It's amazing how many of us share this common experience of silently counting heads and frantically pre-reading our paragraphs. That pressure to not mess up in front of the whole class was so intense, especially at that age.

Looking back now, I realize this was probably a sign of early anxiety for me too. It's interesting how these seemingly small classroom moments can have such a lasting impact on us. The thing is, I bet most of your classmates were so focused on their own sections that they barely noticed if anyone stumbled over words.

If you're still dealing with similar anxiety today, please know you're not alone. Many of us who had these experiences have learned to manage those feelings better as adults. Sometimes just recognizing where these patterns started can help us understand and work through them.

Have you ever talked to others about this? It's pretty therapeutic to discover how many people relate to this exact scenario!","

Phone anxiety is incredibly real and common - I deal with it too and know exactly what you mean about the shaking and having to rehearse everything beforehand. 

The fact that you pushed through and made that call anyway is seriously impressive. That's exactly how you build confidence - by facing these challenges one step at a time. Starting with doctor's calls is smart too, since they're important but usually pretty structured conversations.

A tip that helps me: I keep a little notepad by my phone where I jot down key points I need to mention. It helps prevent that mind-blank moment when you're nervous. Also, remember that the person on the other end makes/receives dozens of calls every day and probably won't remember yours 10 minutes later.

Keep celebrating these victories! Each call gets a tiny bit easier, and you're already proving to yourself that you can do it. Really proud of you for taking this step! üéâ","

That cycle of craving alone time, then feeling guilty for ""wasting"" it, then spiraling into anxiety is something I'm very familiar with. You're definitely not alone in this.

Something that's helped me is reframing what ""productive relaxation"" means. Instead of seeing a day off as this huge blank canvas that I need to fill perfectly, I try to set just 1-2 small, achievable goals (like reading one chapter or taking a nice shower) and consider anything beyond that a bonus. This takes some of the pressure off.

Also, remember that true rest IS productive. Your brain and body need downtime to function well. Those ""lazy"" days are actually helping you recharge, even if anxiety tries to tell you otherwise.

Maybe try starting your alone time with a short meditation or some gentle movement to ground yourself before the anxious thoughts kick in. And be kind to yourself - you're not failing by struggling with this. It's a really common challenge for those of us with anxiety.","

The shift from paycheck-to-paycheck to salary can be a big adjustment.

I'm taking online classes for a ""safer"" career, living with my mom. I let my fear freeze me. It happens on a momentary scale like when I can't react and get in a car wreck. But I realized it's on a large, life scale. I'm too scared to move away. Too scared when I try to go on a date with a girl. Too scared of reality so I dissociate and run away with TV or games (used to be drugs and liquor). I'm just too afraid of everything. On lots of meds, but they don't help like they did at first. It doesn't get better, the future only gets worse as old people die and leave, and no new people come in. I know that's distorted thinking, but, I don't know.

Do you have a plan? ",30,zimgotreal,"I totally understand this fear - it's like being trapped between the comfort of what's familiar and the gnawing feeling that you're missing out on what life could be. Anxiety can be like an overprotective friend who means well but holds you back.

Something that helped me was reframing how I approach stepping outside my comfort zone. Instead of making huge leaps, try taking ""micro-risks"" - small steps that feel manageable but still push your boundaries a bit. Maybe it's talking to one new person, trying a new route to work, or signing up for that class you've been eyeing.

The key is to celebrate these small wins. Each time you do something that makes your anxiety uncomfortable but you do it anyway, you're proving to yourself that you're capable of more than your anxiety suggests.

Remember that growth doesn't have to mean dramatic life changes. It's okay to move at your own pace. The fact that you're aware of this and actively trying to tackle it shows you're already taking steps to prevent that future regret you're worried about.

You've got this, and it's never too late to start expanding your world, one small step at a time.","

kwxnjs,Anxiety,I wish there was a 'close all tabs' button for racing thoughts.,SecretlyFallingApart,"I got jealous, of my own phone being able to close all open tabs with just one button.... Yep it's one of those nights....",1353,56,1610596206,"This is basically what antipsychotics e.g. quetiapine are like. Can't have racing thoughts if you can't have *any* thoughts \*taps head\*.

But, personally, I find mindfulness can sort of achieve this with sufficient practice. It's less a ""Close All Tabs"" and more a ""Task Manager"", where you open up to the thoughts chasing you, recognise them simply as just thoughts, and let them pass on through as you ever-eternally return your focus to the present senses/breath/whatever.",99,TheLastHayley,,0,,"I feel this so hard. Those nights when your brain has like 47 tabs open, all playing their own anxiety music at full volume, and there's no simple ""close all"" solution. 

Have you ever tried the ""brain dump"" technique? When my thoughts are racing, I grab a notebook and just write everything down - all the random thoughts, worries, whatever's bouncing around up there. It's like manually closing those mental tabs one by one. Doesn't always solve everything, but it helps get some of that mental clutter onto paper where it feels more manageable.

Another thing that helps me is picturing those thoughts as actual browser tabs and saying ""okay, I see you, but I'm putting you in bookmark folder called 'deal with later.'"" Sometimes just acknowledging the thoughts but giving yourself permission to set them aside for now can help quiet things down.

Sending you good vibes. Racing thoughts are exhausting, and I hope you find your mental ""close all"" button soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

The fear of judgment and downvotes is really common, and I've definitely had those same moments of typing out whole comments only to delete them. It's like having stage fright, but for the internet.

Here's something that helped me: Remember that some of the most interesting discussions come from people sharing different perspectives. Even if some people disagree, others might really appreciate hearing your point of view. Plus, karma isn't actually that important in the grand scheme of things.

Maybe try starting small? Comment on lighter topics first, like hobby subreddits where people tend to be more supportive. Or pick communities that specifically welcome beginners and different opinions.

And honestly, some of my most valuable Reddit interactions came from times when I pushed through that fear and hit ""post"" anyway. Even if you get a few downvotes, it's not the end of the world. Your voice matters, and contributing to discussions gets easier with practice.

Don't let anyone minimize this victory - taking the first step into the workforce when you've been dealing with anxiety about it is one of the hardest things to do. Each day will get a little easier as you build confidence and routine.

Quick tip: In these first few weeks, keep a small notebook to write down things you learn and questions that come up. It helps manage the overwhelm and shows initiative to your new employer.

You should be really proud of yourself. This isn't just about getting a job - it's about proving to yourself that you can do things you thought were impossible. Keep that feeling in your pocket for the next time you face something scary.

Wishing you all the best in your new role! üí™","

What you're describing is really common with anxiety. Even when our logical brain is like ""everything is fine,"" our body can still be stuck in that fight-or-flight response.

Something that helped me understand this better was learning that physical anxiety symptoms are basically our body's ancient survival system kicking in. It's trying to protect us, even when we don't need protecting. The good news is that while you can't just ""turn off"" these physical reactions, you can work with them.

Deep breathing exercises (especially diaphragmatic breathing) and progressive muscle relaxation have helped me a lot with the physical symptoms. Also, just acknowledging ""okay, this is my body doing its thing"" instead of fighting against the sensations can make them less intense over time.

Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you specific techniques to help bridge that gap between your rational thoughts and physical responses.

Hang in there - you're already doing great by being able to think rationally through the anxiety! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

The fact that you're willing to take time out of your day to check on complete strangers shows incredible compassion.

Don't feel anxious about reaching everyone - the fact that you're making the effort at all is what matters. Maybe you could also encourage those who receive messages to ""pay it forward"" and check on someone else when they're able. That way, you're not just creating individual connections, but potentially starting a chain reaction of caring.

I'd be happy to help share the load - we could create a little community of people looking out for each other. Sometimes the smallest gestures can make the biggest difference in someone's day.

I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

I thought my anxiety were just the attacks I had or when it was really bad that I couldn't leave the house, I did not realize I had it every single day. I must have just got so used to having anxiety all my life that it seemed normal to me.

It's like finally putting on glasses after spending years thinking slightly blurry vision was normal. You don't realize how much you were struggling until you experience what it's like without that constant weight on your shoulders.

The fact that you're able to distinguish between your authentic self and your anxiety now is huge. That awareness is really valuable and can help you maintain better mental health going forward. You might even discover new aspects of your personality that were previously overshadowed by anxiety.

Don't feel bad about not recognizing the extent of your anxiety before - that's incredibly common. What matters is that you took the step to get help when you needed it. I'm really glad you're finding relief with medication and getting to experience life with a clearer mind.","

bd4pu0,Anxiety,Does anyone else think up scenarios of how things will play out and get extremely worked up and anxious about it?,ConventionalizedSoy,Any help or advice would be great,1281,110,1555260526,‚ÄúWe suffer more in imagination than in reality.‚Äù  is a great quote I‚Äôm trying to be more mindful of.,182,OhhLawd,"All the time. Last year when my anxiety went through the roof, and depression took a hold of me (I still have depression, but much much less than last year), I had to plan out everything from getting out of my apartment to which bus I was going to take to go to college to what streets I would walk on. It was horrible. I still plan out a lot of things though. For example, tomorrow I'm planning on going to Starbucks after college to grab a coffee and read a book. 

When I get worked up on whether I'll be able to make it to a certain place I try to relax and have deep a breath. I usually head out a while early just so I have peace of mind that I'll get there on time.

If you want to talk about it privately you can private message me :)",13,Mr_Phantoms,"Yes, this is actually a really common form of anxiety called ""catastrophizing"" - where your mind creates these elaborate worst-case scenarios and makes them feel super real. I do this too, and it can be exhausting!

Something that helps me is reminding myself that my brain is trying to protect me by preparing for every possibility, but it's going overboard. Most of the scenarios we imagine never actually happen, or if they do, they're usually not nearly as bad as we pictured.

Try this: When you catch yourself spiraling into these scenarios, pause and ask ""Is this actually likely to happen? What's a more realistic outcome?"" Also, focus on what's happening right now, in this moment. Deep breathing or grounding exercises (like naming 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, etc.) can help pull you back to reality.

If these thoughts are seriously impacting your daily life, talking to a therapist can be really helpful - they can teach you specific techniques to manage this kind of anxiety.

Most people don't realize how those words can affect others and are usually pretty understanding when you explain.

It's also helped me to remind myself of exactly what you said - 99% of the time it's something completely manageable like being out of garlic powder or having to reschedule plans.

bl28b0,Anxiety,"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?",MermaidZombie,"This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits.",1310,79,1557086213,Wow you just described how I feel to a T.,149,blessedbiscuit,Yup I‚Äôve always noticed that people treat me differently.

The truth is, your self-consciousness is likely making you hyper-aware of every interaction, causing you to overthink things that others do naturally.

Here's something that helped me: start small. Instead of trying to match others' level of banter or physical comfort right away, work on gradually letting your guard down. Maybe start by sharing a genuine opinion about something you're passionate about, or laughing freely when something is actually funny to you. People often mirror the energy we put out - if you're always careful and reserved, they'll respond in kind.

Also, remember that being the ""polite, nice"" friend isn't a bad thing - it's just your current comfort zone. But comfort zones can expand with practice. Try occasionally joining in when others are joking around, even if it feels awkward at first. Most people are too focused on themselves to judge you as harshly as you're judging yourself.

You're not weird or childish - you're just someone who processes social situations differently, and that's okay.","

While Mazzy Star and temporary escapism can be comforting (and ""Fade Into You"" is perfect for those late-night feels), try not to let this turn into an all-nighter. Being sleep-deprived will only make tomorrow's conversations and studying harder to handle.

Maybe try breaking things into smaller chunks? Like, instead of thinking about the whole job situation, just focus on planning what you want to say in the conversation. Write some key points down if it helps. Same with studying - even 20 minutes of focused work now is better than nothing.

I fell into that rabbit hole last year and it only made my anxiety 100x worse. Every little twinge became a potential catastrophe because Dr. Google always suggests it's either cancer or a brain tumor.

What helped me was setting a rule: If a symptom bothers me for more than 2 weeks, I call my actual doctor. If it's less than that, I write it in my notes app and try to forget about it. Most minor things resolve on their own, and having that ""2-week rule"" helps me avoid the panic spiral while still being responsible about my health.

Also worth mentioning - medical websites are designed to cover ALL possibilities, even the super rare ones. They're not taking into account your age, health history, or lifestyle. Your doctor can actually put symptoms in context and give you relevant advice.

Your mental health is important too, and constantly assuming the worst is exhausting. Take care of yourself, but don't let Dr. Google become your primary physician!","

My parents said I was lazy, my friends thought I was depressed. Nope, I just really love sleep because it's like a vacation for me. And I think being anxious all the time really does make you tired. It's incredibly draining. To me, being tired from being anxious feels exactly the same like feeling tired from medication. Kinda fuzzy, warm and it's nearly impossible to keep my eyes open. The only thing that's helping me is staying busy, which means that even in my freetime I'll constantly do stuff because if I don't, I either worry about the stuff I should be doing or fall asleep and worry even more when I wake up again. This lifestyle is working for me, for now. I honestly don't know what I'll do when I'm older and simply can't function on the level I'm at now. I don't have any experience with anxiety medication so I can't really say if there's a medical way to fix this. Occupational Therapy can help though. I hope you'll get better ‚ù£Ô∏è",2,misanthropichell,"I totally get this. Sleep can feel like the only escape from that constant anxiety buzz - especially the physical symptoms that just won't quit. It's like hitting a pause button on all those overwhelming sensations.

But using sleep as your main coping mechanism can become problematic over time. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can teach you techniques to manage those physical symptoms while you're awake. Things like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness have helped me a lot with similar issues.

Also, regular exercise (even just walking) can help burn off some of that anxious energy and reduce physical tension. It sounds counterintuitive when all you want to do is sleep, but it really does help.

You're not alone in feeling this way. Anxiety is exhausting, both mentally and physically. Just remember that while sleep provides temporary relief, working on managing anxiety while awake will give you better long-term results. Be gentle with yourself as you figure this out. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

While society often pushes the narrative that everyone should chase dynamic ""dream jobs,"" the reality is that many people thrive better with routine and clear expectations.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with preferring stability in your work life. Having a job where you know exactly what's expected lets you build confidence through mastery and reduces daily stress. Plus, predictable work often allows you to have better work-life balance since you're not constantly dealing with unexpected challenges or bringing work stress home.

Think about it this way - if your job provides stability and peace of mind, that actually gives you more mental energy to pursue passions and excitement in other areas of your life when YOU choose to. Not everyone needs or wants their primary source of income to also be their biggest source of daily stimulation.

Your anxiety about unpredictable work is totally valid. Focus on finding a role that matches your comfort level with routine versus variety - there's no one-size-fits-all approach to job satisfaction.","

I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan.

Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing.

The way you handled that high-pressure situation in the OR shows just how effective those CBT techniques can be when you really commit to practicing them.

I love that you emphasized getting professional help - it's so important for people to understand that seeking therapy and taking medication isn't a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength and self-awareness. You're absolutely right that no one should have to face anxiety alone.

Your journey from being unable to leave your room to now performing critical roles in surgery is remarkable. But what's even more valuable is how you're using your experience to reach out and help others. That's truly admirable.

Keep crushing it! Stories like yours give hope to others who might be in that dark place you once were. And thank you for being so open about your ongoing maintenance with therapy and meds - it helps normalize that recovery is often a continuous journey rather than a destination.","

fbq6n2,Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),berghain_s_1993,"Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?",1300,78,1583044265,"Very much struggling with this now. I spend all day at home studying, but when I get invited out, I just think about how nice it would be to stay home. Social interactions are exhausting",123,[deleted],"I have this same problem. I am definitely a homebody but lately I have just been spending too much time at home and am starting to feel a bit lonely. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I am super paranoid about this virus going around so I‚Äôm even more reluctant to stay home. BUT, I have just been trying to do 1-2 small things every today. Like today I took my dogs on a nice walk and cleaned my room. Not huge tasks but I am proud I at least did something productive :-) I say just do some small things every day. They will build up. Also, I think we are all so hard on ourselves about this kind of stuff. We don‚Äôt need to be super busy all the time. It‚Äôs ok to just take it easy (in moderation of course).",12,theverticalgiraffe,"I totally get this - you're caught in that frustrating cycle where loneliness and isolation feed into each other. It's not laziness at all; this sounds like depression and anxiety working together to keep you stuck. The harder it becomes to go out or do basic tasks, the more overwhelming everything feels, which makes you withdraw more.

Maybe try breaking things into tiny steps? Instead of thinking about a full dinner out (which does sound exhausting!), could you start with just checking your mail or taking a 5-minute walk around your building? Small wins can help build momentum.

Also, your childhood experience makes total sense - when you grow up without seeing regular socializing modeled at home, it's harder to develop those patterns naturally as an adult. You're not broken or lazy; you're dealing with legitimate mental health challenges that were partly shaped by your upbringing.

Consider talking to a therapist if you can - they can help you understand these patterns and develop better coping strategies. In the meantime, be gentle with yourself. This is way more common than you might think.","

When it comes to messaging, I always feel like I've done something to offend my friends or something. Like, if they dont respond to my messages after a while, I start to feel like I did something wrong and now they hate me. Or whenever I call and they dont answer, I feel like they dont want to talk to me anymore. The obvious and logical answer is that they're busy, but anxiety doesn't give a fuck about logic. Right now, one of my friends hasn't messaged me back in about a week, and my anxiety just tells me stuff like, ""What if they're not busy and just ignoring me because they hate me."" That's my biggest anxiety problem right now. And then I start to get worried that I'm too clingy and that makes my anxiety worse, making me hate everything.

It's still something I'm working on, but it's always nice to talk to someone who will tell you you're overthinking (in a nice way). I have a friend who also has anxiety but in a very different way, and we're always consulting each other so that we don't overthink too much. That being said, I still do it a lot, and it may be counterintuitive to have to rely on someone to check your thoughts. I don't have any great advice but I just wanted you to know you're not alone.",104,erodedfacade,"Ask yourself why you really want to be around this person. - They haven't bothered to check in/ see what's up/ shoot the shit lately?   They genuinely might be too busy, but if I ever find myself asking why someone isn't getting back to me, I conclude it doesn't matter. If they call back, great. If not - I've got more important things to brood over. I imagine you do too. 

Let out a breath and say fuck 'em. Not worth your time? They're definitely not worth mine. Don't hold a grudge though. People are allowed to have feelings and opinions. If you find people that don't like you - do not strive for approval. Consider it a plus - one less person to worry about. Frees up precious space to worry about other things.",30,StockHuman,"I struggle with this exact same thing, and it's exhausting. That spiral of ""they hate me ‚Üí I'm being clingy ‚Üí now they definitely hate me"" is so real, and anxiety really does throw logic right out the window.

Something that's helped me is remembering that my anxious thoughts aren't facts - they're just stories my brain makes up to fill in the blanks. Most people are just wrapped up in their own lives, dealing with work, family stuff, or just needing some quiet time. It rarely has anything to do with us.

Try to be gentle with yourself. Having anxiety about friendships doesn't make you clingy - it makes you human. Maybe set some small challenges for yourself, like waiting an extra day before following up on messages, or reminding yourself of times when friends were ""missing"" but then came back naturally.

And if it's really impacting your daily life, talking to a therapist can be super helpful. They can give you specific tools to manage these thoughts. You're definitely not alone in this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Pro tip: Everyone almost hits curbs when they're learning! Even experienced drivers have their moments. The important thing is that you kept going instead of letting it shake your confidence.

I started learning at 23 and was terrified at first, but it gets so much easier with each lesson. Your body starts to develop muscle memory, and things that seem overwhelming now will become second nature before you know it.

But its still terrifying every time. I hate panic attacks.",1284,91,1565630035,"Couldn‚Äôt agree more with this! ‚ÄúHey, that pain in my arm wasnt actually a heart attack‚Äù *3 months later, pain in arm* ‚ÄúHoly shit it‚Äôs a heart attack*",190,driskal360,,0,,"I feel this so deeply. The logical part of your brain is like ""hey, you've been through this exact thing 100 times and survived"" but the panic part is screaming ""BUT WHAT IF THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT?!""

One thing that's helped me a bit is actually leaning into that thought you mentioned - recognizing that the panic attack itself is proof that my body's ""alarm system"" is working, even if it's being oversensitive. When I feel one coming on, I try to tell myself ""Ah, there's my overprotective brain doing its thing again. Thanks for trying to keep me safe, but we're actually okay.""

It doesn't make the physical symptoms magically disappear, but reframing it as my body being overprotective rather than something being seriously wrong has helped take some of the edge off. Still sucks every single time though, and you're totally valid in feeling frustrated about it. Sending you strength - we're all in this together. üíú","

jkugv8,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel a massive surge in anxiety and hopelessness when the weather turns all dark and gloomy? Once autumn kicks in properly I just feel like my life‚Äôs about to end,lilly_bean,Edit-thanks everyone for all the comments and hugs. I got so many useful tips!!,1192,183,1604054635,"It's the other way for me. Maybe I feel like gloomy weather matches my reality and sunny weather feels like the world telling me I don't belong here, because I'm not as ""sunny"" as a person.",322,AggressiveYuumi,Sounds like you have S.A.D... have you seen your doctor?,75,[deleted],"Yes, what you're describing sounds like Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and it's way more common than most people realize! I deal with this every year too - that heavy feeling when the days get shorter and darker is rough.

A few things that have helped me cope:
- Getting a light therapy lamp and using it first thing in the morning for 20-30 mins
- Taking Vitamin D supplements (check with your doctor first)
- Forcing myself to get outside during daylight hours, even on cloudy days
- Setting up my workspace near windows for natural light
- Planning fun indoor activities/hobbies to look forward to during the darker months

The hopelessness you're feeling is totally valid, but remember it's temporary and tied to the season. Your life isn't ending - your brain is just responding to the environmental change. If it's seriously impacting your daily life, talking to a mental health professional can be really helpful too. They can provide strategies specifically for managing seasonal depression.

Hang in there! Spring will come again, and in the meantime, be gentle with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I understand as humans there is a desire to make things/ be creative but having that tied to the necessities of living a healthy life,( money) may not be what we are made to do.",8,coraltrek,"I totally get this. Work anxiety is something I've struggled with too, and it can feel like this massive cloud hanging over everything else in life. That Sunday evening dread is real.

But I've found it helpful to dig deeper into what specifically about work triggers the anxiety - is it the workload, difficult coworkers, fear of failure, or something else? Sometimes just identifying the root causes can help us address them more effectively.

Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in workplace anxiety? They can provide really practical coping strategies. Even small changes like setting better boundaries, taking proper lunch breaks, or practicing mindfulness techniques can make a huge difference.

That said, don't feel guilty about these feelings - they're incredibly common. While most of us do need to work to live, we can work on making our relationship with work healthier. Maybe that means looking for a less stressful job, negotiating better conditions, or developing stronger outside-of-work interests to balance things out.

You're definitely not alone in this. Work shouldn't consume our whole emotional wellbeing.","

I miss so much work sometimes cause it gets hard to manage sometimes,48,majidjaxn,"As someone who deals with anxiety too, I found that driving commercial vehicles actually helps manage my symptoms sometimes - there's something oddly calming about having clear procedures and routines to follow. 

I work in IT now, and while it can be stressful at times, having the option to work remotely on high-anxiety days has been a game-changer. I've noticed lots of anxious folks tend to gravitate toward jobs that either:
1. Offer clear structure and predictable patterns
2. Allow for some independence/control over their environment
3. Don't require constant face-to-face interaction

The key is finding what works for YOUR specific anxiety triggers. Some thrive in solo roles while others need enough social interaction to stay out of their head. There's no one-size-fits-all solution.

Props to you for keeping it real and starting this conversation. It's always comforting to know we're not alone in this struggle. Keep taking care of yourself and remember that having anxiety doesn't make you any less capable - it just means we have to be a bit more strategic about our choices. üí™","

As someone who also struggled with anxiety and panic attacks, I know exactly how overwhelming and paralyzing they can be. The fact that you not only went back to complete your academics but crushed it with a 90% average shows amazing resilience.

It's especially inspiring that you didn't let your earlier challenges define your future. A lot of people don't realize that there's no ""right"" timeline for education - you took the time you needed to work on your mental health and came back stronger. That's actually a really mature approach.

One piece of advice: Most colleges have great counseling services and disability support offices. Don't hesitate to connect with them early, even if you're feeling good now. Having those resources already lined up can be super helpful during stressful times like midterms.

You've already proven you can overcome huge obstacles. College will have its challenges, but you've got this! Keep being proud of yourself - this is a major achievement.","

You're absolutely right - surviving each day with anxiety is an achievement in itself, even though it might not always feel that way. I've learned that being gentle with ourselves during the tough days is just as important as celebrating the good ones.

One thing that's helped me is reframing anxiety as a part of me that's trying to be protective (even if it's overreacting) rather than seeing it as the enemy. It doesn't make it go away, but it helps me respond with less self-judgment.

Your reminder about taking it one day at a time is so important. Sometimes just focusing on getting through the next hour is all we can do, and that's okay.

This is one of my top 5 anxiety triggers. I've found that by thinking too far ahead like this, I speed up time and am almost always getting to that point quicker the more I think about it. So I think about/plan for the short term. I kind of force myself to ""comfortably"" think about tomorrow on a small scale. Like what I might eat for breakfast, what outfit I might wear, what I'll be working on at work. Small things that put me more closer to the now that I can control most of the time.",278,40ozFreed,"I just use Gandalf as a role model and imagine that as I get older I'll obtain more esoteric wisdom and picture myself in the library of my future house surrounded by books, maps, and items from my travels, with age churning me like a fine cheese into sophistication.",104,blankmarks,"I totally get this feeling. I've had many sleepless nights thinking about aging and mortality - it's a completely normal human experience to grapple with these thoughts. The fact that you're thinking deeply about it shows you're a contemplative person.

What's helped me is shifting focus to making the most of the time we do have. Instead of seeing aging as just decline, try to view it as gaining experiences, wisdom, and meaningful relationships along the way. Every stage of life can bring its own kind of beauty and purpose.

Some practical things that help me when these thoughts get overwhelming:
- Focusing on building healthy habits now that will serve me well later
- Spending quality time with loved ones of all ages
- Finding meaning in leaving a positive impact, however small
- Talking to older people who are living fulfilling lives

Remember, anxiety about aging is something countless people deal with. You're not alone in these feelings. If these thoughts become too distressing, speaking with a counselor can really help provide perspective and coping strategies.","

I‚Äôve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I‚Äôve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back.

I also throw myself into asthma attacks from my panic attacks.

I‚Äôve been managing this to some degree with medication, breathing, and CBT techniques, but most of the times it‚Äôs so bad a combination of those three take a bit of time to work.

Going to be seeing a doctor soon to adjust my medication. Long road, but hopefully will help. Good luck to you as well; anxiety is a bitch to deal with.",33,eyesofbutterflies,"You're definitely not alone in experiencing physical symptoms from anxiety. I deal with similar issues - nausea and stomach problems are my body's favorite way of manifesting stress. It's actually really common for anxiety to show up physically like this because our bodies respond to mental stress as if it were a physical threat.

Have you tried any grounding techniques when you feel the anxiety building? I find that focusing on slow breathing (4 counts in, 4 counts hold, 4 counts out) can help interrupt the anxiety spiral before it gets to the point of making me sick. Progressive muscle relaxation has helped me too.

For social events specifically, it sometimes helps me to have an ""escape plan"" - knowing I can step outside for air or leave early if needed takes some pressure off. And remember, most people at a bridal shower are focused on the bride and themselves, not judging others.

Be gentle with yourself. Taking a step back sometimes is normal in recovery. You're doing the right things by seeking help and working on this. Sending you support! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

The reality is that anxiety/depression (or whatever you're dealing with) makes these normal activities genuinely challenging, even if we wish they weren't.

Try to be gentle with yourself though. You're not choosing for this to be hard - your brain is just wired differently right now. The fact that you pushed through despite it being difficult shows real strength, even if it doesn't feel that way.

I hope that one day grocery shopping becomes easier for you. Until then, maybe look into some strategies that could help reduce the friction - like ordering pickup/delivery when possible, going during quiet hours, or making a very specific list so you can get in and out quickly. Small adjustments can make these necessary tasks a bit more manageable.

As if I'm the one responsible for fixing everyone's problems (even the ones that only exist in my head). It is stupid and exhausting.",207,CardinalPeeves,,0,,"I totally get this. It's called being an ""empath"" - where you deeply feel and absorb others' emotions, even strangers. I sometimes catch myself creating entire stories in my head about someone who looks sad at the grocery store or sitting alone at a restaurant, and it can be really overwhelming.

While having strong empathy is a beautiful trait, it's important to develop healthy boundaries so it doesn't drain you emotionally. Something that helps me is reminding myself that:
1. Not everyone sitting alone is actually lonely - many people enjoy solitude
2. I can acknowledge someone's possible pain without taking it on as my own burden
3. Being overly empathetic to strangers sometimes means I have less emotional energy for those closest to me

Try practicing some gentle self-talk when these feelings come up: ""I see them, I care, but I can't carry everyone's pain."" Maybe channel that empathy into actual actions when you can (volunteering, random acts of kindness) while still protecting your own emotional wellbeing.

You're not alone in feeling this way - it's actually a sign of a compassionate heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Something that's helped me is starting really small. Instead of feeling guilty about not maintaining full conversations, I'll just send a meme or funny photo to a friend with no pressure for a big chat. Or I'll reply with simple reactions/emojis to their social media posts. These micro-interactions help keep the connection alive without triggering that intense anxiety.

Also, try to be gentle with yourself about this. A lot of people struggle with social anxiety and friendship maintenance - you're not broken or a bad friend. Maybe let your closer friends know you sometimes get overwhelmed with messaging but still care about them. Real friends will understand.

POST TITLE: Does anyone else sit and watch friendships fade bc the thought of reaching out or txting back is too overwhelming?

POST BODY: So I have this thing where I get really severe anxiety when it comes to messaging people or meeting up to hang. I honestly don‚Äôt know why or what triggers it, but ik I have missed out on a lot of opportunities to befriend lovely people and I have let friendships fizzle because I didn‚Äôt put in the effort. 

I‚Äôm just super lonely now and it sucks, I love the people in my life. But for some reason I can‚Äôt explain I just freak out so much when it comes to actually talking to them and it just feels like an effort unless I‚Äôm drunk :|.

I've dealt with anxiety too, and I know how paralyzing it can be. What helped me was building on small victories exactly like this one. Maybe next time you could try 8 minutes, or visit the same store at a different time of day. No pressure though - go at whatever pace feels right for you.

The fact that you're sharing this shows you want to keep making progress. That motivation, combined with the courage you showed yesterday, is really powerful. You've got this, and it's totally okay to take it one small trip at a time.

Keep celebrating these victories - they matter more than you know. Rooting for you! üí™","

There are people making fun of me for it.  I know it's the internet.  Trolls mainly.  I don't pay them any attention.  But I did realize I do that.

Is it just me?",1253,111,1620820700,I do it aswell mate sometimes sometimes I can‚Äôt form complete sentences and sometimes I think I‚Äôm having a stroke (I‚Äôm not btw) it‚Äôs all my anxiety my brain is thinking to much I‚Äôm then not paying attention to what I‚Äôm actually saying,145,DannyThomson1875,"I get that too - although I'm not sure if it's anxiety related or my ADHD. (got diagnosed w ADHD 3 weeks ago, in the diagnostic report my psychiatrist wrote that I present with mild anxiety, not a formal diagnosis though.)

I had an online tutorial for uni just a couple hours ago, and I had volunteered to share my thoughts on the topic. Tutor asked me to explain how I got to those findings, and I felt pretty stressed because that made me think that I'd gotten it all wrong. Before he asked me that I was speaking pretty well, but after I was stuttering a lot and couldn't organise my thoughts. I knew what words I wanted to say but I couldn't make a sentence from them in the moment. (Luckily, he seemed to understand what I was trying to say and agreed with me anyway).

I don't really know how to get around it. When it happens to me, like at work/ uni/ with friends/whatever, I usually just apologise to who I'm speaking to and try to think of the words I want without saying anything, like I'm doing a factory reset of myself.

It sucks that people make fun of you for it, but I'm glad you're not paying them attention.",14,king_of_sheep,"You're definitely not alone in this. Anxiety and stress can absolutely affect our ability to communicate clearly - it's actually a pretty common symptom. When we're stressed, our brain is in ""fight or flight"" mode, which can make it harder to organize our thoughts and express them coherently.

I experience something similar when I'm put on the spot or discussing topics that make me uncomfortable. My sentences become choppy and fragmented, kind of like what you described.

A few things that help me:
- Taking a deep breath before responding
- Slowing down when speaking/typing
- Writing out complex thoughts beforehand if possible
- Reminding myself that it's okay to take time to gather my thoughts

Don't let the trolls get to you. They're just looking for reactions and probably deal with their own insecurities. Focus on communicating at your own pace and with people who actually want to have meaningful conversations.

If it really bothers you, you might want to talk to a therapist - they can provide strategies specifically for managing anxiety-related communication issues.","

I dealt with this too after having some really toxic work environments in the past. Those experiences can definitely leave lasting effects on how we approach work, even in better situations.

A few things that helped me:
- Creating a solid after-work routine that I actually look forward to (gaming, exercise, hobby)
- Setting boundaries around work thoughts (no checking emails after hours)
- Planning something nice for Monday evenings to have a ""light at the end of the tunnel""

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? Since you mentioned having diagnosed anxiety, they might be able to help you process those past negative experiences and develop better coping strategies.

Remember: being home should be your safe space to decompress. You deserve to enjoy your time off without that constant dread hanging over you. Be gentle with yourself - healing from bad work experiences takes time.","

Thank you for this gentle reminder. It's amazing how often we forget to just... breathe. I actually felt my shoulders drop and tension release that I didn't even realize I was holding.

You're right - we're alive, and that simple fact is pretty remarkable when you think about it. Sometimes we get so caught up in our daily stresses and to-do lists that we forget to pause and just exist for a moment.

For anyone reading this: taking intentional deep breaths isn't just feel-good advice - it actually triggers your parasympathetic nervous system to help calm your body and mind. Even just one mindful breath can help reset your perspective a bit.

Thanks for being that little voice of kindness today. I needed that. üå±","

I do the same thing - it's actually a really common physiological response to stress and anxiety. Those deep sighs are called ""spontaneous sighing"" and research shows they help regulate our breathing patterns and emotional state. It's basically your body's natural reset button.

I understand how challenging it must be dealing with this in Korea where it's considered rude. Perhaps you could try explaining to those close to you that it's an involuntary stress-management technique, not a sign of rudeness or displeasure. For situations where you need an alternative, you might try:

- Taking slow, deliberate breaths through your nose
- Quietly counting your breaths
- Stepping away briefly when you need to release tension
- Progressive muscle relaxation

But don't be too hard on yourself about this. Your body developed this coping mechanism for a reason, and while it's good to be culturally sensitive, your mental health needs are important too. Maybe work with a counselor to develop other anxiety management techniques that are both effective and culturally appropriate?","

I know exactly what you're describing and have experienced this myself. It's like your head feels ""fuzzy"" or like there's a physical barrier between you and reality, even though you can think and function normally. It's a really unsettling sensation.

What you're describing sounds like depersonalization/derealization, which is actually a pretty common anxiety symptom. When we're stressed or anxious, our brain can go into a protective mode that creates this disconnected feeling. It's uncomfortable but not dangerous.

Things that have helped me:
- Grounding exercises (focus on physical sensations, name 5 things you can see/hear/touch)
- Regular exercise and good sleep
- Reducing caffeine intake
- Mindfulness practices

The most important thing is trying not to fear the sensation itself. Like you mentioned, worrying about it creates a cycle that makes it worse. Remember that it's temporary and will pass. If it's significantly impacting your life, consider talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety - they can provide specific techniques to manage these episodes.

It's incredibly dismissive when people treat anxiety and panic disorders like they're just a bad mood that can be fixed with a few deep breaths or a jog around the block. While those things can be helpful tools as part of a broader treatment plan, they're not magic solutions to a very real medical condition.

You're absolutely right - this is about brain chemistry, not just ""negative thinking."" And having people minimize that or make you feel guilty for not ""trying hard enough"" only adds to the stress and isolation.

Have you found a therapist or doctor who actually specializes in anxiety disorders? The right professional support can make a huge difference, since they actually understand what you're going through and can help develop coping strategies that work for YOUR specific situation. Not generic advice from well-meaning but clueless people.

Hang in there. Your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in this struggle. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for having a legitimate medical condition that requires real treatment.","

When life feels overwhelming, bed becomes this safe cocoon where everything else just fades away for a bit. It's actually a pretty common response - our bodies and minds sometimes need that retreat to feel protected and comfortable.

While there's nothing wrong with needing these breaks, it's worth paying attention to how often you're feeling this way. If it's becoming your main coping strategy or interfering with important responsibilities, it might be worth exploring some additional ways to handle stress.

Maybe try setting a timer when you retreat to bed - give yourself that comfort but with a planned endpoint. Or create a cozy ""recharge station"" somewhere else in your home, like a comfy chair with some plants and good lighting, so you're not always associating bed with escape.

But don't beat yourself up about needing these moments. We all have our ways of coping with life's pressures. The key is finding a balance between giving yourself the comfort you need while still staying engaged with your daily life.","

It's called ""social anxiety replay"" or sometimes ""cringe attacks,"" where your brain loves to replay social interactions and make them seem way worse than they actually were.

Here's the thing: most people are way too focused on their own lives and concerns to remember or judge your ""awkward"" moments. That comment you're obsessing over? Your boss probably forgot about it 5 minutes later.

Something that helps me is remembering that everyone has these moments - even that super confident person you know. Try asking yourself: ""Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?"" Usually, the answer is no.

If you find yourself in these thought spirals often, try redirecting your mind by:
- Writing down what you're proud of from the day
- Focusing on your breathing for a few minutes
- Reminding yourself that being perfectly polished all the time isn't realistic or necessary

Be kind to yourself - you're probably doing much better than you think! üíú","

Been dealing with my mentally ill, alcoholic mom for over a month. I haven't had a really nice, normal poop in awhile.",26,Sterngirl,"This is actually super common and you're definitely not alone! The gut-brain connection is very real - anxiety triggers your fight-or-flight response, which can mess with your digestive system and send you running to the bathroom. It's part of why people talk about having ""butterflies"" or feeling sick to their stomach when nervous.

Some things that help me manage this:
- Planning extra time before events that make me anxious
- Deep breathing exercises (sounds clich√© but it really helps calm the nervous system)
- Avoiding caffeine when I'm already feeling anxious
- Taking Imodium if I know I have a stressful event coming up

Also, don't be embarrassed about it. Anxiety poops are a thing that tons of people deal with, even if they don't talk about it openly. Your body is just doing its thing, annoying as it may be. If it's seriously impacting your life though, talking to a doctor about anxiety management could be worth exploring.

Spending that much money only to have technical difficulties eat up the entire session is incredibly disappointing, especially after waiting a whole year to find an available therapist.

I'd strongly encourage you to email the therapist explaining the connection issues and request either a partial refund or a make-up session. Most ethical therapists would be understanding about this situation since you received virtually no therapeutic value from the appointment. You could also ask if they have alternatives - some therapists have phone sessions as a backup option when video fails.

If they're not responsive to making it right, I'd consider finding someone else. Yes, the wait times suck, but you deserve to actually receive the care you're paying for. Maybe ask specifically about their video setup and connection quality when screening new therapists.

Hang in there. It's really discouraging when technology gets in the way of getting help, but don't let this one bad experience stop you from trying again.","

Those random moments when your brain decides to replay that embarrassing thing from high school or that fight with an ex from years ago... yeah, I get those too.

What helped me was realizing these intrusive memories aren't necessarily trying to torture us - sometimes they're our brain's way of processing stuff we haven't fully dealt with yet. One trick I learned is to acknowledge the memory but then consciously redirect your thoughts. Like ""Yep, that happened, but it's in the past and I'm a different person now.""

If you find these thoughts becoming really frequent or distressing, talking to a therapist can be super helpful. They can give you specific techniques to manage these moments.

But honestly, just know you're not alone in this. It's a very human thing to randomly revisit old wounds. The key is not letting those past moments define your present.","

I became slowly more shy and anxious every year, I would say by age 12 the anxiety kind of climaxed into being truly terrible. We always look at the past with rose colored glasses on. I know for me personally, I try to remind myself that I had more freedom but less agency, and being an adult I can actually do what I need to do to change my life so I can ease my anxiety. Didn't have that option as a kid. Maybe you can relate?",153,[deleted],Yeah ...my childhood was very traumatic so i also can't relate,2,baby_3pac_1985,"I totally relate to this. As a kid, I was constantly worried about what others thought, analyzing every social interaction, and feeling anxious about things most kids probably never even considered. It wasn't just normal shyness - it was like having an overactive radar for potential judgment or mistakes.

You're definitely not alone in this. While some people had carefree childhoods, others of us were dealing with anxiety from a really young age. It's great that you've gotten therapy and are doing better now - that's a huge achievement and shows real strength in recognizing and working on these issues.

I think sometimes when people romanticize childhood as this completely carefree time, they forget that mental health challenges don't wait for adulthood to show up. Some of us were just wired this way from early on, and that's okay. The important thing is that you're taking care of yourself and making progress. It's actually really encouraging to hear that you're doing better now - it shows that growth and healing are possible, even if we didn't have that stereotypical ""carefree childhood"" experience.","

You're absolutely right about the media though - they thrive on keeping everyone on edge. Best thing to do is step back, take breaks from the news, and remember that regardless of the outcome, the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most of the catastrophic scenarios they're pushing probably won't happen.

For anyone feeling overwhelmed (American or not), try to focus on your immediate life and what you can control. Go for a walk, call a friend, watch something funny - whatever helps you decompress. The results will come when they come, and stressing won't make them come any faster.

While caffeine affects everyone differently, you make a really valid point about its relationship with anxiety especially. When I cut back on coffee, I noticed my anxiety levels dropped significantly too.

That said, I think it's worth mentioning that going cold turkey isn't always necessary for everyone. Some people do well with gradually reducing intake or switching to green tea which has less caffeine but still provides some benefits. The key is paying attention to how it affects YOU personally.

For anyone considering cutting back - watch out for withdrawal headaches in the first few days. Try tapering down slowly and staying hydrated. The first week can be rough but many people report better sleep, more stable energy, and less anxiety once they adjust.

Glad you found what works for you! Posts like this are important reminders that sometimes the simplest changes can have the biggest impact on our wellbeing.","

Here's a tip that helps me: When you first put your headphones on, take them off once and place them on a table/surface while they're playing. This lets you hear exactly how much sound actually leaks out (usually very little). It can help give you peace of mind for the rest of your listening session.

Also, remember that if your music was actually bothering someone, most people would politely let you know. We tend to overthink these things way more than necessary. It's great that you're considerate of others, but try not to let it interrupt your enjoyment too much! üéß","

As someone who struggles with social anxiety, it's so important to recognize that these ""small"" victories aren't small at all. Every time we push ourselves outside our comfort zone, we're literally rewiring our brains to be a little braver next time.

I've learned that awkwardness isn't failure - it's practice. Those cringy moments that keep us up at night? They're just evidence that we're growing and trying new things. The alternative is staying safely in our bubble, which feels comfortable but ultimately holds us back.

Something that helps me is remembering that most people are too focused on their own anxieties to notice our awkward moments. And those who do notice? They're usually more impressed by our courage to try than focused on our imperfect execution.

Edit: [Here is the song](https://youtu.be/lTKrmuU0C3s)",92,Leonhart_13,,0,,"Yes! I completely relate to this. There's actually a scientific reason behind why rain makes many of us feel calm and peaceful. The steady sound of rainfall is what's called ""pink noise"" - similar to white noise but more natural - and it has been shown to help reduce anxiety and promote relaxation in our brains.

I also think there's something comforting about rainy days that gives us permission to slow down. When it's sunny, there's often this pressure to be productive or go out, but rain creates this cozy, protected feeling where it's perfectly okay to just exist and be still.

If you really enjoy the rain's calming effects, you might want to try some rain sound apps or videos when you're feeling anxious on dry days. I personally use them for sleep and meditation. There's also something called ""pluviophile"" - it means someone who finds peace and joy in rainy days. Sounds like you might be one! 

You're definitely not alone in this feeling. Some of my best memories and most peaceful moments have been during rainfall. üåßÔ∏è","

amqy1o,Anxiety,Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.,quietwreck,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy. I‚Äôm allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. ",1276,60,1549210597,"It sounds like you have really sorted your life out. Well done, that's awesome. ",65,katiefeatherstone,"It sounds like you have really sorted your life out. Well done, that's awesome. ",65,katiefeatherstone,"This resonates so much with me! It's amazing how anxiety can become our ""comfort zone"" to the point where feeling genuinely happy almost feels suspicious. Congratulations on the 6 months panic attack-free and for taking the brave step to leave a job that wasn't serving you - those are huge wins!

What you said about not being used to emotional extremes really hit home. It's like our anxiety-wired brains have forgotten how to process ""normal"" emotions, so when they come along, we immediately try to pathologize them. But you're absolutely right - you ARE allowed to feel the full spectrum of emotions, including happiness and anger.

Keep celebrating these victories and remember that learning to trust positive emotions is part of the recovery journey. Your body and mind are gradually remembering what it feels like to just... be. And that's beautiful, not scary (even though it might feel that way sometimes).

You're doing amazing work with your recovery, and it shows. Keep going! üí™","

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy. I‚Äôm allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too.

r23gzk,Anxiety,Do you ever just wear yourself out with your own thoughts?,Salt-Seaworthiness91,I feel so tired,1219,115,1637866127,Every second of every day. So many voices. üòì,153,howboutnoskott,,0,,"I know exactly what you mean. Mental exhaustion from overthinking and getting caught in thought spirals can be just as draining as physical tiredness - sometimes even more so.

Something that helps me is treating my mind like a browser with too many tabs open. Sometimes you need to consciously ""close"" some of those tabs by either:
- Writing your thoughts down to get them out of your head
- Doing something physical to change your state (even a 5-minute walk)
- Using grounding techniques (focus on 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, etc.)

It's totally normal to feel this way, but you don't have to stay stuck there. When my thoughts are wearing me out, I try to be gentle with myself and remember that thoughts are just thoughts - they'll pass like clouds if we let them.

Maybe take a break from whatever's occupying your mind right now. Do something simple that brings you peace, even if just for a few minutes. Your mental energy is valuable and you deserve that rest.","

mm8sxb,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel most of their anxiety would dissipate if society would just lay off?,ae516,The majority of my anxiety is driven by societal expectations. I don't have a license because I hate driving...an expectation that didn't even exist before the 1900s.

The pressure to be an extremely hard worker with some hot career is such bullshit to me.  I always have a ton of shame associated with my lack of a career, work ethic and having no money.

I also don‚Äôt have a license, I did learn for quite a while a few years back but the anxiety of it crippled me so I stopped and honestly I‚Äôm happier for it. I just feel like I should be able to drive by my age and should be able to afford my own home and nonsense like that üò©",67,Bilbo_Buggin,"I deeply relate to feeling overwhelmed by modern society's endless expectations. It's like we're all trying to fit into this rigid box that wasn't designed for actual human beings. The constant pressure to achieve, produce, and ""adult"" correctly can be absolutely exhausting.

Here's what's helped me: I've started viewing these expectations more as suggestions rather than rules. Can't drive? That's okay - plenty of people use alternatives. Struggling at work? Most people are just figuring it out as they go along too. The ""normal and put-together"" people you see are often just as anxious inside.

Have you considered finding ways to incorporate more of what feels natural to you into your life? Maybe joining a hiking group, learning about foraging, or finding a job that aligns better with your values? You don't have to reject society entirely, but you can create space within it that feels more authentic to you.

Remember: these societal expectations developed over just a tiny fraction of human history. There's nothing wrong with you for finding them challenging - you're just more aware of how unnatural some of these demands really are.","

You‚Äôre definitely not alone. It‚Äôs not foolproof and I certainly haven‚Äôt stopped doing it but one thing that might help is chewing gum or sucking on hard candy or something, keeps your mouth/teeth occupied.",134,radicalbats,"This is actually a really common anxiety-related behavior called cheek biting or chronic cheek biting disorder. I do this too, especially during stressful periods, and those sores are the worst! You're definitely not alone.

What's helped me reduce it:
- Chewing gum when I catch myself doing it
- Using a mouth guard at night (turns out I was doing it in my sleep too)
- Mindfulness exercises - whenever I notice I'm biting, I try to pause and take a few deep breaths
- Keeping my mouth busy with sugar-free hard candies or mints

The most important thing is treating the underlying anxiety though. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you develop better coping mechanisms. Also, try to be gentle with yourself - beating yourself up about it usually just creates more anxiety and makes the habit worse.

In the meantime, salt water rinses can help those sores heal faster, and vitamin E oil on your lips can help with the healing too.

Hang in there! With awareness and the right tools, this habit can definitely improve over time.","

I've been there - those times when anxiety makes you question your reality, when everything feels heavy and uncertain. It's like trying to swim through fog. But you're absolutely right - this state isn't permanent, even though it feels that way in the moment.

One thing that helps me is remembering that being strong doesn't mean feeling strong all the time. Real strength is continuing to move forward even when you're scared, even when you're unsure. It's okay to take things one breath at a time.

For anyone reading this who's struggling right now: Save these affirmations. Come back to them when things get dark. And remember that reaching out - whether to friends, family, or professionals - isn't a sign of weakness. It's a sign that you're taking care of yourself.

It used to be like that for me. I used to cry myself to sleep and contemplated bleak ends. 


But my life is finally on track. My relationship collapsed and my workload is higher than ever, but I finally began asking myself key questions like: *what do I want* and *what do I enjoy*. 


I found hobbies that I truly enjoy, realized that they don't actually require a high salary or gf, and am overall, finally overcoming some anxiety. ",187,DavidlikesPeace,"Sometimes, I call in sick to work and just lie in bed all day. I did this yesterday.",3,LeMoofinateur,"I feel this deeply. Been there myself - that soul-crushing cycle of work, crash, repeat where your whole existence feels like it's just running on fumes to make it to the next day. It's not really living, just surviving.

A few things that helped me break out of this pattern, even just a bit:
- Started taking a 15-minute walk after work before going home. Helps create a mental boundary between work and home life
- Picked one small thing to look forward to each day (could be as simple as a favorite snack or podcast)
- Gradually moved my bedtime earlier to get more actual rest instead of just collapse-sleep
- Talked to my doctor about fatigue (turned out I had vitamin D deficiency)

The system can really grind us down, but you deserve more than just existing for work. Start with tiny changes - they add up. And don't feel guilty about feeling this way - lots of us are in the same boat.

Sending strength your way. Hope you can find small ways to reclaim some energy and joy, even if it's just baby steps at first.","

I get similar issues when I'm really stressed, including cramps, nausea, and even IBS-like symptoms.

Some things that help me manage it:
- Deep breathing exercises, especially focusing on belly breathing
- Peppermint tea (super soothing for both anxiety and stomach issues)
- Light stretching or gentle yoga
- Using a heating pad on my stomach
- Sticking to bland, easily digestible foods when it's bad

The fact that the pain goes away when you're not anxious is actually a pretty good indicator that it's stress-related. Still, if it persists or gets worse, definitely check with a doctor just to rule out other issues.

Try to be gentle with yourself during this stressful time. Your body is just responding to the anxiety in a very normal (though uncomfortable) way. Hope you feel better soon! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

That constant inner monologue analyzing every little action and reaction is exhausting, isn't it? It's like having an overly critical narrator following you around, second-guessing everything you do.

What helped me was realizing that most people are way too focused on their own thoughts and actions to notice the little things we obsess over. That slightly awkward laugh or ""dumb"" joke you think ruined everything? They probably forgot about it 30 seconds later.

It's great that you're able to articulate this to your boyfriend - that's actually a really healthy step. Having supportive people who understand what you're going through can make a huge difference. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can teach you specific techniques to quiet that inner critic and help you feel more present in social situations instead of stuck in your head.

Remember, you're probably your own harshest critic. Most people are much more understanding and forgiving than that anxious voice would have you believe.","

Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",1227,93,1581453318,YAY!,36,captain_paws_tattoo,Congratulations,15,Jacek310,"Congratulations! As someone who also got their license later than most (24), I totally understand those test-day jitters. That shaky gas pedal feeling is so real! 

It's awesome that you pushed through your nerves and went for it anyway - that takes real courage. And now you never have to do that test again! Your edit with all those detailed tips about practicing the route and knowing where all the controls are is super helpful too. I wish I'd thought to do a mock test beforehand.

The best part about getting your license ""late"" is that you're probably a more mature and cautious driver than most teenagers. Plus, you really appreciate the freedom it gives you since you know what life is like without it.

Be proud of yourself - this is a huge milestone! And thanks for coming back to share those detailed tips. They'll definitely help others in the same situation. üöó","

Success isn't always about reaching the end goal perfectly. Sometimes it's about the small wins along the way, the lessons learned, and the strength built through trying. Every attempt, every small step forward, counts for something.

Whatever you're working towards, keep going. Be proud of yourself for showing up and putting in the effort. That's already more than many people do.

And remember - it's okay to adjust your path or take breaks when needed. Just don't give up on yourself. You've got this, and there are people rooting for you, even if we're just strangers on the internet. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

dk2os9,Anxiety,Does anyone else stay up all night because they're nervous about the next day?,wtfismynamee,I don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower. Idk how to explain it but I stay up till like 7am every night because I don't want the next day to be here yet. I also stay up because I feel like I have so much to do before going to sleep but then I end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?,1247,73,1571485555,"Yes. 
It's like my brain doesn't want the day to end and tries to trick himself by staying up.",132,janelanee,,0,,"I totally get this. It's like you're trying to hold onto the current day because facing tomorrow feels overwhelming. That feeling of ""I need to do things before bed"" but then just scrolling or watching videos instead - I've definitely been there.

But here's the thing - staying up super late is probably making everything harder. When you're sleep-deprived, everything feels more stressful and tasks seem more daunting, which creates this cycle of wanting to avoid the next day even more.

Maybe try breaking this pattern gradually? Instead of staying up until 7am, try 6am for a few days, then 5am, and so on. Also, write down what specifically makes you anxious about the next day. Sometimes just identifying those worries can make them feel more manageable.

You're not alone in this - anxiety about the next day is really common. But you deserve to have a healthy sleep schedule and not feel like you need to hide from tomorrow. Consider talking to a therapist if you can - they can help you develop better coping strategies for dealing with these feelings.","

Tomorrow‚Äôs another day.,3,Sariell,"Thank you for this thoughtful message - it really touched me, especially since I can relate to those anxiety rollercoasters. It's beautiful that even while dealing with your own struggles, you're putting positivity out there for others.

Starting your day with meditation is such a powerful choice. Those small anchoring practices can make a huge difference when anxiety tries to take the wheel. Something that's helped me is remembering that both the highs and lows are temporary - like waves, they'll eventually pass.

Your reminder about being loved and cared for is so important. Sometimes when we're in those low moments, we forget how many people's lives we touch, even in small ways. Like how your post just made my day a bit brighter.

Keep taking care of yourself, one day at a time. The fact that you're actively working on managing your anxiety while still spreading kindness shows incredible strength. Sending you good vibes and hoping you have moments of peace today too. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to take a moment to thank everyone who has taken the time to share such love in this thread. Thank you so much.

It's exactly what I needed to read today, and I'm sure many others feel the same way. Sometimes we get so caught up in our own struggles that we forget we're all in this together, fighting similar battles.

Your words about crying really hit home. I used to feel ashamed of my emotions, but you're right - being able to feel deeply and show empathy is a gift, not a weakness. This world needs more people who aren't afraid to care.

I especially appreciate the reminder about accepting love. It's funny how we can be our own worst critics, pushing away the very support we need. Your message is a beautiful reminder that we're all worthy of love and connection, even (and especially) when we don't feel like we are.

Keep spreading this kind of light. Posts like yours make Reddit feel less like just another social media platform and more like a genuine community where people look out for each other. We all need these reminders sometimes. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

913bv5,Anxiety,I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?,misery-boy,"I'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because I'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. Am I just spineless or is this something that others feel?",1224,94,1532313238,"It‚Äôs totally normal! I had a lot of issues with confrontation when I was a little younger and still do to some extent, and going back over how arguments could have gone was pretty common for me then. I still do now, as do a lot of people I think- even if you don‚Äôt avoid a confrontation it‚Äôs pretty common to remember things later you wish you‚Äôd remembered to say at the time that would‚Äôve made a killer argument.
Going over it in your head can be therapeutic to an extent, but thinking about explaining your position and actually doing it are as different as thinking about your favourite food and eating it; both are good feelings but only one will actually help you out. So my advice would be not to worry about it or be ashamed of it- what you‚Äôre doing is perfectly normal, but at the same time if you want to really put your views out there then don‚Äôt be satisfied with your current habits because they won‚Äôt get you where you want to be.

*platonic hugs* Hope your day went well!",30,Foxienerd,"You're definitely not alone or weird in this! What you're describing is actually really common for people with anxiety, especially social anxiety. I do the same thing - replaying conversations in my head where I finally say what I want to say without fear of judgment or losing relationships.

It's not being spineless at all - it's your brain trying to protect you from perceived threats. The fear of losing friendships over disagreements is a heavy burden to carry, and it makes total sense that you'd rather keep the peace than risk conflict.

Have you considered starting small? Maybe practice expressing minor disagreements with people you really trust, just to see that having different opinions doesn't automatically mean losing relationships. Most healthy friendships can actually handle and even grow stronger through respectful disagreement.

Remember that your feelings and opinions matter just as much as everyone else's. While it's kind to consider others' feelings, constantly suppressing your own isn't healthy in the long run. You're not weird - you're just working through anxiety, and that's completely valid.","

I love that you went to the park and treated yourself to ice cream. Getting outside, even briefly, can be such a game-changer for mental health. And you're absolutely right - doing dishes and basic self-care IS productive! We need to normalize that taking care of ourselves and doing small tasks counts as achievement, especially on harder days.

Keep being gentle with yourself. There's no rule that says productivity has to happen between 9-5. What matters is that you're finding ways to take care of yourself and move forward at your own pace. üíú","

Anxiety is such an exhausting battle - it's like having an overprotective but completely irrational alarm system in your brain that won't shut off.

While we can't always make anxiety disappear completely, please know you're not alone in this struggle. Millions of us are fighting similar battles every day. What's helped me is remembering that anxiety is a liar - it makes everything feel more threatening and overwhelming than it actually is.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can teach you some really effective coping strategies. Even small things like deep breathing exercises, regular exercise, or writing down anxious thoughts can make a difference. And on the really rough days, sometimes just acknowledging ""this feeling sucks, but it will pass"" can help a bit.

It's like a frustrating anxiety catch-22. The moment you become aware of feeling peaceful, your brain goes ""Wait a minute... I'm not worrying about anything... that's suspicious!"" and then boom - anxiety kicks in.

This is actually a pretty common experience for people with anxiety. It happens because we get so used to being in an anxious state that feeling calm almost seems foreign or wrong. Sometimes we even subconsciously believe that worrying keeps us safe or prepared.

What's helped me is reminding myself that it's okay and normal to feel good. Try to observe that peaceful feeling without judging it or analyzing it too much. Think of it like watching clouds pass by - you can notice them without needing to do anything about them.

Also, when you catch yourself falling into this pattern, try saying something like ""I deserve to feel peaceful"" or ""It's safe to feel calm."" It might feel weird at first, but it helps retrain your brain to accept those positive moments.

Here's something that helped me: Most people are actually way too focused on their own lives and insecurities to be judging us as harshly as we think. That feeling of being ""annoying"" is often more about our own anxiety than reality.

Have you considered talking to a close friend you trust about this? Sometimes getting an honest outside perspective can help break that cycle of negative thoughts. And if there are specific situations where you feel this way more strongly, it might help to examine those moments - not to beat yourself up, but to better understand what's triggering these feelings.

Remember that wanting connection and trying to share love with others isn't annoying - it's deeply human. You're not wrong for wanting that, even if anxiety is making you question yourself.","

jpw9vs,Anxiety,UPDATE: At 24 I went and took my permit test. I passed!,HeyYouShouldSmile,I got every question right and now I can officially practice driving,1238,77,1604776471,"I'm 24 and still haven't gotten mine yet, so congrats! I know what you're going through.",58,triggafish,Congrats!,31,a_million_days,"Congratulations! That's awesome that you not only passed but got a perfect score! üéâ 

Don't let anyone make you feel bad about starting at 24 - everyone's journey is different, and what matters is that you're taking this step now. I got my license later too, and honestly, being a more mature learner can make you a more cautious and responsible driver.

Quick tip for practice driving: Start in empty parking lots on weekends before moving to quiet residential streets. It really helps build confidence without the pressure of traffic. Also, try to practice at different times of day - driving feels pretty different at night or in rain.

The hardest part (getting started) is behind you now. Keep at it, stay patient with yourself, and you'll be ready for your road test before you know it. You've got this! üí™","

9hv1q9,Anxiety,"I am incredibly lonely all the time, but I feel so relieved when I don‚Äôt have to be around ppl. Anybody else experience something similar?",futurefiction2,"Edit:I‚Äôm not sure if anyone will see this edit, but thank you all for commenting on this post. Reading all your comments has been comforting, but also heartbreaking knowing there are so many of us that struggle with something that seems so simple(being around other humans) I went to bed last night feeling very defeated as I gave into my anxiety yet again and bailed on a social event to stay home and be alone. However, I woke up this morning to see all these responses and they honestly made me emotional because now I see so many people struggling with this same thing! There is probably ppl even in my own apartment building that feel this way and I can‚Äôt reach them! I can‚Äôt find them because of my anxiety holding me back. This viscous cycle has to be broken.... We are weakest alone. We need each other. We can not accept isolation. ",1223,92,1537571877,"Yes. This is actually pretty common. 

If you‚Äôre like me, being around others can make you nervous, unless they‚Äôre very close to you. It takes a lot of energy to keep up acceptable social interaction.

If you‚Äôre comfortable talking about your anxiety, it can be surprisingly helpful to tell people you trust about this. It lessens the chance of hurt feelings, and it can be incredibly reassuring to have a friend look after your well-being. 

There are a few people these days that will ask where my energy is at before going out, and will offer to leave with me if I need to. That assurance alone is often enough to make me feel more relaxed.

You‚Äôre not broken. Your energy just has different parameters. Being social is draining.

It helps to practice. Eventually, you‚Äôll find a method hat works for you. Just don‚Äôt give up.",284,TheFunbag,"I, too, experience this and it‚Äôs so conflicting! I despise interacting with people I don‚Äôt have to, but I‚Äôm also always feeling lonely :(  ",62,Itsnotmeitsanon,"I totally get this - it's like being caught between two opposing forces. You crave connection but social interactions can be so draining that being alone feels like a relief. I experience this too and it's a really frustrating cycle.

Something that's helped me is starting really small with social interaction. Maybe a 30-minute coffee meetup instead of a whole evening event, or joining an activity-focused group where the social pressure is lower because everyone's focused on doing something together. This way you can build up your ""social stamina"" gradually without getting overwhelmed.

Your edit really resonates with me - there are so many of us dealing with this same struggle! Have you considered looking for local anxiety support groups? They can be a great way to meet people who truly understand what you're going through, and everyone there is working on similar challenges.

You're absolutely right that isolation isn't the answer, even though it feels safer in the moment. Be gentle with yourself as you work through this. Progress isn't linear, and every small step counts. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

What that woman did was incredibly cruel and says everything about her character and absolutely nothing about you. No decent person spends 15 minutes publicly mocking a stranger - that's straight up bullying behavior and she should be ashamed of herself.

Please don't let one miserable person rob you of your favorite restaurant or make you feel small. Your anxiety is lying to you - most people are caught up in their own worlds and aren't judging how you stand or text or speak. This woman was the exception, not the rule.

Next time something like this happens (though I hope it never does), remember you have every right to stand up for yourself or ask for help. You could tell them directly to stop harassing you, or ask the restaurant staff/other customers for support. No one deserves to be treated that way.

Your worth isn't determined by the cruel words of a stranger. Take small steps to rebuild your confidence, but don't let her win by hiding away. You deserve to exist in public spaces just as much as anyone else.","

iicu6b,Anxiety,Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry?,lezedi,"I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven‚Äôt heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here. Is this an anxiety disorder thing? Do other people experience this? Or am I just weird? :/

Many people who grew up in environments with angry or unpredictable people develop these exact reactions as a survival mechanism. Your body learned to be on high alert for signs of danger, and now it goes into ""protect mode"" even in situations that aren't actually threatening.

I experience something very similar, and while it can be connected to social anxiety, it's also a common symptom of PTSD or C-PTSD. The physical reactions you describe - shaking, freezing up, wanting to hide - are classic fight/flight/freeze responses.

If you're able to, speaking with a trauma-informed therapist could be really helpful. They can help you develop tools to ground yourself when these reactions happen and work through the underlying causes. In the meantime, know that your body is just trying to keep you safe, even if it's overreacting. You're not weird or broken - you're having a very normal response to what was likely a difficult situation in your past.","

I dealt with it for years and it's awful how those thoughts just flood in before you even fully wake up. It's like your brain goes from 0 to 100 while you're still trying to open your eyes.

What helped me was creating a strict morning routine that engages my body and mind right away. The moment I wake up, I do some deep breathing (4-7-8 method), then immediately get up and start moving - no lying there letting thoughts spiral. I'll do light stretching, make my bed, or step outside for fresh air. Having a podcast or music ready to play helps too.

The key is breaking that cycle of letting your mind race while you're still in that vulnerable half-awake state. Your brain is more susceptible to anxiety then because your stress hormones are naturally elevated in the morning.

Remember that morning anxiety often feels worse than it actually is. Those problems usually feel more manageable once you're up and moving. Hang in there - with some adjustments to your morning routine, it can get better.","

The gut-brain connection is really strong, and anxiety can absolutely trigger digestive issues like diarrhea and stomach pain. I deal with this too, and it can become a frustrating cycle where the stomach issues make you more anxious, which then makes the stomach issues worse.

Some things that have helped me:
- Deep breathing exercises when I feel the anxiety starting
- Peppermint tea for stomach discomfort
- Following a ""safe foods"" routine during high anxiety times
- Working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety/phobias

Have you considered talking to a healthcare provider about this? They might be able to help with both the emetophobia and the physical symptoms. There are treatments available that can make this more manageable.

Just know you're not alone in this. Anxiety-induced digestive issues are way more common than most people realize, even if it's not talked about much. Hang in there! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

n6kr5j,Anxiety,My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,pain_in_the-anus,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference",1219,87,1620343509,Thanks for this tip!!! I bet it takes some getting used to? I always get caught in the self doubt and rumination trap it‚Äôs so hard to get out of it. I‚Äôll remember this. ü•∞,114,bluebearymuffin_,Thanks for this tip!!! I bet it takes some getting used to? I always get caught in the self doubt and rumination trap it‚Äôs so hard to get out of it. I‚Äôll remember this. ü•∞,114,bluebearymuffin_,"This resonates with me so much. I used to get caught in those endless ""what-if"" spirals that just lead to more anxiety and zero actual solutions. Making a conscious choice to trust your initial well-thought-out decision is surprisingly powerful.

One thing that helped me implement this approach was setting a specific time limit for decision-making. Like ""I'll spend 30 minutes considering this choice, then whatever I decide is final."" It gives structure to the process and makes it harder to fall back into the overthinking trap.

Thanks for sharing this insight from your therapy. It's a great reminder that sometimes the simplest tools can be the most effective. And you're absolutely right about control - we can't control outcomes, but we can control our response to situations and trust ourselves to handle whatever comes next.

Really glad this technique is helping with your GAD and panic attacks. It's encouraging to hear success stories like this!","

POST TITLE: My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life

POST BODY: It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference

iyirtz,Anxiety,I TALKED IN MY ONLINE CLASS TODAY,kr3pie,"I was in my AP Psychology class today (Wednesday‚Äôs are online days so the school can clean) and my teacher said she wouldn‚Äôt be checking the chat because it gets too confusing. She started playing a video with a horrible echo and kids tried telling her in the chat, and I wanted to work up the courage to turn my mic on to tell her. I was shaking so bad, so I took a sip of water and quickly pressed the button thinking ‚ÄúOK I TURNED IT ON ITS NOW OR NEVER‚Äù and I told her and answered her questions and it GOT FIXED!! She even thanked me at the end of class for being the one to speak up. I‚ÄôM SO HAPPY!!!",1268,38,1600894086,"That's awesome!

Speaking up in online classes can sometimes be even more nerve-wracking than in-person classes, so that's amazing that you spoke up and don't regret it.",156,shark-cowboy1711,[deleted],2,[deleted],"That's awesome, way to push through the anxiety and speak up! It's such a great feeling when you face your fears and it works out positively. Not only did you help your teacher fix an annoying technical issue that was affecting everyone's learning experience, but you also proved to yourself that you CAN speak up in class, even if it feels scary at first.

Try to remember this win the next time you're feeling nervous about participating. Each small victory like this helps build confidence for future situations. Plus, your teacher clearly appreciated your initiative - that kind of positive reinforcement can make the next time feel a bit easier.

Speaking as someone who used to get super anxious about talking in class, I promise it gets better with practice. You did great today, be proud of yourself! üéâ","

gg45u4,Anxiety,Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,AromaticPigeon,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)",1110,196,1588980321,I do this when I go to sleep cause I start thinking too much before bed. I always do a live stream cause the thought of being unconscious for hours is a weird one for me so I like to know things are still going on while I sleep idk lmao,179,justdrapin,,0,,"I totally get this! I do the exact same thing and have for years. Having familiar shows playing in the background is like having comfortable friends around - it creates this gentle bubble of background noise that helps keep anxiety at bay.

For me, The Office and Parks & Rec are my go-to shows because I know them so well that I don't need to actively watch, but the familiar voices and humor are soothing. I don't think there's anything wrong with this coping mechanism as long as it's not interfering with your daily life or sleep.

If you're worried about constant stimulation, maybe try gradually introducing some quiet periods during low-anxiety parts of your day. But honestly, if this helps you function better, that's what matters. Lots of people use background noise to feel more comfortable - it's a pretty common anxiety management technique.

Love your choices of Friends and B99, by the way! Both have that perfect mix of humor and comfort that makes great background shows.","

Those little interactions like ordering coffee and asking about prices might seem small to some people, but I totally understand how nerve-wracking they can be when you're not used to doing them.

A tip that helped me when I started going out alone: remember that most service workers deal with hundreds of customers every day, and they're not judging you nearly as much as your anxiety might suggest. They've seen it all, trust me!

Keep building on this success - maybe next time you could try having lunch alone or checking out a bookstore? The more you do it, the more natural it feels. But for now, just bask in your accomplishment. You pushed yourself out of your comfort zone today and absolutely crushed it! üí™","

I totally get where you're coming from with the social media anxiety - that urge to delete posts right away is something a lot of us struggle with. It's actually really brave that you're pushing yourself to try again after deleting your last post.

Think of this as exposure therapy - each time you leave a post up a little longer, you're building confidence and showing yourself that sharing online isn't as scary as it feels. The fact that you're still here and even added a positive edit shows progress!

Remember that most people are way too focused on their own posts to judge yours harshly. And if someone does leave a negative comment? That says more about them than you.

Keep taking these small steps. Maybe next time set a goal for 30 minutes, then an hour. There's no rush - go at whatever pace feels manageable. You've got this, and it's clear from your edit that the community is here to support you! üôÇ","

I got a perfect score!! And an A in the class!!

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how paralyzing it can be, especially during exams. The fact that you pushed through despite having a full-blown anxiety attack during the final shows incredible strength and resilience.

Coming back to college after such a traumatic experience with Xanax couldn't have been easy. The fact that you not only came back but absolutely crushed it with a perfect score is remarkable. You're living proof that anxiety doesn't define our capabilities.

I hope you're taking time to celebrate this win - you absolutely deserve it. Have you considered working with your school's disability services? They can sometimes provide accommodations for anxiety that make testing less stressful, like private rooms or extended time. Might be worth looking into for future classes.

Keep taking care of yourself, and be proud of how far you've come. This internet stranger is definitely proud of you! üéâ","

I can‚Äôt even go out literally. I just want to stay in my house. Sit in my room. Cook food. Maybe go outside IF it‚Äôs sunny.

Edit: also, does anyone eat their anxiety?? Is that a thing?

Edit #2: do you guys in the replies think maybe you‚Äôre being is sensitive than others? I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I‚Äôm grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people‚Äôs energy. So my social anxiety is the one I struggle with most. I can feel. Every. Fucking. Thing. No joke. I can feel if someone looks at me, and throws a judgement my way. It‚Äôs like every time that I go out I have to put this huge mental shield around my body and focus on staying grounded, or it‚Äôs really challenging, so many things to feel, to process.",1134,168,1618219067,"Are you me?

Yeah, this is the worst I've been in a long time. I want to puke and cry every morning and then when I try to analyse my life, I come to the conclusion that my life really isn't that bad and somehow that just makes it worse!

I hate this. I'm genuinely terrified that this will be me forever and I don't know how much more I can take.",205,Irishane,"Yes! Eating to passify my anxiety has been a major feature for me. I think that's quite a common thing and I'd bet loads of people who do it don't connect it to anxiety.   
But thankfully I've been kicking anxietys ass lately.   
CBD oil works for me to reduce my anxiety levels, or maybe that's wrong, it's more like ""muffle"" it, the anxiety is still there but I can't feel most of it. Then I started thinking that my gut bacteria had something to do with my anxiety, so I started drinking probiotic yoghurt which seemed to help a little.  Then one day I was listening to the Blindboy Podcast and he was talking about kambucha as a source of good bacteria, O. M. G. I tried it, and what a difference! Unlike the CBD, I feel the kambucha is actually helping reduce my anxiety, rather than just dulling it. I've only drank it 3 times in the past week, but I've seen a really big difference, I've halved the amount of CBD oil I've been taking and I'm able to exercise more. I'm quietly confident.     
So, given food calms your anxiety, try working to fix your gut bacteria and see if that helps.      
   
Edit: i also stopped drinking alcohol completely which was a great help, and I'm limited to 1 coffee a day.",2,bot_bot_bot,"I totally feel you on this. The anxiety has been intense lately for so many people - you're definitely not alone. And yes, anxiety eating is absolutely a thing! It's a common coping mechanism when our nervous system is overwhelmed.

As a fellow sensitive person, I completely understand what you mean about feeling everything so intensely. That constant awareness of others' energy can be exhausting, especially in public spaces. It's like having your emotional antenna turned up to maximum all the time.

Some things that have helped me:
- Grounding exercises (literally touching the earth when possible)
- Setting boundaries about how much time I spend around others
- Regular meditation to help ""clear"" absorbed energies
- Carrying a grounding crystal or comfort object when I have to go out

It's okay to honor your need for quiet time and solitude while you're feeling this way. Your body is telling you what it needs. Just make sure to reach out to your support system (even virtually) so you don't get too isolated.

Sending you peaceful vibes. This intense period will pass. üíú","

I've been in those anxiety spirals where your brain keeps serving up increasingly catastrophic ""what-ifs,"" and it's so hard to see clearly in those moments.

Something that helps me is remembering that anxiety is like an overprotective but completely irrational friend - it means well by trying to prepare us for dangers, but it's terrible at assessing actual risk. When I catch myself spiraling, I try to pause and ask ""Is this anxiety talking, or is this reality?""

I especially appreciate your point about accepting that worst-case scenarios *could* happen. Paradoxically, acknowledging this possibility often takes away some of its power. Instead of fighting the thoughts, we can say ""Yeah, that could happen... but it probably won't, and I'll deal with it if it does.""

Here's what helped me break out of a similar rut: Start incredibly small. Like, laughably small. Don't think about the ""best"" use of your time - just pick ONE tiny thing to do each day. Maybe it's taking a 10-minute walk, applying to one job, or spending 15 minutes learning something new online.

The goal isn't to transform your life overnight. It's to prove to yourself that you can take action, even if it's small. Those small wins build momentum and help quiet that anxious voice telling you you're not doing enough.

You're not garbage - you're someone stuck in an anxiety loop that a lot of us have experienced. Be gentle with yourself while you work on making changes. If you haven't already, consider talking to a therapist about this. They can help give you tools to manage these thoughts.","

ok19yt,Anxiety,How generalised anxiety disorder works,lagatixa,"So here is how my anxiety disorder looks like: your mum sends you a photo of the dog walking, with no caption. The leash looks like it broke on the photo so you call her. She doesn‚Äôt answer. You automatically go into a panic thinking the dog run away and got hit by a car and now your mum is panicking and that is why she doesn‚Äôt answer her phone so you keep calling and calling and crying and struggling to breathe until she eventually answers, and it was just the sun reflecting on the photo and the leash is fine and your dog is fine and everyone is fine, but you are now drained and just want to go hide under the covers and recuperate.",1165,132,1626257271,Yup... That's the gist. Had a complete meltdown Sunday after coming home from my parents and not being able to find my cat who has never run outside before and is scared of everything and would never try to run away... I just knew he was out on the streets lost and I was hysterical. He was just hiding in a different closet than usual. üòë My brain goes from 0-100 in a blink of an eye...,169,bellitabee,"&gt;The fact that it is always on in the background drives me nuts.

This.....  this explains my main frustration with GAD perfectly...  it's just always there..... ""Oh hey I know you're trying to meet some work deadlines, but just a reminder that I'm (GAD) still here!""........    It gets so frustrating sometimes....",54,asyrewicze,"I totally get this. It's like your brain immediately jumps to the worst possible scenario and creates this whole devastating story within seconds. And the physical symptoms - the racing heart, trouble breathing, that feeling of impending doom - they're so real and draining, even when it turns out everything is fine.

Something that's helped me with similar situations is the ""evidence method."" When those panic thoughts start, I try to pause and list out the more likely explanations: Mom might be driving, she could be in the bathroom, maybe she's getting coffee, etc. It doesn't always stop the anxiety completely, but it can help slow down that spiral of worst-case scenarios.

The exhaustion afterwards is so real too. Please don't feel bad about needing to recover under those covers - that's a completely normal response to the stress your body and mind just went through.

You described GAD so perfectly here. For anyone reading who experiences similar things, you're not alone and you're not ""crazy"" for reacting this way. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

bpfjb8,Anxiety,anyone else find they need near constant background noise to help stop anxious/depressed inner thoughts?,TheCakeDrake,"I realised I always have background noise, audiobooks, music, netflix, something on. I especially need this in times of quiet or before bed when my anxious and obsessive thoughts start to eat away at me. I can't seem to be alone with my inner thoughts, I'm not sure if it's healthy or not but the white noise seems to stem the flow and ease my mind",1130,165,1558028304,Yup. It's why I fall asleep to TV and am always listening to something,182,Kiwishea,"Same, I got into podcasts and it's been helping me focus on something other than my own thoughts.",12,SarahPineTree,"I totally get this - I do the exact same thing. It's like having background noise creates a buffer between you and those intrusive thoughts that love to creep in during quiet moments.

While it's a common coping mechanism (you're definitely not alone!), it might be worth gradually experimenting with short periods of quiet. Maybe start with just 5 minutes of mindful breathing or meditation when you're feeling okay, and slowly build up your tolerance. Think of it like training a muscle - you don't have to dive into complete silence all at once.

That said, if background noise helps you function and get through your day, don't beat yourself up about it. There's nothing inherently wrong with using audio as a tool to manage anxiety. You might want to try nature sounds or white noise apps instead of TV sometimes - they can be less stimulating while still providing that comfortable audio cushion.

Just remember that if your anxiety is significantly impacting your daily life, it's always okay to reach out to a mental health professional for additional support and strategies.","

The isolation and confinement of quarantine has been a perfect storm for anxiety, especially for those of us who already deal with anxiety disorders. That feeling of being ""trapped"" both physically and mentally is so real.

Have you been able to talk to your mental health provider about these new symptoms? If your anxiety was previously under control, they might be able to help adjust your treatment plan for these unusual circumstances.

In the meantime, try to create some distinction between your ""inside"" and ""outside"" spaces, even within your home. Set up a specific area for relaxation, take short walks if possible (even just around your yard), or sit by an open window. Deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation can help with that racing heart feeling too.

Remember that increased anxiety during this time is a normal response to an abnormal situation. Your body and mind are trying to protect you, even if it feels overwhelming right now. You got your anxiety under control before, and you can do it again - even if it takes time and help.","

I deal with the same thing, especially the nausea and shaky feeling. It's awful and frustrating when your body reacts this way.

Some things that help me in the moment:
- Deep belly breathing (4 counts in, hold for 4, out for 4)
- Sipping ice cold water slowly
- Gentle movement like walking or stretching
- The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, etc.)

The physical symptoms usually pass within 20-30 minutes, even though it feels like forever when you're in it. If this is happening regularly, talking to your doctor or a therapist could give you more tools to manage it. They can help figure out if medication might be helpful too.

Just remember you're not alone in this and what you're experiencing is real. Anxiety can absolutely make you physically ill, but there are ways to get through it. Hang in there! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I used to do the same thing, talking non-stop in social situations because silence felt uncomfortable and made my anxious thoughts louder. And that feeling of needing constant connection through texts? Been there too.

Here's what helped me: First, recognizing that it's okay to have quiet moments, both in conversations and in life. Not every space needs to be filled. Second, finding other ways to occupy your mind when alone - maybe a hobby that requires focus, like reading, drawing, or even meditation. These can help quiet those anxious thoughts without depending on others' responses.

Remember that people's response times usually have nothing to do with you personally. Everyone's got their own stuff going on, and slow responses rarely mean what our anxiety tells us they mean.

You're not alone in this experience - it's actually a pretty common way that anxiety shows up. Have you considered talking to a therapist about these feelings? They can help develop strategies specific to your situation.","

mi1zi3,Anxiety,"Does anyone else occasionally have ""Time anxiety""?",DarkCelestial,"Time anxiety as in having anxiety that you won't ever have enough time to do something specific. In my case, I always get anxious when my wife has me run to the store or go to an appointment mainly because I fear I won't have enough time to do things that I wanna do even going as far as to get annoyed in my head when I'm told to let the dog out after work...

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to have plenty of free time once I'm off from work, about 6 hours till I go to sleep so 5-6 hours of me doing what I want but when something simple like letting the dog out, shaving, cleaning a bathroom comes up I get anxiety thinking oh crap I'm, not gonna have enough time to do what I wanna do....how can you get past this? It's obviously silly to me because doing all that takes very little time and when i do have free time I spend it watching tv and hardly doing anything productive...

Here's what helped me: Instead of viewing these tasks as time-stealers, try reframing them as part of your life's flow. Taking the dog out can be a mini-break to stretch your legs. Cleaning can be paired with listening to an audiobook or podcast you enjoy.

The irony is that anxiety about not having enough time often leads us to ""protect"" our free time by doing nothing - exactly what you described with TV watching. Maybe start small: commit to using just 30 minutes of your evening for something you actually want to do, like the gym or reading. You'll likely find that you still have plenty of time left, and accomplishing something meaningful actually gives you more energy rather than depleting it.

Remember, life isn't divided into ""tasks"" and ""free time"" - it's all your time, and you get to decide how to make it meaningful.","

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you unpack those childhood experiences and develop better ways to manage the anxiety. Also, setting boundaries with your mom about what you share is totally valid and healthy - you're protecting yourself from unnecessary stress.

It's completely understandable that you're worried about following a similar path.

Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you coping techniques specifically for nighttime anxiety and help break that cycle of anticipatory stress. Even small things like having a consistent bedtime routine, doing some light stretching, or writing down your worries before bed can help signal to your brain that it's time to rest.

I also want to gently suggest talking to your doctor about this. While medication isn't the only answer, there are options far milder than Xanax that could help you get your sleep back on track while you work on the underlying anxiety.

You're already doing the right thing by reaching out and being proactive about this. Anxiety doesn't have to control your life the way it did your father's. There's help available, and you deserve to feel comfortable and at peace again. Sending you strength üíú","

ogud85,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they‚Äôre too difficult to love?,Kaitcatkitten,"Between the constant panic and worrying, the irritability, the non stop second guessing. The sometimes not being able to do normal every day things alone like shopping and driving. I feel like I‚Äôll never have a solid relationship where someone understands me. I feel undeserving of love. There‚Äôs no way I could ever maintain a healthy relationship and the reality of this sucks.",1172,114,1625833086,"I feel similar. 

I do not feel undeserving of love, yet I am clear with myself that it ain‚Äôt easy to be with me. I‚Äòm not jealous, not needy etc, but like you said, I have anxiety when it comes to shopping, or going to get together and my bf has to go alone often because I prioritiese my mental health over being at these events. 

What I feel is that whenever I met someone in the past and the first love cloud blinds them, they say how they don‚Äôt mind, how it‚Äòs not a Problem and they will never be annoyed by my anxiety and need to unwind alone more often than others - though I know better and tell them so (maybe I shouldn‚Äôt). And, surprise, after 6 to 9 months it starts to be a problem, maybe not one that gets said out loud a lot, but you feel if someone thinks ‚ÄûWhy can‚Äòt she be easy going, extroverted and social a bit more?‚Äú 

It feels like partners start to try to change my after the first glow of being in love is over, and to me that means it isn‚Äôt love - the kind that you feel for someone unconditionally, take them as they are, as the person you met. 

I really hope you find your person, the ones who isn‚Äôt only in love or has a crush on you, but who will love you more each day exactly how you are and support you.",102,Water_Melonia,"Everyone is difficult to love. Love is difficult. But true love is unconditional. People who care for you in all the right ways will find it easy to love you! You might tell yourself otherwise, and perhaps that‚Äôs a conditional love you have for yourself?",75,[deleted],"I hear you completely, and please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Having anxiety can make us feel like we're ""too much"" or ""too difficult"" - I've been there too. But here's the thing: everyone has their own complexities and challenges. The right person won't see your anxiety as a burden; they'll want to understand and support you through it.

Try to remember that being deserving of love isn't about being ""perfect"" or ""easy."" It's about being human, and you're just as deserving as anyone else. Many people with anxiety have wonderful, understanding relationships. Your self-awareness actually shows emotional intelligence, which is a strength in relationships.

Start by being gentle with yourself. Maybe work with a therapist if you aren't already - they can help you develop coping strategies and build self-acceptance. Focus on small victories, like the days you do manage to go shopping or drive, rather than the days you can't.

You're not broken or unloveable. You're someone dealing with anxiety, and that's okay. The right person will see all of you, challenges and all, and choose to love you anyway.","

hik9ew,Anxiety,Anybody else hate speaking on the phone?,JLR105,"I have absolutely no problem speaking to whoever in person. Just no problem. But picking up the phone and make a call... God, it drives me anxious to oblivion. I don't know why, but it's one of the most uncomfortable things for me.",1150,136,1593510454,"I **never** want to talk to **anyone** on the phone, to the point where I will have my spouse order pizza or answer unknown numbers on my phone if I‚Äôm waiting for a call.

But, I work in a call center because I needed a job desperately at the time. The stress I feel on a daily basis is unbearable. All I get to warn me that a call is coming through is a beep on the phone. Then I have to keep a calm customer service voice whether or not I‚Äôm being yelled at, talked over, or being blamed for a bad connection.

It‚Äôs a living nightmare for me. One my superiors even tried to guilt me into staying by telling me I wouldn‚Äôt function in another job because of my anxiety. It‚Äôs made me decide to leave the job because they‚Äôve overstepped their bounds into bullying to keep me around (I have nearly perfect performance scores because I worry about doing badly).",165,[deleted],[deleted],23,[deleted],"I totally get this! Phone anxiety is super common, even for people who are completely comfortable with face-to-face conversations. I think it's because when we're on the phone, we lose all the visual cues and body language that help us navigate social interactions.

What's helped me is:
- Writing down key points before making calls
- Reminding myself that the person on the other end probably makes/takes dozens of calls daily and won't remember our interaction
- Starting with easier calls (like ordering takeout) and working up to more challenging ones
- Setting specific times for making calls so I don't procrastinate

Also, remember that in this digital age, many people prefer texting/email anyway, so you're definitely not alone in finding calls uncomfortable. Don't be too hard on yourself about it - it's a totally valid feeling and something lots of people struggle with.

Have you found any particular strategies that help make calls a bit easier for you?","

nqqr5j,Anxiety,I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,throwfaraway1912,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a ""let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe"" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return. You are all amazing people and you are all FIGHTERS - not failures. You have helped me see that I am not a failure either, and I wish I could give each and every one of you a hug. I wish all of you the happiness and health that life has to offer. Thank you x a million. ",1103,180,1622653642,"That is a huge success--putting yourself first.

I am in the same boat right now, unemployed and living at my parents house. Some days I get really down on myself but other days I'm like FUCK YEAH I'm not having panic attacks every day after work and wanting to die because of my physical symptoms. I am so proud of you for making that decision because I know it wasn't easy. Hang in there bud!!!",224,No-Thanks-470,"Try not to think about others now! Your health is the most important thing now.

You're making the brave and necessary choice to prioritize your health, and that takes real courage. Teaching is one of the most demanding professions out there, and the burnout is real - I've seen many wonderful teachers have to step away for similar reasons.

Please know that choosing to leave doesn't erase the positive impact you've had on your students over these past 6 years. You've likely touched more lives than you realize. Your supervisor may be disappointed, but any good leader will understand that you need to take care of yourself first.

While it feels scary now, this isn't the end - it's a new beginning. Take some time to heal and recover. Your experience as a teacher has given you valuable skills that will transfer to many other careers: communication, organization, leadership, adaptability. Those skills won't go to waste.

You're not crazy or weak. You're human, and you're making a tough but wise decision. Wishing you all the best as you start this new chapter.","

Congratulations :) You deserve to feel proud,51,miasboring,"Congratulations! This is a huge win and you should be really proud of yourself! üéâ 

The racing heart is totally normal when getting back into the workforce, especially after a long break. Your body is just adjusting to the new routine and heightened activity level. Think of it like getting back into exercise - it takes time for your system to recalibrate.

One thing that helped me with work anxiety was reminding myself that everyone was new at some point, and that feeling nervous means you care about doing well. Try taking some slow, deep breaths throughout the day when you notice your heart racing - it really helps calm the nervous system.

Each day will get a little easier as you build confidence and familiarity with your role. You've already proven to yourself that you can handle it, even with the anxiety! Keep going, you're doing great! üí™","

mt9xax,Anxiety,Does anyone else just convince themselves they need to stop talking,Strong-Land2285,"Sometimes at night I‚Äôll go over the things I said during the day and just cringe at myself and think everyone was so annoyed with me and then I convince myself that I need to stop talking and be a neutral person with no personality.

That late-night replay of every conversation, analyzing each word choice and wondering if you came across as ""too much"" - I think a lot of us go through this, especially those of us who tend to be more self-aware.

But here's the thing: people generally aren't scrutinizing our words nearly as much as we think they are. Most folks are wrapped up in their own thoughts and concerns. And the people who genuinely care about you probably appreciate your personality and authenticity, even if you sometimes say things that make you cringe later.

Try to remember that having a personality and expressing yourself isn't a bad thing. Being ""neutral"" sounds safe, but it would mean losing what makes you uniquely you. Everyone has moments they wish they could take back - it's part of being human.

Next time those thoughts creep in, try to be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend. Would you tell a friend they should stop talking and hide their personality? Probably not!","

jwawkx,Anxiety,Anyone else anxious about having to go back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô eventually?,vincethesweatshirt,"I feel so selfish for this because I‚Äôve been lucky enough to be able to WFH and quarantine this entire time.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm using COVID as an excuse to socially isolate myself or if I‚Äôm genuinely still terrified of catching it/passing it, but I really love my new routine. 

I get to work on my own time without the awkward office chatter, don‚Äôt have to spend all day on campus being overly self-aware, I don‚Äôt feel obligated to attend social events, it‚Äôs honestly amazing.

A lot of people have discovered that the slower pace and flexibility of WFH actually helps manage their anxiety better. There's nothing selfish about acknowledging what works for your mental health, even if it came from an otherwise difficult situation.

Maybe instead of viewing this as having to go ""back to normal,"" you could think about how to carry forward the positive changes you've discovered. Could you talk to your employer about a hybrid work schedule? Or schedule your classes to allow for more breaks and downtime? The world is rethinking work/life balance right now, so it's actually a good time to advocate for what you need.

Don't feel guilty about finding silver linings - your improved mental health doesn't diminish anyone else's struggles. Focus on identifying which specific aspects of your current routine help you thrive (like the flexible schedule and reduced social pressure) and brainstorm ways to maintain those elements even as things transition. You've learned valuable things about what works for you, and that's worth holding onto.","

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn‚Äôt like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I‚Äôm a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep.

It's like creating a buffer zone between the peace of sleep and whatever stressful thing is coming up. Those quiet hours feel like borrowed time where you can just exist without having to face anything yet.

While it's a common anxiety response, constantly losing sleep over it isn't great for your mental or physical health in the long run. Have you considered using that early morning time more intentionally? Instead of lying there with racing thoughts, you could try some gentle meditation, journaling, or even just listening to calming music. That way you still get your buffer time, but it becomes more restorative than draining.

Props to you for starting to recognize and talk about your anxiety patterns. That's a huge step. If you haven't already, it might be worth talking to your school's counseling services - they often have great resources for managing academic anxiety specifically.

You're definitely not alone in this - it's actually really common among people with anxiety. Hope you can find some ways to make those early mornings work better for you!","

That sudden ring or vibration can trigger an instant fight-or-flight response - your heart races and you get that pit in your stomach. For me, it's because phone calls feel so urgent and demanding compared to texts, plus you can't prepare for what the person might say.

Something that helped me was customizing different ringtones/vibration patterns for my closest contacts (family, best friend, etc.). That way, when I hear it, I immediately know if it's someone ""safe"" versus an unknown number. I also turned off vibrations for most apps and kept them only for actual calls/texts from my VIP contacts.

Don't feel weird about this - there's actually a term for it (telephonophobia) and lots of people struggle with it, especially in our text-first culture. It's totally valid to prefer other forms of communication that give you more control over the interaction.

That story about calling yourself is super relatable btw - phone anxiety can be really physical!","

It's actually really common for our brains to suddenly dig up old memories and force us to re-examine them through a new lens, even years later. It can be pretty brutal when it happens.

But here's something important to remember: You're not that same person anymore. You've built a successful career and made it through college - those are huge achievements that show who you really are. Those high school bullies? They're just characters in an old story now.

What you're experiencing might be your adult self processing things your teenage self couldn't fully understand at the time. That's actually a sign of growth, even though it doesn't feel great.

If these thoughts keep bothering you, it might be worth talking to a therapist. They can help you put these memories in perspective and develop better tools for handling them when they pop up.

Remember, your worth isn't defined by how some immature high schoolers treated you a decade ago. It's defined by who you are today, and it sounds like you've become someone pretty impressive.","

This month has been brutal.,216,KittyKat980,Same. This month has been brutal.,216,KittyKat980,"Yes, October has been particularly rough for a lot of people, myself included. The combination of shorter days, pandemic fatigue, election stress, and the reality that this situation isn't ending anytime soon is hitting everyone hard. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way.

First, I want to say that scheduling therapy is such a smart, proactive move. It takes courage to recognize when you need support and actually reach out for it. That's something to be proud of.

One thing that's helped me lately is breaking each day into smaller, manageable chunks rather than getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Also, try to get outside during daylight hours when possible - the vitamin D and fresh air really do make a difference, especially as we head into winter.

Hang in there. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and it's okay to have periods where things feel harder. We're all just doing our best to get through this together. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

fxc59w,Anxiety,Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,luxuryballs,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don‚Äôt let your imagination get the best of you.",1216,59,1586371377,Wait... WHERE IS THE FIRST 25%???,232,Saberleaf,Wait... WHERE IS THE FIRST 25%???,232,Saberleaf,"This is such a helpful way to reframe social anxiety! I've struggled with constantly trying to ""decode"" what others think of me, and it's exhausting. The 25% rule really puts things in perspective - we simply can't control how everyone perceives us, and that's totally okay.

I especially appreciate the point about not trusting our anxious imagination. When I catch myself spiraling about what someone ""might"" be thinking, I try to remember that my anxiety is basically writing fiction at that point. Most people are too focused on their own lives to scrutinize our every move anyway.

One thing I'd add is that focusing on being authentic actually tends to attract the right people naturally. The 25% who will like you regardless? Those are often the folks who appreciate you for who you genuinely are.

Thanks for sharing this framework - it's a really practical way to ease that constant pressure to manage everyone's impressions of us. Letting go of that impossible task is incredibly freeing.","

kaku8r,Anxiety,I reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety.,cleverusername143,"Today after about 4 weeks of sitting on the idea I finally reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety in an attempt to get out of work while getting paid. 

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression. 

Nothing may come of my complaint but, at least I did it!

I could've started medication in June instead I spent summer most of fall just devastated. Mental health care here in the U.S. is terrible.,255,diebytheblade15,"What a butt of a doctor. It was good that you reported him. I don't understand why anyone would even come up with the thought that someone is ""faking it"" in order to get out of work. Humans naturally want to be productive, and if they don't, there is something wrong that needs to be adressed in the first place - such as anxiety for example.

I am sorry you had that experience, but I commend you for standing up for yourself instead of just taking it, that can be very difficult to do.",79,BearClawBling,"Good for you for standing up for yourself and reporting that doctor! It's absolutely unacceptable for medical professionals to dismiss mental health concerns or accuse patients of faking symptoms. Anxiety is a real medical condition that deserves proper treatment and respect.

I'm so glad you were able to find a new doctor who takes your mental health seriously. That's exactly the kind of care you deserve. The suggestion to see a therapist is also really solid advice - having both medical and therapeutic support can make a huge difference when managing anxiety and depression.

Even if nothing immediate comes from the complaint, you've helped create a record of this doctor's inappropriate behavior. This could help protect future patients who might encounter similar dismissive treatment. 

Keep advocating for yourself and working with healthcare providers who respect your experiences. Mental health care is healthcare, full stop. Wishing you the best with your upcoming appointment and treatment journey!","

lo5uv7,Anxiety,It‚Äôs honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear,baconanustart,"Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. But also couldn‚Äôt sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It‚Äôs like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out.

That feeling where your rational brain is saying ""this is fine"" but your body is like ""NOPE, DANGER, SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING!"" It's exhausting and frustrating, especially when the thing you're dreading turns out to be completely manageable.

What helped me was learning that anxiety is basically our brain's ancient survival system going haywire. It's trying to protect us, but it's really bad at distinguishing between ""first day at new job"" and ""being chased by a lion."" That's why logic often doesn't help in the moment - you're dealing with a primal response, not a rational one.

Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you techniques to help ""talk to"" your anxiety, like grounding exercises or exposure therapy. It won't make the anxiety disappear completely, but it can help make it more manageable.

Also, please know you're not stupid for feeling this way. Anxiety isn't rational, and beating yourself up about it only adds another layer of stress. You're dealing with something real and challenging, and you're still showing up - that takes serious strength.","

nxd3px,Anxiety,Does anyone else get home from work and obsess over every interaction they've had during the day?,froginasuit,"This happens to me every day I come home from work. I'll have constant flash-backs to some cringy thing I said or did and I just sit on the couch and freak out and it makes chilling after work impossible. 

It doesn't help that im super anxious around people so I'm always overanalysing myself at work and I'm constantly worried about coming across some type of way and so I don't say much (which i think probably just makes me seem rude anyway). 

Is anyone else stuck being so critical over every interaction they have? And has anyone found anything that helps them wind down after interacting with people? I'm so exhausted mentally and it makes work hell. 

Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile.",1187,85,1623408707,"Immediately after I do something deemed cringeworthy in my mind (which let‚Äôs be honest, when you have anxiety that can be a lot of things) I obsessively think about it and how people perceived it. It really is very crippling and I can‚Äôt even bare to think about the amount of hours I‚Äôve spent criticizing myself because of this. 

Try to tell yourself that you are just doing the best you can. You‚Äôre not doing anything cringeworthy. You‚Äôre just you. Take a deep breath (or as many as it takes, the kind where you feel it in the center of your chest) and try to be kind to yourself. I don‚Äôt know you but I bet you‚Äôre a great person to work with because it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre not self-centered. I wish we were coworkers because we could commiserate about this together!

I hope it gets better for you. You‚Äôre doing your best and it‚Äôs ok to take up space and exist! Try to give yourself a little break if you can.

That mental replay of every awkward moment or analyzing ""did I come across weird when I said that?"" can really eat up your evening.

Something that's helped me is reminding myself that most people are way too focused on their own lives/worries to remember our supposed ""cringe"" moments. Think about it - can you remember any awkward things your coworkers did last week? Probably not, because we're all wrapped up in our own stuff.

I've also found that having a clear ""transition"" routine after work helps break that overthinking cycle. I'll change clothes, take a short walk, or do some stretching - anything physical that signals to my brain ""work mode is done."" Sometimes I'll even say out loud ""Today's interactions are complete"" just to mentally close that chapter.

You're definitely not alone in this. Social anxiety is really common and it doesn't make you weird or broken. Be gentle with yourself - you're probably doing much better than you think you are.","

Tips on how to work on this. ,1159,111,1551328742,Stumble? When I'm really nervous the words don't even come out I just open my mouth and... Awkward. No coming back from that. That and less anxious times my voice rises and I sound like a mouse. And yes I mispronounce and even forget words. You're not alone ,163,Karayanna,,0,,"This is so relatable! I also struggle with this - it's like my tongue gets tied in knots when anxiety kicks in, especially during presentations or important conversations. It's a really common anxiety symptom and you're definitely not alone.

A few things that have helped me:
- Taking a deep breath before speaking to calm my nerves
- Speaking slightly slower than I normally would (it feels weird at first but helps a lot)
- Practicing difficult words or phrases ahead of time if I know I'll need to say them
- Reminding myself that most people are understanding and won't judge an occasional stumble

The key is to not beat yourself up when it happens. The more anxious we get about potentially stumbling, the more likely we are to actually do it. Try to be patient with yourself - this is just your body's natural response to anxiety, not a reflection of your intelligence or capabilities.

If it's significantly impacting your life, speaking with a speech therapist or anxiety counselor can provide more specialized techniques and exercises to help manage it.","

oy6u9l,Anxiety,Anyone else get the urge to just leave everything behind and go live in a log cabin in the mountains?,Tatsfomone,"Lately ive become more and more unsure what i want from my life, and everytime I feel sad, mad or deprived of energy i just wanna pack my shit and go, its mostly a coping mechanism i think, but its also way more. I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough.

The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

The fact that you're self-aware enough to recognize it as a coping mechanism shows you've got more insight than you might think.

That feeling of watching problems approach but lacking the energy to act? Classic sign of burnout, possibly depression. The good news is you haven't given up hope - your self-protective instincts around substance use prove that part of you is still looking toward the future.

Instead of trying to figure out your entire life purpose right now, maybe start smaller. Could you plan a weekend camping trip or a day hike? Getting into nature, even briefly, can help clear your head and give you perspective. Plus, it lets you ""test drive"" that mountain lifestyle fantasy in a manageable way.

Also, please consider talking to a therapist. That long-term feeling of being unfulfilled since childhood is worth exploring with a professional who can help you develop better coping tools than escapism.

You're not alone in feeling this way. Many of us struggle with finding purpose and direction.","

tjg8w0,Anxiety,Does anybody else cope by just looking forward to going to sleep,Putrid-Substance-952,"A coping mechanism I have is that I‚Äôll sort of get through the hours of the day until it is nighttime and I know I can have the sweet release of sleep soon. Of course this isn‚Äôt every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it‚Äôs the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don‚Äôt mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day.

Sleep can feel like hitting a reset button when anxiety is overwhelming - it's like a guaranteed peaceful break from all the mental noise. I do this too sometimes, especially during rough patches.

While it's not necessarily unhealthy to look forward to sleep as a refuge, maybe we could work on making the waking hours feel a bit more manageable too? Have you tried breaking your day into smaller chunks instead of just waiting for bedtime? Like setting little milestones or scheduling small things to look forward to throughout the day?

That said, I don't think you should feel bad about using sleep as a coping mechanism. We all have our ways of getting through tough times, and as long as you're still functioning and having good days mixed in there, it's okay. Just make sure you're not using sleep to completely avoid dealing with the underlying anxiety - maybe consider talking to someone professional about managing those feelings if you haven't already.

You're doing what works for you right now, and that's valid. Be gentle with yourself.","

POST TITLE: Does anybody else cope by just looking forward to going to sleep

POST BODY: A coping mechanism I have is that I‚Äôll sort of get through the hours of the day until it is nighttime and I know I can have the sweet release of sleep soon. Of course this isn‚Äôt every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it‚Äôs the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don‚Äôt mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day. I still have plenty of days where I am enjoying the things through the day, but even on those days when 5 hours fly by I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh bonus I‚Äôm closer to bed‚Äù.

Some days it‚Äôs like my only hope though where I am really all over the place and it‚Äôs my anchor to keep going. Idk, I‚Äôm sure it sounds bad that I ‚Äúlook forward to going to sleep everyday‚Äù but I find it a pretty good coping mechanism.

Here, have a gold!",16,[deleted],"That's such a lovely way to practice self-care! Bad days can really wear us down, and instead of dwelling on it, you chose to do something nice for yourself. Sushi is literally the perfect comfort food too - it's special enough to feel like a treat but also nourishing and satisfying.

I love how you're encouraging others to be kind to themselves as well. Sometimes we forget that it's okay to have rough days and that treating ourselves isn't selfish - it's necessary for our wellbeing. Whether it's good food, a relaxing bath, or just taking a moment to breathe, these little acts of kindness to ourselves can make such a difference.

Hope tomorrow is better for you! But even if it's not, you've got a healthy way of handling it. Thanks for the wholesome reminder that we all deserve a little TLC sometimes. üç£‚ú®","

Dental anxiety is incredibly common, especially after traumatic experiences as a child.

It's amazing how many dentists nowadays are really understanding about dental anxiety and past trauma. They've seen it all before and genuinely just want to help people have healthy teeth - no judgment needed. You took such a brave step going in after 13 years!

The relief you must feel now is totally worth pushing through that fear. And you're absolutely right - sharing success stories like this really helps others who are in the same boat. Sometimes just knowing you're not alone in these fears, and that others have overcome them, can make such a difference.

I experience this too and it took me a while to recognize that my irritability and outbursts were actually anxiety in disguise.

What you're describing about going into ""fight"" mode makes total sense - anxiety triggers our fight/flight/freeze response, and some of us are more prone to the ""fight"" reaction. While your parents' temperament may have influenced how you learned to process stress, the anger response to anxiety can develop in anyone.

The good news is that this can absolutely be managed better with the right tools. Some things that have helped me:
- Learning to recognize early physical signs of anxiety before it turns to anger
- Taking breaks when feeling overwhelmed
- Deep breathing exercises
- Working with a therapist to develop better coping strategies

Don't beat yourself up about this - your brain is trying to protect you, just in a not-so-helpful way. With awareness and practice, you can start redirecting that anxious energy more constructively. Therapy can be especially helpful in unpacking any learned behaviors from childhood and developing new responses.","

Obsessive and intrusive thoughts. Panic. Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

It's like our minds get stuck in this endless worry loop, and we completely forget we have this amazing physical vessel that's trying to tell us what it needs.

I love how you've discovered that the body-mind connection works both ways - that caring for your body can actually quiet those racing thoughts. Your list is fantastic, and I especially appreciate that you included simple, accessible things like breathing and stretching alongside more involved activities.

One thing that helped me was setting phone reminders for basic body check-ins throughout the day. Just a quick ""How's my breathing? Are my shoulders tense? When did I last drink water?"" It helped make body awareness more of a habit rather than something I only think about when I'm already overwhelmed.

You're absolutely right - the body is the boss, and sometimes the best way to help our anxious minds is to start with taking care of our physical selves. Thanks for sharing this reminder - it's something many of us with anxiety need to hear regularly.","

Here's something that helps me: Anxiety lies. It's like wearing glasses that distort everything you see. The fact that your fianc√© chose to be with you and wants to build a future with you speaks volumes more than these anxious thoughts.

Have you considered sharing these feelings with your fianc√©? Sometimes just saying ""Hey, my anxiety is really loud right now and making me doubt things"" can help. Most people who love us want to know when we're struggling, and being vulnerable often strengthens relationships rather than weakening them.

Remember: Your anxiety is not reality, even though it feels incredibly real in the moment. You're not garbage - you're a human being dealing with some really tough thought patterns. Be gentle with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

i8b15i,Anxiety,Today was a great day no anxiety attacks at all,thunde-r,Today was a great day so far no anxiety attacks nothing I felt calm and happy and energized I just wanted to share god bless you all,1210,47,1597226555,That's great!! I hope you have another amazing day tomorrow! üòä,47,jazzgirl804,"How do you cope? Do you use an app or therapy, or did you just kinda figured it out on your own?",2,Josh43121,"That's fantastic to hear! As someone who understands how draining anxiety can be, those good days feel absolutely amazing. It's so important to celebrate these victories and really take note of how you're feeling in these moments - the calmness, happiness, and energy you described.

Maybe take a few minutes to reflect on what made today different? Sometimes identifying the little things that help create good days can give us tools for managing harder ones. Could be anything from getting better sleep, eating well, or just having a more relaxed schedule.

Keep riding this positive wave! And remember, even if anxiety shows up again tomorrow or next week, having this good day proves that peaceful, anxiety-free moments are possible. You've got this, and thank you for sharing your win with us - it gives hope to others who are working through similar challenges. üí™","

k1zgk0,Anxiety,Are you ever accidentally rude?,UnicornDust1860,"Do you ever panic in a social situation and end up being accidentally rude? But then you panic again because you don‚Äôt want people to think you‚Äôre rude, cause you‚Äôre really not, it was just a bad moment?",1130,127,1606476246,i do because i have high anxiety sometimes and it makes me snappy :( today im anxious for no reason again and i just look so grumpy too,254,darkywitch,,0,,"Oh my gosh, yes - this happens to me more than I'd like to admit! Social anxiety can make us overthink things and sometimes that nervousness comes out in ways we don't intend. I've definitely had moments where I've given short answers or awkwardly cut conversations short because I was feeling overwhelmed, then spent way too much time later worrying that I came across as rude.

What helps me is remembering that most people are pretty understanding and probably don't analyze our behavior nearly as much as we do. If you realize you might have come across as rude, it's totally okay to circle back with a quick ""Hey, sorry if I seemed off earlier - I was feeling a bit anxious/overwhelmed."" Most people really appreciate that kind of honesty.

Also, try to be gentle with yourself. Having occasional awkward moments doesn't make you a rude person - it just makes you human. We all have those moments where our words or actions don't perfectly align with our intentions.","

g78nn7,Anxiety,I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,Sinister-Laugher,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today. I have two assignments due later today and I feel confident that I'm gonna get them done and turned in today.",1188,68,1587736020,"As someone who has taught, I can tell you that no matter how many mistakes you made, you were his favorite student this morning. Best of luck on your exam. Salud!",551,jnonymous330,That's great OP! Keep it up and best of luck for your oral interview.,157,par_android,"This actually sounds like it turned into a really great opportunity! One-on-one language practice with a professor is something most students would pay extra for. I totally get that initial panic feeling - being the only student there puts all the spotlight on you. But it sounds like your professor handled it perfectly by being patient and supportive.

Making mistakes is absolutely part of learning a language. The fact that you stuck with it instead of making an excuse to leave shows real dedication. Plus, getting extra practice with past tense right before your oral interview? That's honestly perfect timing.

It's awesome that this experience gave you a confidence boost for your other assignments too. Sometimes just having one positive interaction early in the day can set the tone for getting things done. Keep that momentum going!

And hey, props to you for showing up to class when others didn't - that kind of commitment really pays off in the long run, especially with language learning.","

gquc6o,Anxiety,Anxiety makes the smallest criticism feel like an absolute condemnation,seniilisiili,"I already feel like a burden to everyone around me, so whenever someone criticizes me of a relatively small thing (justly) I spiral into this pit where I think that I'm making other people's lives worse by being a piece of shit. Drinking two cups of coffee in the morning probably didn't help either... üòÖ

Any tips on how to shake this feeling off?",1213,42,1590487972,"I relate to this so much, I‚Äôve internalized even the smallest critique for years and hold onto it, it‚Äôs an awful thing 

This might sound a little wishy-washy but I‚Äôve found writing daily affirmations has started to help me accept my imperfections, ones I write regarding this issue are: ‚ÄòI am not my mistakes‚Äô ‚ÄòIn every struggle lies a learning experience‚Äô and ‚ÄòI forgive myself‚Äô. Sounds silly but the more I write them out and say them it tricks my brain into believing it more.

Also doing something I‚Äôm bad at (for me, starting ballet again) has been helpful in that case bc I make a LOT of mistakes and get critiqued by my teacher, but it‚Äôs been pushing me to accept that I will never be perfect, and criticism is inevitable, but if I do my best i will be proud of myself. 

Not sure if any of this is helpful, I think it‚Äôs about sitting with yourself and working out what exercises  you can give yourself to challenge that particular anxiety. Good luck and remember none of us will ever be perfect, and growth is a good thing!",55,brittanica_7,"Yeah I can't even express how much I feel this. One thing that really helps is reminding yourself that people understand that you don't mean anything bad by what you're doing and, they will mainly appreciate that you listened to them and cared enough about them to want to change.
Also! Remember to think positively about yourself, it helps you to remember nice things that people say about you. Take care of yourself, I hope things get better!",52,cimwolf,"I totally get this - anxiety has a way of turning minor critiques into these huge emotional avalanches. That ""I'm a burden"" thought pattern is so familiar, and it's exhausting how our brains can spiral from one small comment into feeling completely worthless.

First thing - maybe dial back the coffee a bit? Caffeine can definitely amplify anxiety and make everything feel more intense. Try cutting back to one cup or switching to half-caf.

More importantly though, try to remember that receiving criticism doesn't make you a bad person - it's just part of being human. Everyone makes mistakes or has room for improvement. The fact that you're so concerned about your impact on others actually shows that you're thoughtful and caring.

When you feel that spiral starting, try to pause and ask yourself: ""Is this criticism actually about my whole worth as a person, or is it just about one specific action?"" Usually it's the latter.

You're not a burden. You're a person doing their best, just like everyone else. Be as gentle with yourself as you'd be with a friend in the same situation. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I deal with the same thing - lying there worried about not sleeping, which then makes it even harder to sleep. It's like your brain gets stuck in this awful feedback loop.

Something that's helped me break this cycle is accepting that even if I don't sleep perfectly, I'll still be okay the next day. When I stopped putting so much pressure on myself to sleep, it actually became easier. I also started doing ""boring"" mental exercises when anxious thoughts creep in - like counting backward from 500 by 7s or mentally redecorating my bedroom. It gives my mind something to focus on besides anxiety.

Have you tried any sleep podcasts or meditation apps? ""Sleep With Me"" is a great podcast - the host just rambles about random stuff in a super monotone voice. It's so boring it actually helps! 

Remember, you're not alone in this struggle. Anxiety and sleep issues are super common, even though it feels isolating when you're lying there at 3 AM. Be gentle with yourself - you're doing the best you can. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

This goes for traveling as well.,744,ultraarmadillo,"Eat out, go to gigs, go on holidays",42,lil_violet,"I feel this deeply. Trying new restaurants is also one of my biggest anxiety triggers - worrying about not knowing the menu, where to sit, if I'll order ""wrong"" or look awkward eating alone if I go by myself.

Something that's helped me is looking up the menu and photos online beforehand so I feel more prepared. Also, going during off-peak hours when it's less crowded has made it easier to start. Sometimes I'll even tell myself ""I'm just going to walk in and if it feels too overwhelming, I can always leave - no pressure.""

Started with small steps - first getting takeout from new places, then visiting casual spots during quiet hours, and slowly working up to busier restaurants. Each successful experience builds a little more confidence.

Would you maybe want to start with a casual lunch spot? Or bring a supportive friend who understands your anxiety? Remember that most people are focused on their own meals and aren't paying attention to others. You deserve to enjoy new food experiences! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I'm dying to know.,8,nonewnamesyo,"I totally get this! It's like when you've been carrying a heavy backpack for so long that when you finally take it off, you feel weirdly lightweight and almost floaty. The contrast between chronic anxiety and genuine calm can feel absolutely surreal.

It's actually really insightful that you've noticed this difference - it shows you're becoming more aware of how anxiety has been affecting your daily life. That awareness is super valuable because it can motivate positive change, exactly like you're describing.

Your metaphor of anxiety being like a plastic bag over your head is spot-on. We sometimes get so used to struggling to breathe that we forget it's not normal or healthy. The fact that you're experiencing these moments of calm is fantastic - it's like your brain is getting a preview of what life could be like with better anxiety management.

Keep pursuing that feeling of calm! Maybe start keeping notes about what circumstances lead to these peaceful moments. It could help you identify triggers and develop better coping strategies. You've already taken the first big step by recognizing the difference.","

Your offer to be there for others is exactly what some folks need right now - just knowing there are caring people out there willing to listen without judgment can make such a difference. The chosen family we build can be just as meaningful (sometimes more so) than the one we're born into.

Please try not to let that person's comment discourage you. The fact that you're actively working on managing your anxiety shows incredible self-awareness and strength. Progress happens in small steps, and that's completely okay. Have you considered reaching out to your college's counseling services? Many schools offer free resources specifically for students dealing with anxiety.

Today I had the worst day I've had in a while. Very similar to the situations you described. Just as I thought I was becoming pretty good at this adulting thing, it felt like I had reverted to being a little kid. Scared of making mistakes. Unable to control my behavior. It was an awful feeling. I'm glad it's over now, but like you, it's pretty fucking humiliating. And disappointing...you feel like you're getting your shit together and then everything just falls apart again one by one.

I don't know what you can do. All I know of is just find some degree of peace tonight and start again tomorrow. I wonder, are you always so anxious that you get tearful? Or do you normally just feel bad but without crying?

Have you been comparing yourself to other people a lot more lately, like there's something to lose if you aren't the best (e.g. a new coworker that might perform better than you, a new mutual friend with your partner that might get new attention, hope that you could successfully achieve your goals if you don't do well at your current job now)? All of those things can stack up and it sounds like maybe you have a lot more behind your anxiety than usual since you're posting this.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm finding that my returning depression is making my anxiety a lot more crybaby-ish and prone to catastrophizing than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Sending good vibes. Let's try to make tomorrow a little better (or more realistically, just not as bad).",19,vitamin-water,"I really feel for you - what you're describing isn't just ""being too sensitive,"" it sounds like you're dealing with some serious anxiety and perfectionism that's making everyday interactions feel overwhelming. Please know you're not alone in this - many people struggle with emotional regulation and fear of criticism, even if it's not always visible.

Instead of trying to ""grow a thicker skin,"" I'd really encourage you to talk to a therapist who can help you develop healthy coping strategies. They can teach you techniques to manage anxiety in the moment and work through the underlying fears about not being good enough.

In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. When you feel tears coming, take slow deep breaths and remind yourself that making mistakes is a normal, human thing. Maybe try reframing criticism as feedback that helps you grow rather than proof of failure.

You're not broken or unfit for this world. You're someone who cares deeply about doing well, and with the right support and tools, you can learn to channel that conscientiousness in a way that doesn't feel so overwhelming.","

POST TITLE: I am too sensitive for this world

POST BODY: Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can‚Äôt figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it‚Äôs humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I‚Äôm turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can‚Äôt seem to win. I can‚Äôt even check my email anymore because I‚Äôm so afraid to see someone saying I‚Äôve done something wrong. I don‚Äôt feel as if I was made to fit into this world where I can‚Äôt even be told I‚Äôm not doing good enough without completely breaking down. What can I even do? I feel like I‚Äôve lost all control of my life.

jxqat0,Anxiety,"Does anyone else feel like, they annoy everyone.",[deleted],"Every interaction i have, is unconfortable for me. I feel like, if i text someone, im taking their time, annoying them. If i speak to someone, my voice annoys them. So i shut up. But is it worth it?
Anyone else feels like this?",1168,77,1605883663,"I‚Äôve felt like that for all of high school. Truth is: if you really were annoying, people would tell you, believe me. Or people would avoid you and would not speak to you. 
I used to think like that because I was extremely self conscious due to being bullied for years. I thought no one would like me and I was a burden. 
But I wasn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm pretty sure you aren‚Äôt as well. 
Ask people you trust about this. It‚Äôs scary, but it helps. Ask them if your voice sounds weird and tell them how you feel about wasting their time. I‚Äôm sure their answers will calm you down and make you more confident. You can use this to work on yourself and get better. 
I for myself can say that I don‚Äôt think you are annoying and you did not waste my time by asking this.

Edit: I just saw some of your other posts. Dude, come here, take this virtual hug. 
I hope you are ok. It will get better.",144,Necessary-Ad-3753,"I am not sure if I annoy or just offend people tbh. Sometimes I see that they are angry, or there is something wrong with what I've said. And I know it is not just in my mind, cause people don't engage with me much.

Sometimes I even say to them to tell me if I am being insensitive or smth. But they never do.

Maybe they think I'm stupid, cause my thoughts wander a lot and I cannot give them a straight answer right away. Or maybe they think I'm borring.

I've got used to it so I just take it as a part of my life.

I've tried a therapist but it was a bad match and maybe I would do it again someday with someone else.

Don't realy have anything positive here, so sorry.
Maybe try to see what are the facts? Are there people that care about you? Is there someone who speaks to you? Anxiety can lie realy good.",5,Disappointedburritoo,"I know exactly what you mean, and please know you're not alone in feeling this way. What you're describing sounds a lot like social anxiety and negative self-talk - I've been there myself, constantly feeling like I'm bothering people just by existing.

Here's the thing though - most people are way too caught up in their own thoughts to be analyzing your every move. And those who choose to interact with you (texting back, talking to you) are doing so because they want to. If you were truly annoying them, they wouldn't engage.

Try challenging these thoughts when they come up. Ask yourself: ""What actual evidence do I have that I'm annoying them?"" Usually, it's just our anxiety creating worst-case scenarios in our heads.

Don't shut yourself away - isolation will only make these feelings worse. You deserve to take up space in this world and have meaningful connections with others. Have you considered talking to a therapist about these feelings? They can help you develop tools to manage these thoughts.

Remember: your presence has value, even when your brain tries to tell you otherwise.","

When we're in those dark moments, everything can feel overwhelming and permanent. Breaking it down into tiny, manageable actions really does help interrupt that downward spiral.

I've found that making my bed can be that small win for me - even if I end up getting right back in it, there's something about that tiny bit of order that helps. Sometimes it leads to doing another small thing, and another. But even if it doesn't, that's okay too. The goal isn't to fix everything at once, it's just to remind ourselves that we're still here and still trying.

And to anyone reading this who's struggling right now: Your worth isn't measured by your productivity or how ""well"" you're handling things. Sometimes just existing through the hard days is enough. Take that one small step when you can, and be gentle with yourself along the way.

Rewatching familiar shows is actually a really common self-soothing behavior, especially during anxious times. It's like comfort food for your brain - you know exactly what to expect, there are no unwelcome surprises, and you can just relax into the familiar storylines and characters.

I do this too with shows like The Office and Parks & Rec. There's something really calming about putting on a show where you already know all the jokes and plot twists. Scientists have even studied this phenomenon and found that rewatching favorite content can help restore a sense of control and predictability when we're feeling stressed.

Don't feel bad about not always wanting to try new shows. Sometimes our brains just need that comfortable, low-stakes entertainment to help us decompress. As long as it's helping you manage your anxiety in a healthy way, keep doing what works for you! Regular Show is a solid choice btw - that show has some great rewatch value.","

Every time we face our fears, push through a panic attack, or simply get out of bed on a tough day, we're proving our resilience.

One thing that helps me is remembering that anxiety lies to us. It tells us we can't handle things when history shows we've handled so much already. Every storm we've weathered makes us more experienced and capable, even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment.

Wishing you and everyone here a year filled with more peace, self-compassion, and moments of joy. We're all in this together, and there's strength in knowing we're not alone in this fight. Thanks for spreading some light and hope! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Any tips on how to stop doing this?

You're definitely not alone in this!

A few things that helped me reduce this habit:
- Being mindful when you catch yourself doing it - just notice without judgment and try to slowly release
- Using sugar-free gum or hard candies to keep your mouth occupied
- Applying lip balm regularly (the texture difference makes you more aware)
- Finding alternative stress relief like squeezing a stress ball or using fidget toys
- Deep breathing exercises before bed when anxiety tends to spike

The most important thing is to be patient with yourself. This is a coping mechanism your body developed to deal with anxiety, so beating yourself up about it won't help. Maybe consider talking to a therapist if the anxiety feels overwhelming - they can teach you specific techniques to manage it.

Hope some of these suggestions help! Remember you're not weird or alone in this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

And then you feel guilty?,OhSampai,"This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can‚Äôt?

Can anyone relate or am I crazy?",1191,52,1597089303,Yes!,43,Chem_love,,0,,"You're definitely not crazy, and you're not alone in this. What you're describing is actually pretty common with anxiety and depression - that paralyzing combination of caring intensely about being on time while simultaneously struggling to take action. It's like your brain is fighting itself.

I've found that breaking down the getting-ready process into tiny, manageable steps helps. Instead of thinking ""I need to get ready and leave,"" try ""I just need to sit up in bed"" or ""I just need to put one sock on."" Sometimes tricking your brain with these micro-steps can help bypass that overwhelming paralysis.

Also, try to be gentler with yourself. Depression makes simple tasks feel like climbing mountains, and beating yourself up only makes it harder to move forward. Maybe talk to your therapist (if you have one) about this specific challenge - they might have some strategies tailored to your situation.

Remember: This isn't a character flaw - it's a symptom of very real mental health challenges you're dealing with. You're not pathetic or lazy; you're struggling with something difficult.","

Maybe next time anxiety tries to stop you from doing something, you can remember this victory. You've got proof now that you can push through the uncomfortable feelings and come out the other side with a clean car and a win under your belt!

Sometimes just yelling it into the void (or Reddit!) can actually help release some of that tension - so good call on getting it out there!

If you're still feeling wired, maybe try this quick thing: Take a deep breath, then tense up EVERY muscle in your body for like 5 seconds (yeah, get real dramatic with it), then release everything while exhaling slowly. Sounds silly but it can help trick your body into relaxing a bit.

Hope your weekend gets better, friend. Anxiety's a real beast sometimes, but this moment will pass. Feel free to keep venting if you need to - that's what we're here for. ü§úü§õ

It's like your body completely betrays your original ""let's be productive!"" plan.

Have you considered trying lower caffeine alternatives? Green tea gives me a gentler boost without the jitters, and L-theanine supplements can help smooth out caffeine's edge if you take them together. Some people also swear by half-caf or switching to cold brew since it's supposedly less acidic.

Don't beat yourself up about having to play it cool during lunch - panic attacks are rough enough without the added pressure of hiding them in public. Most of us who deal with anxiety have gotten pretty good at the whole ""everything's fine!"" act while internally freaking out.

Maybe take it easy for the rest of today if you can. That post-panic exhaustion is no joke. Tomorrow's another day to experiment with better energy solutions that work for your body. Sending good vibes your way!","

jcfzk4,Anxiety,I did it! I asked for a girls number today.,LunarDragon17,"I'm a junior in college, and I've never dated or even kissed a girl because of my Social Anxiety Disorder holding me back. I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

UPDATE: I texted her some, but she seldom replied, and even when she did, she didn't very interested. I don't think anything will come out of this, but this was a huge milestone for me and I'm proud of myself nonetheless!",1167,72,1602874890,Anxious dude here.

Damn, all the good! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",20,Adsobecool,"Hey man, this is seriously awesome and you should be really proud of yourself! As someone who also dealt with social anxiety, I know exactly how huge this victory is - that gut-churning feeling you described is so real, and you pushed through it anyway. That takes real courage.

Don't get too discouraged about this particular outcome. The biggest win here isn't whether she texted back or not - it's that you proved to yourself you CAN do this. You faced your fear and took action, and that's something to celebrate. Each time you push yourself out of your comfort zone like this, it gets a little easier.

Think of it like leveling up in a game - you just unlocked a new achievement! The next time you want to ask someone for their number, you'll be able to look back on this moment and know that you're capable of doing it.

Keep this momentum going, and remember: rejection is just part of dating for everyone. What matters is that you're putting yourself out there. Great job man!","

You are right, your mental health is yours and shouldn't appear on Internet without your consent.

I don't know in your country but in mine, your boss don't have the right to know why you're ill when you don't come at work because of privacy. So, if your job (where you pass the most of your time) don't have the right to know, I think your mom's friends don't need to know either.

Mental health struggles are deeply personal, and you have every right to control who knows about your medical information - including hospital stays. Your mom may think she's showing concern or seeking support, but she's violating your boundaries and trust in the process.

You handled it really maturely by first asking privately and then making a firm but polite public comment. Don't feel bad about that approach - sometimes people need to face social consequences to understand the impact of their actions.

Since you're living at home, maybe try having another calm conversation with her when things cool down. Explain that while you appreciate her concern, sharing your private medical info makes you feel exposed and damages your trust in her. Maybe suggest healthier ways she can express her worry, like talking to you directly or joining a private support group for parents.

Stay strong and keep maintaining those boundaries. Your mental health journey is yours to share (or not share) as you see fit.","

mhlufw,Anxiety,Please stop medication shaming,Suspicious_Loan,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",893,346,1617244920,"""What? You're taking antibiotics? You're not strong enough to fight that infection on your own. Have you tried fitness instead, bro?""",257,Mango__Loco,"Fortunately, this isn't a phenomenon that happens too much around this sub specifically but it's rampant elsewhere particularly from people selling snake oil and life coach ""anxiety is simple to fix"" mumbo jumbo. I have widespread brain damage resulting from an acquired brain injury (ABI), bilateral intraventricular brain hemorrhages as a very young child. Naturally, brain damage makes me high risk for all sorts of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. I seem to have ended up with a bunch of fear-related conditions - GAD, panic disorder, phobias, and trichotillomania which is a misguided attempt to cope and self-soothe. My therapist has been zero help for my GAD. CBT has been helpful for learning to cope with panic attacks and reduce my hair pulling, but not for GAD...when you're unreasonably anxious about everything and nothing and you know it but you can neither stop it nor ignore it, there's no rationalizing it away. Medication was the biggest help for my GAD, not therapy, the only thing that treats the root of the problem. Sometimes therapy and meditation and coping skills are just band-aids, they just treat the symptoms.

Going to a psychiatrist and starting meds was the best decision I ever made. Every person's experience is different, I can only share my own. The hardest thing about psychotropic medication is that it is usually not a quick fix, more like a scavenger hunt. You have to find the ""right"" medication for you, the one that works for you is unique to your disorder, genes and brain chemistry. If you take the wrong one, it may work but have intolerable side effects or may in fact actually make your anxiety worse even after the first few weeks of adjustment have passed (some only temporarily worsen anxiety, but that stops after a few weeks and then it improves past baseline).

I'd been in therapy for about nine months before I took the plunge and gone through two therapists. Both of my therapists were upfront with me after I'd been in treatment for a while, like ""in your case therapy is not likely to be sufficient"", they told me they could only be so helpful when anxiety is very severe. Does therapy help me manage my anxiety? Yes. Does it help me *stop* it? Hell no. I wanted my anxiety *gone* and that's not something CBT is capable of, that's not what it's designed to do. It just teaches you to cope with your illness.

Because of that, on therapy alone it's basically an endless, futile, fruitless fight between my coping skills and reframing and whatnot...and my brain. My anxiety has a *huge* impact on my functioning. Therapy, exercise, meditation, all those things have their place, but they also have their *limits*. It's not a panacea. None of that shit could stop the infinite storm of anxiety in my brain, the ruminating, the panic attacks, the nightmares and insomnia and compulsive hair pulling to the point of bleeding. Medication was the missing piece for me. I work at a mental health agency IRL so I don't have the fear of treatment and medication that some seem to. Medication and therapy combined are clinically proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety. Taking medication reduces your anxiety enough that you find that you are more receptive to therapeutic techniques, therapy becomes more useful and you're able to make more progress in therapy.

I take Citalopram/Celexa and it's magic. I have zero irrational anxiety - the sickening pit of dread is gone. I also take hydroxyzine for insomnia and for occasional panic attacks with success. Whatever is wrong with my brain that causes this intolerable anxiety and panic - Celexa fixes it. It's basically magic. Sometimes there's a biological cause, a difference in your brain, and medication gets to the root of the problem, and therapy and lifestyle changes only help manage the symptoms. 

Here's the thing about the side effects monster: for severe anxiety, you'd need some truly mad side effects to outweigh the benefits of the eradication of your anxiety. That's a *huge* benefit. *Most* ""side effects"" are more aptly named *adjustment effects* because they usually disappear by the end of the first month. You can handle that, you've lasted this long through insane anxiety, haven't you? For me, my adjustment effect was dry mouth. Big whoop. Nothing difficult there, gone like the wind by the end of the third week. Long-term, I have nothing more sinister on the three drugs I take than increased diarrhea which is no big deal whatsoever, because:

   A. I already had daily diarrhea anyway. It's 99% painless, merely annoying and an anxiety symptom regardless (as are most drug side effects), and 

   B. My anxiety was so severe that I'd have to have some truly gnarly, completely awful and intolerable side effects to make me even *consider* stopping...and none of the possible side effects of my drugs fall into that category. My SSRI has improved my life *exponentially.*

There are obviously people who have serious side effects and bad reactions, but drug manufacturers are legally obligated to report everything that everyone in trials *perceived* as ""side effects"", even if only three people out of 10,000 experienced it, and even if that 'side effect' may not have been related to the drug at all - just coincidentally happened while they were doing the drug trial, so therefore people's brains (hello, anxiety!) immediately jump to worst case ""oh shit, it's the drug!"". For a lot of those serious side effects (sexual side effects excluded), your chances of experiencing them is pretty damn low.

For online reviews, you're setting yourself up for failure from the start because it's like anything else; the happy people are not motivated to leave reviews, they're off living their lives, only the people who had bad experiences do, so it's skewed toward the negative. Often, people don't follow their medication regimen as they should: they mention that they start too high, they quit cold turkey, they skip doses, they take it on an empty stomach instead of with food, they stop after two days or two weeks and then complain it's the medication instead of user error. 

I've also seen my share of reviews that gave a bad rating not actually for any negative experience *on* the drug but because when they *stopped,* their anxiety came back and they were mad about it. No shit, Sherlock, what did you expect? You were feeling better *because* of the pills, why did you stop? 

It's like every other medical condition - you have a condition, you take medicine for it, symptoms go away. You stop taking medicine, symptoms come back. Anxiety. High blood pressure. Diabetes. Epilepsy. Arthritis. Everything. That is how medicine *works,* when nothing is there to hold back the tide of your condition, *obviously* it will come back and you'll experience symptoms again. You do still have to *work* to  control your medical condition, yes, like everyone else on the planet. 

Anyway, no amount of CBT in the world could do what Celexa does for me. The only problems I still have are my trichotillomania and uncontrollable nightmares, both of which have been my constant companion for sixteen years now. I have nightmares all night, every night, and wake up every 60-90 minutes usually in a cold sweat, shaking or crying, I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night, when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. I just recently had my very first good dreams in sixteen years and I suppose I can thank my Celexa for that (honestly a miracle), but before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Therapy was useless for it. I have found nothing to help. 

SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to work and for the first few weeks, Citalopram did nothing. Nothing good, nothing bad. And then all of a sudden one day it *worked*, I realized...I'm *calm*. I'd forgotten what that felt like. It had been sixteen years since I'd known that feeling. And I'm going on five months and that feeling has persisted. It's *beautiful.* I feel *normal.* I feel like *me* and I'd forgotten who that was, the person who isn't constantly hounded and crippled by anxiety and panic. I still get stressed in situations that would cause a normal, non-anxious person anxiety, but the constant, sickening pit of dread is gone thanks to my medication. I can't say enough good things about my experience with Celexa. The day I went to the psychiatrist for the first time is the best day of my life, no contest. 

I didn't think this was possible. Let me repeat that: I *work* at a mental health agency, and I was so far down the hole that there was no light. I'd been in therapy and while it helped with behavioral things, like coping with panic attacks and distracting myself, choosing behavioral alternatives to pulling my hair to self-sooth, therapy alone didn't and *couldn't* help as much as I wanted. It did nothing for my irrational, panicked brain - because that's just the nature of my brain, fundamentally. It's a disorder. I didn't know that *calm* was an achievable state for me anymore. I began therapy after a breakdown during a panic attack...I tried to amputate my fingers and realized there was no more denying it, this was obviously a disorder (turns out, a lot of them actually) and not an unfortunate assortment of flaws and personality quirks like I'd spent fifteen years desperately trying to convince myself. Starting medication was easily the best decision of my life and had a huge impact on my happiness, my functioning, every aspect of my life. I was constantly making myself sick with worry over the *stupidest* things, and even over absolutely nothing, and I knew it was stupid but I *couldn't stop*.

I could kiss my psychiatrist, I owe her my life.",14,larki18,"I totally get your frustration. The medication shaming in the anxiety community is real, and it's especially disappointing coming from people who should understand how debilitating anxiety can be. Everyone's journey is different, and what works for one person won't work for another.

I'm on benzos too, and they literally saved my life during my darkest times. While I understand the concerns about these medications, the reality is that for some of us, they're a necessary tool in our recovery. You and your doctor know what's best for your situation.

It's great that you found a therapist who validates your experience and understands that sometimes medication is absolutely necessary. That ""addiction"" comparison your therapist dealt with is so frustrating and shows how ignorant people can be about mental health treatment.

Keep doing what works for you and try to ignore the shamers. Your mental health and quality of life matter more than their uninformed opinions. You're not weak for taking medication - you're strong for seeking the help you need.","

9zfspe,Anxiety,Anxiety is having to leave for work at a certain time even though you know you‚Äôre still going to be 30 minutes early,hannnsolo,I‚Äôm done with this ,1140,99,1542906061,"Anyone else get ready 20 minutes before you actually need to leave, then just sit around being anxious for 20 minutes?",253,Chimpsanddip,"For awhile this summer, I was nannying at different resorts around my area. I was about 1.5-2 hours early each time because I was so anxious about not knowing if there was traffic that time of day on that road, finding parking, finding the hotel, finding the hotel room, etc etc etc. It was too much",5,_criscodisco,"I feel this so hard. That anxious feeling of needing to leave super early ""just in case"" something happens, even though logically you know you'll be way too early... again. And then sitting in your car or walking around trying to kill time because you don't want to be the first one in the office.

Have you tried working backwards to establish a more realistic timeline? Like, actually timing your normal commute on a regular day, then adding 10-15 minutes as a reasonable buffer? Sometimes having concrete data helps challenge those anxious thoughts telling us we need to leave at the crack of dawn.

Also, it helped me to reframe being ""early"" as giving myself peaceful ""me time"" - I started bringing a book or using that extra time to grab coffee and decompress before work. Made it feel less like anxiety-driven behavior and more like an intentional choice.

But yeah, the time anxiety struggle is real. You're definitely not alone in this! üôå","

I don't have anxiety in the moment so much as I get post-social anxiety &amp; second guess myself afterwards",230,WesternQuestions,"I totally get this feeling - that pit in your stomach after sharing something personal and then wondering if you said too much. You're definitely not alone in this! I've had those same moments where I'll lie awake at night replaying conversations and cringing at how much I opened up.

Something that helps me is remembering that most people are way too focused on their own lives to spend much time thinking about what we've shared. Plus, being vulnerable and opening up is actually a really normal and healthy part of building relationships, even if it feels scary sometimes.

What I've learned to do is:
- Start small with personal sharing and gradually build trust
- Pay attention to how the other person reciprocates (do they share back?)
- Remind myself that having anxiety about this actually shows I'm a thoughtful person who cares about relationships

Try to be gentle with yourself. The fact that you're self-aware enough to think about this shows emotional intelligence. And honestly, the people who end up being real friends are usually the ones we can be authentic with, oversharing and all.","

kth64c,Anxiety,"I mentioned to my husband that I feel like crying and he asked, ""hm, how can we find out what's at the root of that?""",littlebirdbluess,"Y'all, find yourselves someone who will work through all your anxiety and depression with you because they love you enough to help you find the other side.",1114,123,1610156764,"I told my boyfriend about my anxiety from the get go. About 3 months in, I told him I was having a bad anxiety day and asked if I could come over. I was so scared of being rejected. My ex once told me my anxiety annoyed him. So... well... I'm sure you understand. 

Anyway, after he said yes and I was over, he put on a movie and put a pizza in the oven. After we ate and when the movie was over and I felt more relaxed, he asked me what happened. So I told him everything. And I was calm so I said it felt silly that I let this stuff get to me. And he said ""but it was important to you. Is there something we can do if this happens again? To help you calm down?""

Y'all... I held it in but when I was going home I was crying happy tears. He even told me I was always welcome when I had a bad day. And... it felt so nice to be heard, taken care of, and to have someone care enough to help me figure out how to manage things in the future. 

He has no experience with anxiety but he did his best and I still get emotional about it TO THIS DAY (1 year later).",338,lemondagger,that's beautiful! &lt;3 how long have you been together? if you don't mind me asking ofc,11,kdawgwatz,"This is so wholesome and such a great example of emotional support in a relationship. Your husband's response shows he's not just trying to ""fix"" your feelings or dismiss them - he's genuinely interested in understanding and helping you work through them together.

It's really beautiful when a partner approaches your emotions with curiosity and compassion rather than judgment or frustration. That simple question ""what's at the root of that?"" shows he sees you as a team tackling life's challenges together.

For anyone reading this who might be struggling in their relationships - this is exactly the kind of emotional intelligence and support to look for in a partner. Someone who validates your feelings while gently helping you understand them better.

You're absolutely right about finding someone who will work through the hard stuff with you. Mental health challenges are so much more manageable when you have a supportive partner in your corner. I'm really happy you have that kind of partnership! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

b25lyk,Anxiety,"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too",_partyof5_,"I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ‚ù§Ô∏è",1131,103,1552832427,"Great read. It's a battle but know that you are not alone. Going to try a few of your tips.

Thank you!",73,hkygys,This is absolutely great. Thank you for sharing. Would you mind if I shared this to my Facebook support group?,2,SocialAnxietyAndMe,"Thank you so much for sharing such a detailed and thoughtful list! As someone who also deals with anxiety, I really appreciate how you've broken down practical steps that actually work. The caffeine one especially resonates - I cut back (though not completely) and was amazed at how much it helped reduce my racing thoughts.

I love that you emphasized this is a process and not just flipping a switch. That's such an important mindset shift. And your point about accepting anxiety as part of who you are rather than fighting it is really powerful. It's similar to what my therapist calls ""making friends"" with anxiety instead of treating it like an enemy.

The confidence-building tip is brilliant too. It's easy to get caught in anxiety spirals and forget our capabilities. Focusing on what we're good at creates this positive feedback loop that helps counter anxious thoughts.

Keep up the amazing work! Posts like yours remind people they're not alone and there are concrete steps they can take to feel better. üíú","

I have spent an hour preparing. I have done breathing exercises to calm myself down and not cry. I prepared my bed for the ease of running away and hiding in it as soon as the phone call is done. I rehearsed my opening line and all possible outcomes. I considered just not calling, but told myself ""NO this is important, you can do this!""

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

Phone anxiety is so real, and the emotional roller coaster of psyching yourself up only to get voicemail is just... *ugh*. 

The silver lining (if you want to look at it this way) is that you can use this as a practice run. Now you've already gone through the hardest part - deciding to make the call and actually dialing. The next attempt might be a tiny bit easier since you've already broken that initial barrier.

Also, give yourself credit! You did the thing that scared you, even if it didn't connect. That's still a win in my book. Anxiety tried to stop you, but you pushed through anyway. That takes real courage.

Maybe next time, try calling during peak business hours if it's a business, or sending a quick text first if it's personal (""Hey, is now a good time for a quick call?""). It might help reduce the chance of getting voicemail and having to psych yourself up all over again.

That constant pull between wanting to stay informed and engaged versus protecting your mental health is really challenging, especially for empathetic people. The guilt about having the ""privilege"" to step away makes it even harder.

Here's the thing though - you can't effectively support causes or help others if you're completely burnt out. Think of it like putting on your own oxygen mask before helping others on a plane. Taking breaks from the news and social media isn't ignoring issues, it's maintaining your capacity to engage sustainably.

Maybe try setting specific times to check news (like once in the morning) and balance it with direct action when you can - whether that's volunteering locally, signing petitions, or donating small amounts. That way you stay connected to causes you care about while having boundaries that protect your mental health.

Remember: Being informed and being consumed by information are two different things. It's okay to take care of yourself - in fact, it's necessary if you want to keep being a good ally long-term.","

aipmmi,Anxiety,It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,6DEVIL,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me.""

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress.

My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder.

You deserve to be happy and not have this cloud over you all the time. Let us know if you ever need to talk about anything!  :)",28,NuttingWithTheForce,"I can totally relate to this realization - it's like suddenly having a name for something you've been carrying around your whole life without understanding it. I went through something similar, thinking my constant worry and social fears were just ""who I was"" until things got bad enough that I couldn't ignore it anymore.

The good news is that recognizing anxiety for what it is becomes a huge first step in managing it. You're already doing the right things by talking to your doctor and starting treatment. While Zoloft isn't a magic fix, many people find it helps take the edge off enough to work on developing better coping strategies.

Consider looking into therapy too if you haven't already - having someone help you unpack these long-held patterns and learn new tools can be really valuable. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) in particular has good success rates with anxiety.

Be patient with yourself as you navigate this new understanding. You're not alone in this journey, and there are definitely ways to make things better, even if progress comes gradually. Wishing you all the best with your treatment.","

Looking back, so many of my childhood ""quirks"" were textbook anxiety symptoms, but in the 90s/2000s, mental health awareness just wasn't there - especially for kids. It's both validating and heartbreaking when you finally connect those dots as an adult.

While the current situation with social distancing makes getting help harder, there are still some options. Many therapists are doing telehealth sessions now, and there are some good mental health apps and online support groups. Even journaling about your childhood experiences can be therapeutic - it helps validate that younger version of yourself who didn't understand what was happening.

Be gentle with yourself. You're already showing incredible self-awareness by recognizing these patterns, and that's a huge first step. That little girl did the best she could with the understanding she had at the time. Now you can be the supportive adult she needed back then, even if it's a bit later than ideal.

You're not alone in this journey. So many of us are unpacking similar realizations about our childhoods. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

imulai,Anxiety,I finished a whole grilled cheese!,raisedglazed,"Lately my anxiety has been making it hard to eat full meals/meals at all. I‚Äôve been barely choking down 4 bites of food at meal times and trying to supplement with nutrition drinks, all while feeling sick and nauseous almost all the time, and waking up starving in the mornings while still unable to eat much of anything.

I am so proud of you.,80,[deleted],"This is such a huge win - don't downplay it! As someone who's dealt with anxiety-induced appetite issues, I know exactly how overwhelming it can feel when your body and mind are fighting against something as basic as eating.

The way you handled it was really smart too - using deep breaths, self-reassurance, and distraction are all great coping techniques. And having supportive family members (like your dad making that grilled cheese) can make such a difference.

One thing that helped me during rough patches was starting with ""safe foods"" - simple, familiar things that felt less threatening. Grilled cheese was actually one of mine! You might want to keep a little list of foods that work better for you on anxious days.

Be proud of this victory! Every full meal is a step forward, even if you have some setbacks along the way. You're doing the right things by listening to your body while still gently pushing yourself to eat when possible. Keep it up! üí™","

The fact that you care about being helpful already shows you're bringing good energy to the community. Don't let a few downvotes silence your voice! Some of my most meaningful interactions on Reddit came after I stopped obsessing over the votes and just focused on being authentic.

While there's nothing wrong with wanting to nail a joke, try not to put too much pressure on yourself. Some of the best moments with friends come from spontaneous, imperfect interactions. They're your friends because they like YOU, not some perfectly rehearsed version of you.

Next time you catch yourself rehearsing, maybe try to laugh at it instead of beating yourself up. We're all just humans trying our best to be funny and connect with each other. And hey, at least you've got a funny story about forgetting to tell the joke now! üòÑ","

I try to be grateful because it‚Äôs a work from home position during this pandemic, but it‚Äôs hard to ignore how much I just don‚Äôt like having to try to collect debt from people over the phone (especially during this unfortunate time). It‚Äôs also hard to ignore how much stress the company has put on me in the last 2 weeks because they forced my entire team and I to promote for business need, with no raise.

It's like the peaceful ""me time"" is slipping away and you're already mentally living in tomorrow's stress. You're definitely not alone in this.

Something that's helped me is trying to reframe bedtime as self-care rather than just the end of relaxation. I started giving myself a proper wind-down routine - maybe some light stretching, reading, or calming music. It helps create a buffer between evening relaxation and sleep, rather than that jarring ""oh no, another day is coming"" feeling.

Also, if you're consistently dreading your days this much, it might be worth looking at what specific responsibilities are causing the most anxiety. Sometimes just identifying the main stressors can help you find ways to make them more manageable or break them into smaller chunks.

But yeah, that evening dread is really rough. Be gentle with yourself - it's a common struggle and doesn't make you any less capable of handling what tomorrow brings. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

What helps me is asking: ""What's the actual evidence for this fear?"" and ""What's the worst that could realistically happen?"" Often, writing these things down makes it easier to separate legitimate concerns from anxiety-driven catastrophizing.

Also, remember that making mistakes is okay. Sometimes you'll listen to the anxiety when you shouldn't have, and sometimes you'll ignore it when it was right. That's just part of being human. The goal isn't to make perfect decisions every time - it's to learn to trust yourself more while accepting that uncertainty is part of life.

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that‚Äôs how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called ‚ÄúBreath‚Äù by James Nestor. It‚Äôs an extraordinary piece of work.

I especially appreciate your point about breathing exercises - they're seriously underrated. When I'm spiraling about health concerns, focused breathing is often what brings me back to reality. That book recommendation is going on my list.

One thing I'd add to your excellent tips: consider limiting time spent googling symptoms. It rarely helps and usually makes anxiety worse. If you're genuinely concerned about something, see a doctor - it's much better than letting Dr. Google feed your fears.

Your message about self-love is spot on too. Sometimes anxiety makes us hyper-focused on every little thing ""wrong"" with our bodies, when really our bodies are doing their best to keep us going every day.

Thanks for spreading such positive vibes during what can be an especially anxious season for many of us.","

POST TITLE: You aren‚Äôt dying.

POST BODY: You aren‚Äôt dying. You don‚Äôt have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn‚Äôt been seen in decades. You aren‚Äôt going insane. You don‚Äôt have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it‚Äôs a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that‚Äôs how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called ‚ÄúBreath‚Äù by James Nestor. It‚Äôs an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you.

The breakfast video thing made me laugh because it's so true - there's this weird pressure to document every mundane moment. And for what? Like you said, it's mostly just a fake highlight reel anyway.

The best part about leaving social media is realizing who actually wants to maintain a real connection with you. Those people will text, call, or grab coffee. The others just wanted a passive audience for their posts, and that's fine - but you don't owe anyone that kind of access to your life.

Stay strong in your decision. Your mental health and privacy matter more than following some arbitrary social expectation to share everything online. The people who matter will understand, and the ones who don't... well, they're kind of proving your point about social media toxicity.","

fg3x6f,Anxiety,"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?",Vehicle_Voltron,"Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?",1127,96,1583795710,"Yes. I feel like I am drunk or hungover. My brain feels like mush. So I used that time to try and just experience, if that makes sense. Just lay in bed and feel- the bed, my clothes, etc. I essentially reset my brain and have a numbness. Breathing normally and shit

Edit: I'm so amazed and happy that so many people could relate to this! ‚ù§ it will get better... or I hope so",113,emilmetal,,0,,"Yes, what you're describing is actually very common with anxiety! It's called an ""anxiety hangover"" or ""emotional hangover,"" and it happens because your body releases a lot of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline during those high-anxiety events. Even after the event is over, it can take your system a while to return to baseline.

I experience this too, especially after social events or presentations. The physical symptoms you described - the shakiness, exhaustion, and heart palpitations - are all normal stress responses. Your body is essentially recovering from being in ""fight or flight"" mode.

Some things that help me:
- Planning a recovery day after big events
- Gentle exercise like walking to help burn off excess stress hormones
- Deep breathing exercises
- Staying hydrated and eating regularly
- Reminding myself that these feelings are temporary

If the heart palpitations are concerning you, it's worth mentioning them to your doctor just for peace of mind. But know that you're not alone in this experience, and it doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. Your body is just being a bit overprotective!","

You're absolutely right about how our fears from the past always seemed so huge in the moment, but somehow we got through them. It's hard to remember that when we're facing new challenges, but it's so true. We're all works in progress, and that's perfectly okay.

The part about being ""flawed but beautiful"" really hit home. We're often our own harshest critics, focusing on our imperfections while completely missing the unique and wonderful things that make us who we are.

Sometimes just knowing we're not alone in these feelings can make such a difference. Thanks for being that voice of compassion and reason today - I'm sure this message will help many others who are struggling right now.","

It's like my heart is trying to escape my chest, which of course makes me even more anxious because then I start worrying about my health, creating this awful feedback loop.

Those hot flashes you described are absolutely brutal though. I've found that besides ice packs, taking slow sips of really cold water helps me - it kind of ""resets"" my system a bit. Also, running my wrists under cold water for a minute can help cool down the whole body.

Have you tried any grounding techniques when this happens? Sometimes focusing on the physical sensation of the cold (like really paying attention to how the ice pack feels) can help pull your mind away from the anxiety spiral. It's not a cure-all, but every little bit helps when you're in the middle of it.

Just remember you're not alone in this. Anxiety symptoms really suck, but they will pass, even though it doesn't feel like it in the moment. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Love that you're taking the ""small steps"" approach. That's honestly one of the most effective ways to build yourself back up. Each little win adds to your confidence and makes the next challenge a bit easier to face.

Keep going at your own pace with addressing the mental health stuff. There's no rush, and you're already proving to yourself that you can make positive changes. If you haven't already, consider checking out some of the mental health resources available in the UK - lots of good free services out there.

7aimw8,Anxiety,Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can‚Äôt be at peace until you get it over with?,Yu-Gai-Hoh,"I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I‚Äôll be having fun for a second and then i‚Äôll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?",1124,95,1509706781,"I used to. Here's why it happens and how you can stop it.

The reason why is that you have trained your mind (and in reality, it has been trained by outside forces) to look at future events critically. If you're like me, you think of everything that can possibly go wrong when you go out, you think about hard it'll be, how tired you'll be. What if you miss the bus? What if there's traffic? What if the other person is late? What if what if what if.

What if is the poster child of the anxious thought. It can seem like a good idea, to prepare yourself for the next days tasks, but our problem is that we only ever think *negatively* about the next day.

But if doing things was ALWAYS negative, you wouldn't ever do things. 

So try this instead. Start to visualise what you need to do tomorrow entirely positively. Instead of thinking worst case, start to think best case. Imagine seeing your friend, and they're super happy to see you. Imagine the food you'll eat. Imagine the fresh air, blah blah. Just go through the next days task, imagining it entirely possible.

Anxiety and excitement feel quite similar when low level. So it's possible to reconfigure your mind to interpret that anxious feeling as just being excited for the next day.

After you complete the day, get some post it notes. Write three notes about the things you enjoyed that day, put em in a jar or something. 

Remember, anxiety occurs in your mind, and it colours your reality. But the same can be said for positive emotions. It's why so many people in life talk about it. If you start to think positively, your body will react as if something positive is happening. 

You can do it, you can cope, it's not too much for you! 

If you're still at a point where the anxiety is just too high to do this stuff, don't worry. You might need a little bit of CBT first, I found that helped me a huge amount. You might need to learn and practice some mindfulness techniques and meditation.

But it's entirely possible to rewrite your brain, so don't worry. If you keep going, keep trying, you can make it.",280,Kaiisim,I‚Äôm the opposite. Having something to do or somewhere to be helps me know that my worrying will cease cuz my mind will be on something else.  ,8,Carlosaro,"I totally get this - that nagging feeling in the back of your mind that just won't let you fully enjoy the present moment. It's like your brain has a permanent ""but tomorrow..."" notification that won't go away.

What's helped me is actually scheduling dedicated worry time. Sounds weird, but hear me out. I take 10 minutes each evening to write down everything I need to do tomorrow, make any quick preparations I can, and then mentally ""clock out."" Having it all on paper helps my brain let go, knowing I won't forget anything important.

Also, try reminding yourself that worrying about tomorrow won't make it any easier - it just steals joy from today. You're essentially experiencing the stress twice: once while anticipating it, and once while actually doing it.

When those thoughts creep in, acknowledge them briefly (""Yes, I have that thing tomorrow, and I'm prepared for it""), then gently redirect your focus back to the present moment. It takes practice, but it gets easier over time.

Remember, you deserve to enjoy your downtime without your brain being on constant alert for what's next.","

Speaking to yourself in a gentle, nurturing way - almost like you're comforting a friend - can help activate your body's self-soothing response.

There's even research showing that using your own name or third-person language (""You're safe, [name]"" vs ""I'm safe"") can help create mental distance from the intense emotions and make self-soothing more effective. It's like becoming your own supportive friend or parent in that moment.

Some phrases I use:
- ""[Name], you're having a panic attack. This will pass.""
- ""You're safe right now. Just breathe.""
- ""This feeling is temporary. You've gotten through this before.""

Don't feel weird about it - it's a totally valid way to help yourself through tough moments. Combined with deep breathing and grounding techniques, self-talk can be a powerful tool for managing panic attacks.","

w1aam7,Anxiety,What are the weirdest physical symptoms that anxiety has given you?,cratera666,I'm just curious. I think I'm currently having some weird stuff with my vision lol.,485,732,1658072639,"I feel like I can‚Äôt take a full breath. There‚Äôs like a catch when I try and I can never quite make it.

Edit: Wow did not expect this many people to relate. It‚Äôs kind of nice to know I‚Äôm not alone in this but on the other hand I‚Äôm sorry so many people experience it too",581,princesssconsuelaa,I think hair loss,23,plzhelp9118,"Anxiety can cause so many bizarre physical symptoms that doctors don't always warn you about! I've personally experienced vision changes during anxiety episodes - like things looking slightly ""unreal"" or getting random floaters. It's actually pretty common because anxiety can affect your pupil dilation and muscle tension around your eyes.

Some other weird anxiety symptoms I've dealt with:
- Random muscle twitches/spasms
- Feeling like I can't swallow properly
- Tingling/numbness in hands and feet
- Ringing in ears
- Feeling like I'm swaying even when sitting still

The important thing to remember is that while these symptoms feel scary, they're typically harmless manifestations of anxiety. Your body is in ""fight or flight"" mode and going a bit haywire with the physical responses.

Of course, it's always good to mention new symptoms to your doctor just to rule out other causes. But try not to spiral worrying about them - that only makes anxiety worse. Deep breathing exercises and reminding yourself ""this is just anxiety"" can help break the cycle.

Hang in there! You're not alone in experiencing the weird physical effects of anxiety.","

bknhwo,Anxiety,Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,Humble_Narcissist_00,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older.",1028,189,1556990767,"I‚Äôve been anxious since puberty. Middle school, around the time I got my period I started becoming really quite and started obsessing over things. High school it turned into anxiety about grades and responsibilities, and now in college it‚Äôs everything but I‚Äôm on meds and seeing a therapist so I guess that‚Äôs good lol. I also notice it gets really bad around my time of the month. Still trying to convince my doctors of it...",79,annmarieg5,"I‚Äôve been anxious since I was a kid. Honestly I think it started in 1st grade. When I would get a bad grade in class I would feel I had failed and that I was much less than the other students and that has just continued into my adult life. It only struck me like three years ago just how long I‚Äôve been dealing with this bullshit. I remember having full blow anxiety attacks when we had to do Mad Minute Multiplications in 4th grade cause I was scared to be timed and not do as well as everyone else. Also explains why I started therapy at 9... 
but yeah I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs always been with me. I just didn‚Äôt realize what it was until I developed depression at 15. No one told me it could be anxiety, no one thought a little 6 year old could be so scared of failing and being worthless. I had to do my own research and eventually I began to see a therapist again who diagnosed me.",41,derpskerpinkattz,"I can totally relate to this. I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember too - even little things in kindergarten would send me into worry spirals. It's actually more common than you might think to have anxiety from childhood, even if it's not talked about as much.

What's interesting is that childhood anxiety can manifest differently than adult-onset anxiety, which might explain your therapist's reaction. Kids often show it through physical symptoms (stomach aches, avoiding situations) rather than being able to articulate ""I'm anxious.""

Please don't feel alone in this. While getting help later is great, having anxiety since childhood is a very real experience for many of us. Have you considered seeking out a therapist who specializes in childhood-onset anxiety? They might have better insight into your specific experience and could offer more targeted coping strategies.

The good news is that recognizing this pattern is a huge first step. Understanding where our anxiety comes from can really help in learning how to manage it better.","

You're not alone.",14,SeanSchram7326,"Yes, what you're describing is incredibly common with anxiety! The gut-brain connection is very real - our digestive system is super sensitive to stress and anxiety. I personally get the nervous stomach, gas, and digestive issues when my anxiety spikes.

Some things that have helped me:
- Peppermint tea or ginger tea
- Deep breathing exercises, especially focused on the belly
- Avoiding caffeine when anxious (it can make both anxiety and stomach issues worse)
- Small, bland meals during high-anxiety periods
- Probiotics (they can help balance gut health)

If it's becoming a regular issue, you might want to look into ""gut-directed hypnotherapy"" or working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety. Also, don't hesitate to mention these symptoms to your doctor - they can rule out other causes and might have additional suggestions.

You're definitely not alone in this. Anxiety can really mess with our digestive system, but there are ways to manage it. Hang in there!","

I hope it was Mr. Rogers!,15,Zgonzulli,"Hey, you're definitely not pathetic at all! Going to the movies alone is something that makes a lot of people anxious at first, but it's actually really freeing once you get used to it. I love solo movie trips now because you can fully immerse yourself in the film without worrying about anyone else's experience.

The fact that you're pushing through your anxiety and actually doing it is awesome - that takes real courage! And you know what? Starting with a theater far from home is totally valid. Baby steps are still steps forward.

I noticed you mentioned using this to distract from not eating though - I hope you're taking care of yourself. Maybe next time you could make it a proper ""me date"" with some favorite snacks and treats? Solo adventures can be really empowering when they come from a place of self-care rather than avoidance.

Proud of you for taking this step! Hope you enjoyed the movie and maybe even feel a bit more confident about doing it again closer to home next time! üé¨","

It's like wanting to hit a giant reset button on life when everything feels overwhelming, especially the social stuff. I get those moments too.

The fact that you recognize these as temporary urges and don't act on them shows real strength, even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment. Social interactions can be exhausting, and it's totally normal to want to retreat sometimes.

Instead of disappearing completely, maybe try giving yourself permission to take smaller ""breaks"" - like a mental health day off work when you really need it, or setting boundaries around social commitments. It's okay to step back and recharge without completely dropping off the map.

Remember that being ""good at social stuff"" isn't about being perfect - it's about finding a sustainable balance that works for you. Those feelings of wanting to quit are your mind's way of saying you need some self-care.

You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's brave of you to talk about it.","

Risk management & insurance is a solid field too - you've set yourself up well with that choice. The stability of having a job lined up must feel amazing after all this uncertainty.

Your message about not letting anxiety stop you from achieving your goals is so important. Sometimes just getting through the day with anxiety is exhausting, let alone completing a degree. You're proof that it's possible to work through it, even if the path isn't straight or easy.

But here's the thing - your anxiety isn't you. It's like a really loud radio playing over your actual personality. The real you is still in there, even if it feels buried right now. All those interests, quirks, and qualities that make you *you* haven't disappeared; they're just being drowned out.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? It took me a while to take that step, but learning to manage anxiety (even a little bit) can help turn down that ""radio"" so your true self can shine through more. You're not hopeless, and you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.

Have you considered reaching out to your school's counseling services? They can not only provide support but often help mediate with professors and arrange accommodations if needed. Also, many universities have student advocacy offices that can help communicate with faculty when you're going through a difficult time.

You're not alone in this, even though it feels that way right now. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve support and understanding while working through these challenges. Don't let one professor's insensitive response stop you from seeking help when you need it.","

I'm one of those teenagers who is now grown with a home of my own. There's a guy working on my roof and I've been in hiding all morning. 

  I can't let my dogs outside yet or they will bark and draw attention to me. I can't go too close to the windows or he will see me. I can't watch TV or play music or he will know I'm here. I have to tiptoe around my house so it seems like no one is home.

Here's what helps me: I remind myself that these workers see dozens of homeowners every week - they're focused on their job, not judging you. They probably prefer when homeowners just go about their day normally rather than tiptoeing around. 

Maybe try starting small - let yourself walk past a window, or let the dogs out briefly. The initial interaction (even just a quick wave) usually breaks that tension. And remember, you're literally paying this person to be there - you have every right to exist comfortably in your space!

I also have emetophobia (fear of vomiting), so I know exactly how scary these moments can be when your stomach feels off.

You're already doing some great things with the ginger tea and heating pad. Those are perfect for settling your stomach. Something that helps me is remembering that anxiety itself can cause nausea, stomach cramps, and digestive issues without actually leading to vomiting. It's a frustrating cycle where we feel anxious, which upsets our stomach, which makes us more anxious.

Some things that help me:
- Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 method works well)
- Sipping ice water slowly
- Light stretching
- Focusing on something engaging (podcast, game, etc.)

Remember that this feeling will pass. You're safe, and what you're experiencing is your body's natural response to anxiety. Keep doing what you're doing, and try to be gentle with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Any time I have any sort of confrontational message exchange, I refuse to open the damn thing.

Anxiety is a bitch.

",122,mimiforu,Did you provide evidence to back up your claim that the phone if faulty? Surely the seller wouldn't say such things if it is under warranty.,3,LagoonPatrol,"I totally get this - that anxious feeling of having an important email sitting there unopened. It's like Schr√∂dinger's email - both good and bad news until you actually look at it! 

But here's the thing: you're absolutely in the right here. You did your research, know your consumer rights under EU law, and approached this professionally. That's actually really impressive! Companies often count on people not knowing their rights or being too intimidated to push back.

Try reframing this - you're not being difficult, you're being an informed consumer standing up for your legitimate rights. The worst they can do is say no again, in which case you can escalate to consumer protection authorities.

Maybe set yourself a specific time to open it (like ""I'll check it at 2pm with a cup of coffee""), so you're mentally prepared. Remember, this is just business - they're not judging you personally, and you have nothing to feel bad about.

Would love to hear how it turns out when you do open it! üí™","

My weight is constantly in flux because of this . If I didn‚Äôt smoke weed I don‚Äôt think I would eat at all,127,Flunk_Waffle,"I totally get this - it's such a frustrating cycle. When my anxiety is high, my appetite completely vanishes, and then worrying about not eating enough just makes the anxiety worse. It's like a feedback loop that's really hard to break out of.

Something that's helped me is starting really small - like having meal replacement shakes or smoothies when solid food feels impossible. They're easier to get down and at least provide some nutrients. Also, setting phone reminders to try eating tiny portions throughout the day, even if it's just a few bites of something bland like crackers or toast.

Please be gentle with yourself right now. You're not alone in this struggle and it's completely understandable given what you're going through. If this continues, consider reaching out to your doctor or a counselor - they can help address both the anxiety and eating challenges together.

Sending you support. This won't last forever, even though it feels overwhelming right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

i17eou,Anxiety,Does anyone else find it hard to read books when you have anxiety?,Professional_Kiwi,"It takes me ages to get through a book because my anxiety gets really bad when I read. It's bad very often, so yeah...",1083,123,1596201691,Yes. It can definitely make it much harder for me to focus on anything other than what‚Äôs making me anxious. And it‚Äôs even worse when there‚Äôs no clear reason WHY I‚Äôm anxious.,259,Missab4000,"I wonder if reading a book about how to deal with anxiety might help? If I could recommend one, The Worry Trap.",2,ARomaningCatholic,"I totally get this. When anxiety is high, it's like your mind keeps wandering off the page and getting caught in worry loops instead of following the story. I've found that reading becomes almost impossible when my anxiety is really ramped up - the words are there but they just don't sink in.

Something that's helped me is starting with shorter reading sessions (like 10-15 minutes) when I'm anxious, and gradually building up as I feel more comfortable. Audiobooks can also be a nice alternative since you can do something calming with your hands (like coloring or taking a walk) while listening.

Don't beat yourself up about reading slowly - it's a completely normal response to anxiety. Some days will be better than others, and that's okay. The book isn't going anywhere, and there's no race to finish it.

Have you tried reading different genres when you're anxious? I've found that light, familiar reads tend to work better for me during those times compared to complex or heavy material.","

I read up on it haha,-16,WantedOrNot,"I hear you. That crushing weight of caring too much, of feeling everything so intensely - it's exhausting. And sometimes it feels like everyone else got some manual for how to just breeze through life unbothered while we're here carrying the emotional equivalent of a backpack full of rocks.

But you know what? That sensitivity and ability to care deeply, even though it hurts sometimes, is also what makes you human. It's what allows people to form real connections and create meaningful change in the world.

Instead of trying to shut it all off completely, maybe we can work on finding a healthy middle ground? Learning to care selectively, setting boundaries, and practicing self-preservation without completely numbing ourselves. It's okay to take breaks from caring when it gets overwhelming. It's okay to put yourself first sometimes.

Have you considered talking to someone professional about these feelings? They can help provide tools to manage the emotional weight without losing your essence in the process.

Just know you're not alone in feeling this way. Many of us wish for that magic pill sometimes.","

kzo87a,Anxiety,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,nojox,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards. Replying will take time. Y'all know how it goes - up and down, excited, scared, happy, sad, the full range in an hour!",1110,96,1610948244,I have made this into my desktop wallpaper cuz shit I need to read this everyday,67,ambitchous_13,"Wow, i'm gonna have to read this every morning. I really needed something like this at the moment. Thank You!",2,CannibalMX,"This is such a powerful reframing of anxiety. As someone who has dealt with anxiety, the distinction between ""simulation"" and reality really hits home. Our brains are incredible at creating elaborate ""what-if"" scenarios that feel completely real in the moment.

I especially appreciate your point about fear defeating its own purpose when it becomes paralyzing. That's such a helpful way to challenge anxious thoughts - asking ""Is this fear actually protecting me, or is it holding me back?""

The mantra ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"" is brilliant because it acknowledges both reality and our current limitations. It doesn't dismiss our feelings but helps put them in perspective.

One thing I'd add is that when we recognize anxiety as a simulation, it becomes easier to be compassionate with ourselves. We're not ""broken"" or ""weak"" - we're just experiencing our brain's overactive protection system.

Thank you for sharing this. It's a really valuable framework for anyone struggling with anxiety.","

It's like living in a constant state of ""waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" even when there is no other shoe. Your brain is stuck in survival mode, always scanning for threats that aren't really there.

What helped me understand this better was learning that anxiety often tricks us into thinking we're in a temporary crisis that we just need to ""get through."" But as you've realized, it's the anxiety itself creating that feeling, not actual circumstances.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can teach you specific techniques to help your nervous system recognize when it's unnecessarily in ""fight or flight"" mode. In the meantime, simply acknowledging that this is anxiety playing tricks on you (like you're doing now) is actually a really important first step.

You're right - it is exhausting living this way. But you don't have to figure this out alone, and it can get better with the right support and tools. Sending you strength. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I feel guilty.,242,NaturoHope,,0,,"Hey there - I totally get where you're coming from. As someone who also tends to prefer smaller social circles and quiet time, quarantine has honestly been a relief in some ways. It's completely normal to enjoy solitude and not feel the urgent need to jump back into social activities just because restrictions are lifting.

That said, if your anxiety about the fire gathering is really intense, it's okay to sit this one out. Maybe talk to your boyfriend about how you're feeling? You could suggest starting smaller, like having just 1-2 people over sometime when you're feeling more up to it.

Don't feel guilty about being an introvert or needing more time to adjust. Everyone's different - some people are climbing the walls to socialize while others (like you and me) are perfectly content with less social interaction. There's nothing wrong with either preference.

Just keep checking in with yourself about whether your desire for solitude feels healthy and comfortable versus avoidant. As long as you're generally happy and maintaining the relationships that matter most to you, you're doing just fine.","

- Going for a quick run or doing jumping jacks
- Screaming into said pillow
- Taking 10 deep breaths (seriously, it helps)

The gut-brain connection is really strong, and anxiety can wreak havoc on your digestive system. It's actually so common there's even a term for it - ""nervous stomach.""

Some things that have helped me manage this:
- Deep breathing exercises when you feel anxiety coming on
- Peppermint tea (it's really soothing for the gut)
- Avoiding caffeine when anxious (it can make both anxiety and stomach issues worse)
- Using a heating pad on your stomach
- Following a ""BRAT"" diet during flare-ups (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast)

If it's happening frequently, you might want to talk to your doctor about it. Sometimes they can recommend specific anti-anxiety techniques or medications that won't upset your stomach further.

Just remember that while it's super uncomfortable, it's not dangerous and you're not weird for experiencing this. Our bodies just have different ways of expressing stress, and this happens to be one of yours!","

You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it.

The key is to be gentle with ourselves while not letting one tough day turn into a week. Tomorrow is always a fresh start. Maybe we can't tackle everything on our to-do list, but we can do one small thing - make the bed, take a 5-minute walk, or drink a glass of water.

You're absolutely right that being here shows we want to improve. That counts for something, even on the days when anxiety has us hiding under the covers. Here's to being kind to ourselves while slowly building better days ahead.","

As someone who knows how paralyzing anxiety can be, I'm genuinely inspired by how you pushed through it to not only run, but to handle your entire campaign solo. That's seriously impressive.

The fact that you did all the grunt work yourself - from designing flyers to stuffing envelopes - shows exactly the kind of dedicated, hands-on leadership your community needs. At 26, you're also bringing a fresh perspective that's often missing in local government.

One piece of advice: Document your journey, including the challenges and victories. Your story could inspire other young people (especially those dealing with anxiety) to pursue local leadership roles. We need more representatives who understand what it's like to overcome these kinds of personal battles.

You've already proven you have the drive and capability. Trust those qualities as you move forward into serving your community. Again, huge congratulations!","

POST TITLE: I was just elected to City Council tonight.

POST BODY: Hey all. I‚Äôm 26 years old (F) and decided to run for City Council in the spring of this year. After making it through the primary, I worked on my campaigning all myself. Made my flyer, bought the list of registered voters from the city, bought all postage, folded them, and mailed them all out.

Tonight is a win for all of us. It‚Äôs proof that we can get over these mental barriers from anxiety  if we let ourselves. It‚Äôs a hard fight, but tonight more than one battle was won.

I hear you, and it's completely valid to not be okay right now. You're right that this feeling will pass, and it's wise of you to recognize that you just need to ride it out.

If you ever do want to talk more specifically about what's going on, this community is here to listen without judgment. No pressure though - sometimes we just need to acknowledge our struggles out loud without necessarily wanting solutions or advice.

Take care of yourself during this rough patch. Even small things like staying hydrated or getting some fresh air can help ground you while you're weathering this storm. You're stronger than you probably feel right now, and it's okay to not be okay.

Sending you good thoughts. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I think about how much I hate my day to day to be dreading it so much and re-evaluate my life and get even more depressed. Best just to go back to the grind so I'm too busy/tired to think.,27,TRIGMILLION,"I totally get this - the Sunday Scaries are very real and it sounds like yours are particularly intense. I've dealt with similar anxiety and physical symptoms, though maybe not quite as severe.

A few things that have helped me:
- Planning something enjoyable for Sunday evenings to reframe it (I do a weekly movie night with snacks)
- Getting organized for Monday on Friday afternoon so Sunday isn't filled with prep stress
- Light exercise or a walk during the day to burn off anxious energy
- Simple meditation/breathing exercises when the anxiety starts ramping up
- Setting a strict ""no work email"" boundary on weekends

Also, given the intensity of your symptoms, it might be worth talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety. There's no shame in getting professional support, and they can teach you specific coping techniques for your situation.

Remember you're not alone in this - tons of people struggle with Sunday anxiety. Be gentle with yourself and try to build some positive Sunday routines that work for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

9xm7w6,Anxiety,"I bought myself tickets to a concert about two months ago just for myself. I forgot about it until this week, but I‚Äôve been really excited about it! Every single day, I‚Äôve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. I‚Äôm not even worried I‚Äôm going by myself.",lamy0720,"Edit: Friends, I made it! I got dressed up, made it to the venue, and I‚Äôm here! ",1087,110,1542375437,Excellent! Who are you going to see?,52,buttw0rm,"WELL I didnt make it to a stage on my own. BUT I danced and not next to the people I went with I went and stood further up on my own.. a little bit.. lol. It was a Trance Festival and everyone at Trance shows make me feel very comfortable. They are all so happy and Friendly. Easing myself into it. 

Ill leave you with this crazyness. And thank you a ton 

 Ive been having a reoccurring dream about going to the beach.. and I never get there. I can see the beach but something always happens keeping me from going to the beach. I like to dissect dreams... but I left this one alone because In reality.. ive been wanting to visit a real beach for a long time. I haven't been in years. So I though it was just a desire. 

I finally took the dream apart after I had a weird beach dream.. I found the beach in this dream and I fell to my knees to feel the sand and the sand turned into brown carpet. So i lifted up the carpet to look for the sand and there was another layer of carpet, I kept lifting up the layers of carpet (there were 3) and then there was this hole or window or something Where i could see the real beach and I became very upset because there were so many people on the beach that there was no place for me to sit and enjoy the peace and serenity. 

Anyway the dream ended up up being completely symbolic. The Beach is a Symbolic for the meeting place between my rational self (the Sand) and my emotional self (the water). The carpet was symbolic for the harsh realities of my life, the carpet being brown and dirty was symbolic for the foundation or comfort zone I have laid out for myself is no longer working for me and that I am refusing to confront issues in my life. Peeling up Carpet was symbolic that the way i view the world will be drastically changed and will specifically challenge my comfort zone. 

The sea specifically is symbolic for Emotional turbulence in my life and the everything that I worry about will resolve itself I overwhelm myself with my own emotions.. So I could see the resolution in my dreams.. but in this one.. the only thing keeping me from reaching that was all of the people I didnt want to be around. 
And what hit home for me here.. was the symbol of a crowded beach, It means that I seek company and a social life. It is the bridge that I need to cross to find the ocean.. My peace.. the meeting place between my rational and emotional mind. 
I am aware that Socializing is healthy.. and I used to at least try. Until I turned about 22 years old.. I spent the next two years avoiding people like the plague. Which is sad for me.. because I enjoy helping people, even if its out of blunt honesty and tons of people say I make them feel so good and happy Like I am a light in the dark.. but I just get so overwhelmed around them all. When I am not helping with problems..I dont know what to say. Advise comes easily out of my mouth.. but regular conversation.... no. there is no dictionary in my mind for that. 

Any way I thought it was a bit synchronistic that I was talking to you about trying to be social and then also got the message from my dream that Its time for me to try again. So thank you for contributing to that. 
",1,s0nder369thOughts,"That's awesome! Going to concerts solo can be such a liberating experience - you get to fully immerse yourself in the music without worrying about whether your companions are having fun or trying to coordinate meetup spots. Plus, you can dance however you want without feeling self-conscious!

I've done several solo concerts and honestly sometimes prefer them now. There's something really empowering about doing things by yourself and realizing you can have an amazing time on your own terms.

Love that you got dressed up for it too! That's the perfect way to make it feel special and celebratory. Hope you had an incredible time and made some great memories. Don't forget to save your ticket stub if you like keeping mementos! 

Would love to hear how it went and what the highlight of the show was for you. Solo adventures like this often end up being some of our favorite stories to look back on.","

Or sometimes, I sleep while The Office runs in the background.",40,pearl_sparkle,"Yes, this is absolutely normal! Physical symptoms from anxiety can definitely linger for hours after the initial trigger. What you're experiencing is basically your body's stress response system still being ""activated"" - especially with caffeine in the mix, which can amplify those physical symptoms.

Something that really helps me in these situations is focused deep breathing (4 counts in, hold for 4, 4 counts out) and progressive muscle relaxation - tensing and releasing each muscle group from your toes up to your face. It helps signal to your body that it's safe to calm down.

Also, try not to get anxious about being anxious (I know, easier said than done). Remember that these physical symptoms, while uncomfortable, are temporary and not dangerous. Your body is just taking a bit longer to return to baseline.

If this happens regularly, you might want to track your caffeine intake and anxiety patterns. Sometimes cutting back on caffeine or not having it after a certain time can make a big difference.

Hang in there - this will pass! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

A lot of people feel nervous about it, so you should be proud of yourself for giving it a try.

Don't worry too much about having trouble with the ordering part. That's totally normal, especially the first time. Even regular solo diners can feel a bit awkward sometimes! If it helps, you can always look at the menu online beforehand to feel more prepared next time.

The most important thing is that you did it, and it went ""ok"" overall. Each time you do it, it'll get easier and more comfortable. Plus, there's something really freeing about being able to enjoy a meal by yourself - you can take your time, people-watch, or just enjoy your food without worrying about making conversation.

Keep at it! Maybe next time bring a book or your phone if you want something to do, or just embrace the solo dining experience. You've already gotten past the hardest part - the first time.","

It's brutal and you're definitely not alone in this.

Something that's helped me break through this is the ""5-minute rule."" Tell yourself you only have to work on the assignment for 5 minutes. That's it. Usually the hardest part is just starting, and once you get going for those few minutes, it becomes easier to continue.

Also, please reach out to your school's counseling services if you haven't already. Many students deal with academic anxiety and they can provide strategies and support. Your professors might also be more understanding than you think if you're upfront about your struggles.

Don't beat yourself up over this. Anxiety is a real challenge and it's not your fault. Take it one small step at a time - even opening your assignment document counts as progress. You've got this, and there's always a way forward, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.","

I was misdiagnosed for years until I was properly put on the right medication and these thoughts went away. Talk to your doctor because obsessing over thoughts from years ago isn‚Äôt a common thing in anxiety disorder. Please talk to your doctor.",187,[deleted],,0,,"I know exactly what you mean - that mental replay loop can be exhausting. I used to (and sometimes still do) lie awake at night cringing at something minor I said THREE DAYS ago that the other person probably forgot about 30 seconds after our conversation.

Something that really helped me was realizing that everyone else is way too focused on their own ""highlight reel of embarrassing moments"" to remember our small social fumbles. Think about it - can you easily recall awkward things your friends or coworkers said last week? Probably not, because we're all mainly focused on ourselves.

Try to catch yourself when you start that spiral of over-analysis. Ask yourself: ""Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?"" Usually the answer is no. And remember that those little imperfect moments in conversation are what make us human and relatable. Perfect, rehearsed interactions would actually be pretty weird and robotic.

You're definitely not alone in this. It's a super common form of social anxiety that many of us deal with. Be gentle with yourself! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Here's what helps me: When I catch myself thinking ""everyone hates me,"" I try to flip it and think about how I view others. Do I hate people who are a bit awkward sometimes? Do I resent quiet people at social gatherings? Do I judge others as harshly as I judge myself? The answer is almost always no. Most people are way too focused on their own lives to scrutinize us the way anxiety tells us they do.

You're showing incredible empathy by wanting to help others see past their anxiety while struggling with it yourself.

Would you mind sharing what techniques worked for you? It might help others who are struggling with similar challenges. For me, focusing on slow breathing and grounding exercises (like naming 5 things I can see, 4 I can touch, etc.) has been helpful.

Each time you successfully manage an attack, you're building confidence and proving to yourself that you have more control than your anxiety wants you to believe. It's like building a muscle - it gets stronger with practice.

Bringing awareness to it and slowing it down really made a difference for me.",93,lorennsiena,,0,,"I totally relate to this feeling - it's like being stuck in ""fast forward"" mode even when there's no real deadline or pressure. What you're describing sounds a lot like anxiety manifesting as an urge to ""complete"" things just to get them over with, rather than actually being busy or having somewhere to be.

Have you tried mindfulness techniques? I know it sounds clich√©, but deliberately practicing being present in the moment - even for just 5 minutes at a time - can help break that constant ""rush to the finish line"" mindset. Start small, like really focusing on the taste of your coffee or the sensation of warm water during a shower.

It might also help to examine why you feel the need to rush back to ""nothing."" Sometimes we use busyness as a way to avoid uncomfortable feelings or thoughts that come up during downtime. Maybe try keeping a simple journal to track when this rushing feeling is strongest and what triggers it.

You're not alone in this - it's a really common experience in our fast-paced world. Be gentle with yourself as you work on finding a better balance.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else feel like they're constantly in a rush to get things done even when they have nothing else they want to do?

POST BODY: I don't know if this is anxiety linked or not but Ive always has this sense to rush things. I always want to get things done and completed, even enjoyable things sometimes. 

Like I want to move on to the next thing or I just want to finish things so I can relax.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc. 

I've read of ""Hurry Sickness"" but it feels like that matches people that are actually busy and want to do more things. Im not really a busy person, it's like I'm in a rush to get back to doing nothing.

quvxse,Anxiety,Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?,NorthernAvo,"I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",1026,158,1637026166,I wrote this post apparently,244,Significant-Custard1,Yep.  Everyday.  But I've experimented enough with other jobs that the pros of going back to do what I was trained for outweighed the cons.,30,Jive_Bob,"I totally get this, and you're not alone. That feeling of your free time being held hostage by work obligations is something many of us struggle with, especially the anxiety about having to force ourselves to sleep early just to function the next day.

What helped me was reframing how I view my evenings. Instead of seeing them as just ""pre-work preparation time,"" I started treating them as MY time that I actively choose to use for self-care. I also implemented a ""worry window"" - 15 minutes where I allow myself to stress about work, then consciously shut those thoughts down outside that window.

The anxiety about those ""hell days"" is rough, but remember - you've survived every tough day so far. When those thoughts creep in during your off time, try to acknowledge them briefly and then redirect your focus to the present moment.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They might help you develop better tools for managing work-related anxiety and establishing healthier boundaries between your work and personal life. Your feelings are valid, but you deserve to enjoy your free time without work anxiety looming over you.","

What do you think the root of your anxiety comes from?",259,inyoureye696,"Hey, first off - I'm really sorry this happened to you. Panic attacks are already awful enough without adding extra trauma to the mix. But you know what? The body does weird things when we're in fight-or-flight mode, and loss of bowel control is actually pretty common during severe anxiety episodes. It's embarrassing as hell, but it's a legitimate physiological response.

Props to you for being able to laugh about it now. That kind of resilience is exactly what helps us get through the rough patches. If it helps, I've heard plenty of similar stories from others who've had panic attacks - you're definitely not alone in this experience.

Have you talked to your doctor about your panic attacks? Sometimes adjusting medication timing or trying different management techniques can help prevent attacks from getting this intense. Either way, you handled a really tough situation and came out the other side with your sense of humor intact. That's a win in my book.

Stay strong, and don't let this discourage you. We're all just humans dealing with our weird brains and bodies the best we can. üí™","

I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I‚Äôve been feeling. I hate that I‚Äôm afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship when he‚Äôs only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can‚Äôt hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai‚Äôi (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. And it doesn‚Äôt help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don‚Äôt follow.

Christ it's a nightmare I'm with you though OP.,49,Arminlegout1,[deleted],1,[deleted],"I feel this so deeply. That constant anxiety and hypervigilance is absolutely exhausting, especially when you're trying so hard to protect your family but can't control everyone's choices. Living in a tourist area during COVID must be especially stressful - I can't imagine the frustration of watching visitors potentially putting your community at risk.

It's totally valid to feel drained and scared while also being grateful for what you have. Those feelings can coexist. And your safety precautions aren't silly at all - you're doing what helps you cope with an incredibly difficult situation.

One small suggestion that helped me: Try to carve out small ""anxiety-free zones"" in your day, even if it's just 15 minutes of watching something funny or doing something that fully absorbs your attention. It won't fix everything, but it can help create little mental breaks from the constant stress.

Sending you lots of aloha. This won't last forever, even though it feels that way right now. Keep taking care of yourself and your ohana as best you can. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

dyfwbm,Anxiety,Hadn‚Äôt Left the house in four years update.,c3p0n0,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.",1095,85,1574140229,"This is incredible! It's great that you've been able to rebuild your life after your breakdown.

Taking that first step to call NAMI must have been terrifying, but look at how far you've come! From being unable to check the mail to driving on the freeway and reconnecting with friends - that's remarkable progress.

What really stands out is how you tackled this systematically - starting with telehealth therapy, gradually working up your medication, and then pushing your comfort zone bit by bit. That Home Depot trip was a huge milestone, and I love that you celebrated it! 

The most powerful part of your story is how you're rebuilding those connections with your children and finding your sense of value again. Mental health struggles can make us feel so worthless, but you've proven that there's always hope for recovery.

Thank you for sharing this. Your journey shows that while recovery isn't linear and takes time, it's absolutely possible with the right support and persistent small steps forward. You're living proof that it's never too late to ask for help and start healing.","

Tiny home, acres of land, nobody around for miles. String retro lights above a rooftop deck and listen to nothing but the wind and trees swaying and the sound of birds in the trees.

Sometimes the constant noise of modern life - social media, work stress, endless obligations - makes me dream about just... disappearing into the woods with some books and a coffee maker.

But here's the thing - while the hermit fantasy is super appealing, most of us probably wouldn't be happy with complete isolation long-term. Humans are social creatures, even us introverts. Maybe what we're really craving is a better balance?

You could try incorporating ""hermit-like"" elements into your current life: regular digital detoxes, solo camping weekends, a dedicated quiet space at home, or even just blocking off ""do not disturb"" time where you're completely unreachable. These mini-escapes can help scratch that isolation itch without completely checking out of society.

That said, if you're seriously considering the cabin life, there are people who make it work! Check out r/homesteading or r/OffGrid for some realistic perspectives on what it takes. Just remember - even Thoreau had visitors at Walden Pond.","

I especially appreciate point #1 about our stress hormones creating a ""neurophysiological illusion"" - it's so easy to forget that our anxious thoughts aren't always reflecting reality.

I've found that treating these moments like a temporary storm really helps. Just like how weather passes, these intense feelings will pass too. The breathing tip is crucial - it's amazing how something as simple as deep breathing can help break that anxiety feedback loop.

One thing I'd add to this list is grounding exercises. When I'm spiraling, I use the 5-4-3-2-1 method: naming 5 things I can see, 4 I can touch, 3 I can hear, 2 I can smell, and 1 I can taste. It helps bring me back to the present moment when my mind is running wild with ""what-ifs.""

Thanks for sharing this - it's a great toolkit for those tough moments we all face. Saving this for my next anxiety spiral!","

4. Let out a deep bellylaugh at all this non-sense.

You've captured something really profound about depression - how it warps our perception of reality and makes everything feel impossibly heavy. I especially appreciate what you said about not wanting to die, but wanting the pain to stop. That's such an important distinction that many people don't understand.

Your message about hope and persistence really resonates with me. I've been in that dark place too, where even basic things like enjoying music or being interested in conversations felt impossible. But you're absolutely right - recovery isn't linear, but it does happen. We keep growing even when we can't feel it happening.

The way you described that moment of realization - looking back and seeing how far you've come - brought tears to my eyes. It's such a powerful milestone in recovery. For anyone reading this who's still in that pit: hold onto these words. The person you are when you're depressed isn't the real you. It's the depression talking, and it lies. Keep going. Keep fighting. You're stronger than you know.","

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how huge of an accomplishment this is. Job interviews are stressful enough without having to manage panic attacks, so you should be really proud of yourself for getting through it successfully.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with using medication to help manage anxiety - that's exactly what it's there for. You used the tools available to you and crushed it! The fact that your interviewer seemed to like you is a great sign too.

Try to hold onto this victory regardless of the outcome. Even if this particular job doesn't work out, you've proven to yourself that you CAN do interviews and handle them well. That's valuable experience and confidence you can take into future opportunities.

Fingers crossed for good news! ü§û","

If you ever catch yourself rethinking something humiliating you did, stop and instead try to remember something embarrassing someone else did.

I've found it super helpful to remind myself that most people are way too focused on their own embarrassing moments to remember mine. We tend to be our own worst critics.

Another tip that's helped me: When those cringy memories pop up, try to look at them with self-compassion. Like, would you judge a friend that harshly for the same thing? Probably not. Plus, the fact that you're cringing means you've grown as a person - you can recognize now why it was awkward, which shows personal growth!

I used to obsess over this one time I called my teacher ""mom"" in high school. Years later, I realized she probably dealt with that multiple times per year and forgot about it 5 minutes later. Most of our ""huge"" embarrassing moments are just tiny blips in other people's days.

Thanks for sharing this perspective - it's a great reminder that we're all human and nobody's keeping a spreadsheet of our awkward moments! üòä","

Each successful interaction or presentation becomes evidence that you CAN do this, even if it feels scary at first.

That ""what was I thinking beforehand?"" moment is pure gold. Try to remember this feeling next time anxiety creeps in before a presentation. You've now got solid proof that you can handle speaking to 80 people - that's huge!

That anxious purgatory between being ready and actually needing to leave is weirdly stressful, even when you have no real reason to be stressed. It's like your brain goes into ""waiting mode"" and suddenly every minute feels like an eternity.

What helps me is having a few ""time-filler"" activities specifically for these moments. I keep a book by the door, have a few quick phone games I only play during wait times, or use those extra minutes to do small tasks like watering plants or tidying up. The key is picking activities that have a clear stopping point so you don't risk getting too absorbed and running late.

Also, maybe try working backwards from your leave time and building in a bit more buffer in your morning routine? Sometimes spreading out the getting-ready process helps avoid that anxious clustering of time at the end.

But yeah, you're definitely not alone in this! It's a weirdly common form of anxiety that nobody really talks about.","

It's like your mind goes ""Hey, remember that awkward thing you said at that meeting 3 years ago? Let's replay that 50 times!""

What helps me is remembering that other people are usually too focused on their own embarrassing moments to remember yours. Plus, those cringe-worthy memories often mean you've grown as a person - you only find them embarrassing because you've learned and changed since then.

Try to be kind to yourself when these thoughts pop up. I sometimes say to myself ""Yeah, that was awkward, but it's done and I'm a different person now."" Or try to redirect your thoughts by focusing on something in the present moment - what you can see, hear, or touch right now.

Just remember that having these thoughts is super normal and human. We all have our highlight reel of awkward moments - it's part of the shared human experience!","

lrhd7x,Anxiety,I no longer have suicidal thoughts,Kenny_K-Man,"Well actually I haven‚Äôt had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a ‚ÄúI want to die.‚Äù But I realize that I can‚Äôt kill myself, because I can‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs not in me, it‚Äôs in my head but it doesn‚Äôt tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can‚Äôt even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it‚Äôs not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I‚Äôm a coward, I couldn‚Äôt end the pain of living so I have to live like you‚Äôre half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn‚Äôt cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell.

Your friend is absolutely right - continuing to push forward despite everything life has thrown at you isn't cowardice, it's incredible strength. Every day you choose to stay here, even when it's hard, is an act of courage.

I love that you're starting to see things differently. That smile in the dark? That's huge. It's these small moments that start adding up and slowly help us heal. Reading a book sounds like a great idea too - sometimes just doing normal, everyday things can help ground us when life feels overwhelming.

You mentioned you're ""crawling but moving slowly"" - that's perfectly okay. Progress isn't always about big leaps forward. Sometimes it's just about taking the next breath, getting through the next hour, finding one tiny thing to smile about.

Keep going, keep breathing, keep finding those small moments of light. You're doing better than you think you are. And if you ever need support, there are people and resources here to help you take those next steps forward.","

As a mom, I feel I need to be strong and I need to vaccinate myself to limit the spread.

You may not have any symptoms at all.  If you do have symptoms, you'll get through them in the moment, instead of anticipating the worst.  You may experience profound relief at finally being in it instead of having to think about the imminent experience of being in it.

As someone who also deals with health anxiety, I know how scary medical decisions can be - especially as a mom when you're trying to do what's best for both yourself and your family.

Remember that billions of people worldwide have safely received COVID vaccines. The temporary side effects (if you get any) are usually mild and go away within a day or two. Having your phone handy with some calming apps, favorite shows, or music can help distract you if anxiety starts creeping in during the waiting period after the shot.

You're being incredibly brave by facing your fears and taking this important step to protect yourself and others. That's what good parenting looks like - sometimes we have to do hard things because they're the right things.

Consider letting the vaccination staff know you're anxious - they're used to helping nervous patients and can talk you through everything. You've got this, and you're going to feel so relieved once it's done! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

fv6vhu,Anxiety,Corona killed my anxiety,meowie91,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.

It's like you've finally been given permission to live at a pace that actually works for your mind and body.

While this situation won't last forever, maybe use this time to really understand what elements are helping you thrive - whether it's the extra sleep, private bathroom access for IBS management, or more downtime for recharging. When things return to ""normal,"" you might be able to negotiate some permanent WFH days or set better boundaries around social commitments.

POST TITLE: Corona killed my anxiety

POST BODY: Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  

Appreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.  I got lucky because I have a very stable job and its just my husband and I at home.

I think having to struggle with something internal like anxiety every day gives someone a more empathetic perspective on other people‚Äôs situations. Rather than advising OPs to overcome their external circumstances, people on here give them the support to manage their internal struggles because change isn‚Äôt possible without addressing that.

This sub is fantastic.,115,EngragedOrphan,"Not sure if you‚Äôre into video games, but if so, I highly recommend Stardew valley and the Stardew valley sub. It‚Äôs also a very supportive community and the game it‚Äôs self has helped me calm my nervous system down when it‚Äôs at its worst.",20,Goatmebro69,"I couldn't agree more with your observation. There's something uniquely powerful about a community where everyone truly ""gets it."" When you're dealing with anxiety, sometimes you don't need someone to fix your problems - you need someone who understands that just getting through the day can be a victory in itself.

I've noticed that people here tend to validate feelings first before jumping to solutions, which is so important when dealing with anxiety. It's like we've all silently agreed that ""your feelings are real, and they matter"" is step one of any support we offer.

And you're absolutely right about the empathy factor. When you've experienced the weight of anxiety yourself, you develop this sixth sense for recognizing others' struggles and knowing exactly what kind of support they might need in that moment.

Thank you for this post - it's a beautiful reminder that while anxiety might be what brought us all here, it's our shared humanity and understanding that keeps this community strong. Here's to continuing to support each other through 2024 and beyond. üíú","

That anxiety about calling out is so real, even when you're legitimately sick. I used to force myself to go in while dealing with similar situations and honestly? It just made everything worse - both for my health and my actual productivity.

Here's what helped me shift my perspective: If you're that sick, you're not actually being a ""good employee"" by showing up. You're not performing well, you might get others sick, and you're prolonging your own recovery. A good boss should want their employees to take care of themselves because healthy workers are productive workers.

Try to remind yourself that sick days exist for exactly this reason. You're not slacking - you're using a benefit that's literally part of your job. Maybe practice what you'll say beforehand to reduce anxiety (""I'm dealing with a stomach illness and need to take a sick day to recover"").

Take care of yourself first. The guilt is understandable but remember - you wouldn't judge a coworker for calling out when they're genuinely ill, right? Give yourself the same grace.","

I've struggled with anxiety for over a decade, and coming to terms with it being a long-term part of my life was really hard at first. But I want to offer a slightly different perspective that helped me:

Think of anxiety like bad eyesight - it's a condition we have to manage, but it doesn't define us. Just like glasses help us see clearly, our coping tools help us navigate life. And while we'll always need those tools, we get better at using them over time.

The good news is that even though anxiety doesn't completely disappear, it often becomes much more manageable than it feels right now. The ""always being in your head"" part can actually become less intense and frequent as you develop better coping strategies. I've found that some days I barely notice it, while other days are harder - and that's okay.

You're right that it's exhausting, and it's totally valid to feel frustrated about this. But please know you're not alone in this struggle, and it doesn't have to be as overwhelming as it feels right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how life-changing it can be to find a grounding technique that actually works for you.

Another variation you might find helpful is the 5-4-3-2-1 method: 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. Having both techniques in your ""anxiety toolkit"" can be super useful since different methods might work better in different situations.

I totally get how overwhelming anxiety can be, especially during big life changes like moving and HRT. It's awesome that you found something that helps you regain control so quickly.

One thing that's helped me is building my own support network gradually - through online communities, support groups, or even just one understanding person at a time. Sometimes the family we choose can be more supportive than the one we're born into.

It's also important to remember that seeking professional help isn't a sign of weakness - therapists can provide that consistent emotional support that we might be missing elsewhere.

I've experienced this too - it's like a frustrating loop where you start worrying about getting anxious, which then makes you more anxious. It's actually a really common pattern in anxiety disorders.

Something that helped me understand this better was learning that this is our brain's ""alarm system"" being a bit too sensitive. When you fear the anxiety symptoms themselves, your brain interprets that fear as danger and triggers more anxiety symptoms, creating that cycle.

A few things that might help:
- Remind yourself that anxiety feelings, while uncomfortable, aren't dangerous
- Practice accepting the feelings rather than fighting them (I know, easier said than done)
- Try grounding techniques when you feel it starting (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method)

Remember you're not alone in this. Many of us deal with this exact same pattern, and while it feels overwhelming, it can get better with time and the right support. Have you considered talking to a therapist about this specifically? They can teach you some really helpful techniques for breaking this cycle.","

POST BODY: Take a breath slowly, fully (belly-chest-head), and as comfortably as possible, and let it out the same way. Repeat this for a minute or as long as you need, and you will feel better. Try to smile if you can because it does help a bit. If it's still tight, it helps to hold the tension (safely) on purpose, and then let the tension go as you exhale. For your chest try breathing in fully (belly-chest-head), holding it, and ""squeezing"" the air to your head. After a bit (10 seconds or so) let it go and feel the tension dissipate. You guys deserve this for toughing it out in this crazy time of our lives. You will get through, and here's a ritual to help you out. Whenever you want to dial it back a bit, go through these motions. Here's a virtual hug you guys.

n7nvmq,Anxiety,"Does an ""anxiety hangover"" exist?",Hansolio,"The day after a day and evening full of anxiety I feel like a hangover: brainfog, heavy eyes, tired,... Do you recognise this feeling?",1027,134,1620475701,"Yea unfortunately this happens to me a lot, especially after anxiety/panic attacks. It‚Äôs like my body needs some time to recover from the intensity of that experience. I always try to give myself rest the next day and make sure I get plenty of nutritious food and water.",257,sarahnicole_7,"Yes, I do! Usually it fades in the next day. I don't know how that is for you?",2,kinkyroze,"Yes, ""anxiety hangovers"" are absolutely real! I experience them too and they're exhausting. When you go through intense anxiety, your body releases a ton of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Once the anxiety subsides, your body and brain need time to recover from being in that heightened state - kind of like how your body needs to recover after running a marathon.

Some things that help me with the post-anxiety fatigue:
- Being extra gentle with myself the next day
- Drinking lots of water and eating nourishing foods
- Taking a walk in fresh air if I'm up for it
- Getting some extra rest when possible
- Reminding myself it's normal and temporary

Think of it as your body's natural reset period. You're not being lazy or weak - your nervous system just needs time to bounce back. If these episodes happen frequently, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional about anxiety management strategies. But know you're definitely not alone in experiencing this!","

I‚Äôm so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I‚Äôm just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It‚Äôs amazing and I had a great night. I‚Äôm so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. 


**Update:** **She just asked if I wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, I agreed. But I‚Äôm instantly regretting this. What have I done.**

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She‚Äôs really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You‚Äôre all amazing!**

I move in 3 days from now for my freshman year. Hope everything goes well for the both of us,92,jensreddit12,"This is such a wonderful story and journey to read! As someone who also dealt with social anxiety in college, I totally understand those conflicting feelings - the excitement of making new connections mixed with the fear of somehow messing it up.

Here's something I learned: real friends understand that everyone has different communication styles and comfort levels. The fact that they're making plans with you and hanging out shows they genuinely enjoy your company. Try not to overthink the texting - busy periods are totally normal in college life!

The way you pushed yourself to go to that event, even though it was scary, shows incredible courage. And look at the amazing outcome! You've gone from standing alone at a party to movie nights and weekend plans. That's huge progress.

Keep being yourself and remember that friendship is a natural give-and-take. Sometimes you'll talk more, sometimes less, and that's perfectly okay. You're doing great, and I'm genuinely happy for you! üíú","

The chance of rain triggers my anxiety. The low light levels and air pressure drops make my body shut down. I like gardening and hiking, but I don‚Äôt like being wet because I never have the appropriate clothing and I‚Äôm afraid of my wallet, clothing, and shoes getting mildew and rotting and becoming smelly.",13,CheeseDaver,"Absolutely feel you on this. Rain has this magical way of making everything feel a bit more manageable, especially on those rough days. There's actually some science behind why rain is so calming - the steady sound of raindrops is a form of ""white noise"" that can help reduce anxiety and racing thoughts.

Sorry you're having a rough Monday though. Depression can hit hard out of nowhere sometimes. Your plan to decompress with the rain sounds perfect - maybe add some hot tea and cozy blankets to really lean into that comforting vibe? 

I love setting up near a window when it rains, just watching the droplets and letting my mind settle. There are also some great rain sound playlists on Spotify/YouTube for when you need that peaceful feeling on dry days.

Hope your evening brings you some peace and that tomorrow feels a bit lighter. Take care of yourself today. üåßÔ∏è","

5tm37a,Anxiety,Telling somebody with anxiety to stop worrying is like telling somebody with epilepsy to stop having a seizure.,iWishPizzaWasHealthy,Saw this quote today and it needs to be shared.,1083,75,1486915246,"I have heard this several times before and I just want to say this out loud for once rather than stifle it, let's call it an exercise in fighting my anxiety about how poorly it will be received.

I have epilepsy and anxiety.  I deal with both on a daily basis, they are both powerful beasts that can take similar forms but that are inherently distinctly different.  One key difference is this: anxiety is a cognitive function that can be harnessed and controlled; epilepsy is a biological process that, in most cases, cannot be halted through sheer willpower.  I view it like being trapped in a metal room - with anxiety, the door has heavy resistance and at times seems impossible to open; with epilepsy the same door is locked, barred and spot-welded shut.

Please don't get me wrong, anxiety can be crippling and is a severe widespread problem that should not be treated lightly.  My battles with both have been exhausting, but respectively very different.  These experiences have taught me one extremely important difference between the two:  anxious thoughts *must* must be faced to overcome anxiety, seizures do not have to be faced to overcome epilepsy.


To anyone out there with anxiety - you are not a victim, this sucks but you are not condemned to a life of these attacks/episodes.  You *can* pull yourself out of thought-spirals, overwhelming anxious thought, etc.  Maybe not this moment, maybe not next week or next year, but you can and with enough determination will do it.  Please don't compare yourself as someone who has a condition that can only really be managed with medication, it's not true and not fair to yourselves in your fight against anxiety.

Once again, it is not my intent to cause controversy, rather to vent a bit and clear some misconceptions.  I believe in you all and wish you peace and strength in your battles to come.",212,ElmoNeedsAmmo,"You have a point, but that doesnt mean we should lash out at someone who tells us to stop worrying. It doesnt automatically make them a mental illness denier or anything.. Sometimes having someone there who cares enough to try and assure you that it'll be okay can be enough to feel okay, and it doesn't matter if theyre right or wrong about the dynamics of anxiety. ",19,MrGCar,"This is so accurate. As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I'm tired of people treating it like it's just a choice or something you can ""turn off."" When you're in the grip of anxiety, your brain is literally in fight-or-flight mode - it's a physiological response, not just negative thinking.

What actually helps is having people who understand that anxiety is real and valid, while also gently supporting you in developing healthy coping strategies. Things like therapy, breathing exercises, and medication (if prescribed) can make a huge difference - but telling someone to ""just relax"" or ""stop overthinking"" usually makes things worse because now they're anxious AND feeling guilty about being anxious.

If you want to help someone with anxiety, try saying something like ""I hear you"" or ""That sounds really tough"" instead. Sometimes just having your feelings acknowledged without judgment can help take the edge off.

To anyone dealing with anxiety: Your feelings are valid, and you're not broken. There's help available, and you don't have to figure it all out alone.","

ie3uac,Anxiety,"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.",throwaway06601,"Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on. Thank you to each and every one of you.",1098,59,1598039247,brace yourself. so many good things are coming it will blow your mind,149,Omniscient-Nihilist,brace yourself. so many good things are coming it will blow your mind,149,Omniscient-Nihilist,"I really feel this. That constant state of waiting for the other shoe to drop is exhausting, and it can rob you of enjoying the good moments when they're actually happening. It's like your brain is trying to protect you by always being on guard, but it's actually preventing you from fully living.

What helped me was learning about anxiety's ""false alarm"" system. Our brains evolved to keep us safe, but sometimes they go into overdrive, seeing threats everywhere. When I catch myself catastrophizing, I try to pause and ask ""Is this a real threat I need to address right now, or is my anxiety playing tricks on me?""

You're already doing the right things - seeking medical care, planning to get therapy. While you're waiting to find an in-person therapist, you might find some relief in mindfulness exercises or anxiety workbooks. They're not replacements for therapy, but they can give you tools to help manage these thoughts.

Be gentle with yourself. Living with constant anxiety is really hard, and you're doing your best to handle it.","

As someone who has dealt with panic attacks, I know exactly how overwhelming that fight-or-flight response can be. The fact that you not only stayed put but managed to continue the conversation is a massive achievement.

The water sipping technique you used is actually really smart - it gives you something physical to focus on and helps regulate your breathing. You basically created your own grounding technique in the moment, which is exactly what therapists recommend.

This experience just proved to yourself that you can handle panic attacks without escaping. Each time you face one and get through it, you're literally rewiring your brain to be less afraid of them. That's how exposure therapy works.

8z20x2,Anxiety,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,MightyJoeTYoung,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever?

It's completely okay to take some time to breathe and enjoy this stability you've earned. Having hobbies and a social life isn't being lazy - it's part of a balanced life. That said, your anxiety might be telling you something worth listening to, just not in the urgent way it's presenting itself.

Maybe try this: Instead of feeling pressured to make dramatic changes right now, set aside a little time (maybe one evening a week) to explore what you really want long-term. Research graduate programs casually, network a bit, or look into different career paths. This way you can work toward future goals while still enjoying your current stability.

Remember, life isn't a race. It's okay to move at your own pace and find the right balance between growth and contentment.","

I suffer from anxiety all the time. As I‚Äôve gotten older I try to focus on the anxiety as energy moving throughout my body.  If I have anxiety and I feel it in my stomach, I zone in on how my stomach is feeling, pay attention to the anxiety moving throughout my body and it helps to relieve it eventually, don‚Äôt ignore it as it‚Äôs there for your attention, something about your mental thinking or the physical world is causing this energy to enter your body, find out what it is, pay attention, don‚Äôt ignore it.",1109,44,1555619131,Thank you friend. Needed to read this today.,52,MartialArtsFanboy,I'm a 26 year old male who is having anxiety and panic attacks for the first time in my life and it been a constant panic for the past 6 days. It's because I told my girlfriend I was ok with an open relationship and she went on a trip and she swears all she did was kiss him and I believe her I do. But I don't know what to do about this terrible pain and anxiety my heart feels. Does anyone have any advise for something to read or listen too?,1,Smokeyrainbow,"This is such a powerful perspective on anxiety! I totally relate to that feeling of energy coursing through your body. It's like our ancient fight-or-flight response getting triggered in modern situations. 

What you're describing sounds a lot like mindfulness - observing the physical sensations without judgment. I love how you frame it as energy rather than something inherently negative. When we resist anxiety or try to push it away, it often gets worse. But when we lean into it and get curious about what our body is trying to tell us, it can actually become more manageable.

I've found that combining this awareness with deep breathing helps channel that anxious energy into something more productive. Sometimes I'll even use it to fuel a workout or creative project.

Thanks for the reminder and the positive vibes! Hope you're having an awesome day too. Keep spreading this wisdom - it's exactly what a lot of people need to hear. üí™","

Having basic needs met doesn't disqualify you from experiencing emotional struggles - mental health doesn't work that way.

What you're describing - the constant overwhelm, irritability, and feeling disconnected - sounds a lot like burnout or possibly depression. These are real challenges that many people face, even when things look ""fine"" on the surface.

It's actually really brave that you're opening up about this, even if it's just on Reddit. That's a first step. While it might feel impossible to get back to your ""normal,"" small steps can help. Maybe start by reaching out to just one person you've distanced from, or talking to a therapist if you're able. You don't have to fix everything at once.

Remember that healing isn't linear. Some days will be better than others, and that's okay. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to not be okay sometimes. Be gentle with yourself - you're going through something real and challenging.","

That wave of relief when plans get cancelled is so real. I used to feel guilty about it, but honestly, it's super common - especially for those of us who deal with social anxiety. Sometimes just the anticipation of having to be ""on"" socially can be exhausting.

That said, I've found it helpful to be more selective about making plans in the first place. It's okay to say ""let me check my schedule"" instead of immediately saying yes, or to suggest a lower-key alternative that feels less overwhelming (like meeting for coffee instead of a big group dinner).

The trick is finding the right balance - you don't want to miss out on everything just because anxiety is calling the shots, but you also shouldn't feel bad about needing downtime. Maybe try being more honest with friends about needing flexibility? Most good friends will understand if you're upfront about sometimes needing to raincheck.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?",1024,126,1566149072,"You know, sometimes it‚Äôs necessary to take care of our selves. Having anxiety is no different from calling in with the flu.

I had insomnia all night and was anxious about trying to go into work drained and wrecked from anxiety.

At that point, i felt better being openly honest about the whole situation and decided it's their problem if they think less of me for it. &lt;- great benefit from the meds, i don't worry about what others think of me as much. 

I've really benefited tremendously from the meds. I've only ever had antidepressants and talk therapy before,so, I'm very happy right now! Like accepting being happy and not paranoid that something terrible is going to destroy it all and be taken away. üëç

I've definitely called out of work due to anxiety before, and that awful cycle of anxiety ‚Üí avoidance ‚Üí more anxiety is something many of us struggle with.

First off, try not to be too hard on yourself. Anxiety is a real health issue, and taking a mental health day isn't ""running away"" - sometimes we need a day to reset. That said, I get why you're feeling guilty.

What helps me break this cycle is:
1. Reminding myself that my anxious thoughts are usually way worse than reality
2. Making a simple list of what I actually accomplished while the boss was away
3. Taking small steps - maybe send a quick email updating your boss on projects to help ease back in

Remember, your boss being away for a month means they probably have their own catching up to do and aren't hyper-focused on scrutinizing your work.

You're not alone in this. Many of us deal with work anxiety, and while it's tough, you can get through this. Consider talking to a therapist if you haven't already - they can help develop strategies for managing these situations.","

sf1p75,Anxiety,Does anybody else gets instant diarrhea from high anxiety/panic?,TheTroubledChild,"As soon as my anxiety spirals a bit too high I get diarrhea in an instant, it doesn't even have to be a full blown panic attack. It's one of the main reasons I'm isolating myself so much because I'm scared I can't always get to a toilet fast enough, if at all (like in cars). It's also not just one run of diarrhea, it can be like an ordeal of 2 or 3 runs to the toilet. I'm really not comfortable to have these ""diarrhea runs"" at a friends or family house, as they usually get quite concerned once I start running, wondering if they did something that made me sick. I honestly don't know how to go on with life when literally every tiny disturbance of my ""isolation-routine"" aggravates my overall anxiety that much. Does anybody else deal with something like that? Or overcame it?",1018,132,1643406584,"Yeah I used to have that happen with severe anxiety.

The gut-brain connection is really strong, and when you're anxious, your body releases stress hormones that can affect your digestive system directly. I dealt with this exact same issue for years and know how isolating and frustrating it can be.

A few things that helped me:
- Working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and specifically IBS/anxiety-related digestive issues
- Taking Imodium before situations I knew would be triggering (discuss with your doctor first)
- Gradually exposing myself to anxiety-producing situations, starting very small
- Deep breathing exercises and meditation to help calm my nervous system

Please know you're not alone in this. Anxiety-induced diarrhea is way more common than people talk about, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can help you develop coping strategies. They've definitely heard this before and can help you work through both the anxiety and its physical symptoms.

Don't let this keep you isolated - with the right support and tools, it can get better.","

I struggled with this for years before realizing it wasn't just me being ""paranoid"" - it's actually a really common experience, especially given how uncertain and overwhelming the world can feel these days. What helped me was:

1. Talking to a therapist who helped me understand these feelings are valid but don't have to control my life
2. Learning grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 method really helps when things get intense)
3. Building a consistent routine to give my days more structure

1. I prep for Monday on Friday afternoon now - organizing my desk, making a quick to-do list, etc. It helps me feel more in control.

2. I try to avoid leaving weekend chores for Sunday evening. Getting laundry and meal prep done earlier leaves Sunday night free for actually relaxing.

3. I made a simple Sunday evening ritual - cup of herbal tea, 20 minutes of light stretching, and some chill music. Having something pleasant to focus on helps quiet those anxious thoughts.

The most important thing I learned is that these feelings often come from dreading the unknown of the upcoming week. Breaking things down into smaller, manageable pieces really helps take away some of that overwhelming feeling.

Hope some of these suggestions help! And remember - millions of people are feeling exactly the same way every Sunday night. You're definitely not alone in this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Instead of waiting for things to go wrong, practice staying present and actually letting yourself enjoy the good moments. It's not tempting fate to be happy!

Something that really clicked for me was realizing that being anxious about the good times ending just means I'm stealing joy from my present self. The future will come regardless - might as well soak in the happiness while it's here.

I dealt with the same thing - that immediate wave of dread and physical symptoms as soon as you open your eyes. It's like your body and mind are conspiring against you first thing in the morning.

Something that helped me was setting up a super gentle morning routine. Instead of forcing myself to jump out of bed, I keep water and a small snack by my bedside. That way I can take care of those immediate physical needs without the big hurdle of getting up while feeling dizzy. I also started playing calm music or podcasts through my phone as soon as I wake up - it gives my mind something else to focus on besides anxious thoughts.

The key is being kind to yourself about it. You already know you feel better once you're up and moving, so try to hold onto that knowledge during the rough morning moments. Maybe start with just sitting up in bed for a few minutes before attempting to stand.

You're not alone in this at all. Morning anxiety is actually pretty common, even though it feels really isolating when you're going through it.","

POST TITLE: Getting out of bed is really hard for me. Is anyone else's anxiety worst in the morning?

POST BODY: My anxiety hits me the second I wake up. I feel awful and I have zero energy. I literally just want to lie in bed for the rest of the day. Waking up is hard for me in general. I have low blood pressure and I feel really groggy and dizzy when I wake up, so that makes getting out of bed even harder.

Once I do get up, eat,  have some water etc, I usually do feel better. But the problem is, mornings are hell for me, and some mornings my anxiety wins and I stay in bed till well past noon. 

Anyone have similar experiences, any tips?

(Thank you all for the support it really means a lot.)",1085,62,1601213910,You‚Äôll be okay!,143,SeikoAki,You‚Äôll be okay!,143,SeikoAki,"Hey there! I really admire your courage in facing your anxiety head-on. Taking that first step (literally!) can be super challenging, but you're absolutely right in tackling it directly. The park being just 5 minutes away makes it a perfect starting goal - challenging enough to be meaningful, but still manageable.

Quick tip: Maybe keep your phone handy and have someone you trust on speed dial just for peace of mind? And it's totally okay to take breaks or turn back if you need to - progress isn't always linear, and that's perfectly fine.

Remember that each time you make this walk, even if it feels scary, you're building evidence that you CAN do it. Your body and mind will start to learn that it's safe.

Really proud of you for pushing through this. Keep us updated on how it goes! üí™","

mzxaw6,Anxiety,just spent 2 weeks doing tests on my heart only for the cardiologist to tell me it‚Äôs anxiety lol,sadbabykitty,"the last month or so i‚Äôd been having horrible chest pains, heart palpitations everyday &amp; so i went to see my doctor &amp; he told me it came back abnormal (he thought it was a leaky valve?) so i ended up having to go see a cardiologist to do a bunch of tests, they were shocked at how high my blood pressure was, but in the end the doctor just said ‚Äúyou have some of the worst anxiety i‚Äôve ever seen you really need to work on managing it.‚Äù and basically they found nothing.
anyway it‚Äôs wild how much anxiety can effect you physically like i literally thought i was going to end up having heart surgery or something lol",1024,121,1619553955,"Oh yup lol chronic stress and anxiety causes [tons](https://www.healthline.com/health/physical-symptoms-of-anxiety#treatment) of physical symptoms as well as mental and emotional distress. 

- Muscle tension, aches and pains, weakness, cramps, painless muscle twitches, jaw clenching
- Chest pain or racing heart, heart palpitations, pounding heart, audible heartbeat
- Temporary hair loss, particularly on the crown of the head (telogen effluvium)
- Body-focused repetitive behaviors - skin/scab picking, lip/nail/cheek biting, hair pulling, bouncing of legs or wringing hands, tapping fingers, fidgeting, etc.
- Fatigue, exhaustion, irritability, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness or trouble with memory, insomnia, nightmares or trouble sleeping, frequent sleep disturbances
- Headaches, dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, sweating or shaking
- High blood pressure
- Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
- Hot flashes or chills, feeling overheated or very cold
- Nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, frequent urination, stomach or digestive problems including diarrhea and constipation
- Weak immune system, often getting colds for example

But the good news is that you can't get diagnosed without having medical causes ruled out, so you're ahead of the game already. Just need a PCP or psychiatrist to evaluate you for anxiety disorders now.",189,larki18,[deleted],20,[deleted],"Anxiety is wild like that - it can genuinely create physical symptoms that feel 100% real and scary. I went through something similar where I was convinced I had a serious heart condition, only to find out it was anxiety manifesting physically. The chest pain, palpitations, and high BP were all very real, just from a different cause than I expected.

The good news is that knowing it's anxiety means it's treatable! Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you really helpful techniques for managing those physical symptoms. Deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation helped me a ton with the chest tightness and racing heart.

Don't feel embarrassed about getting it checked out though - you did exactly the right thing. Better to confirm it's anxiety than ignore something potentially serious. And anxiety itself is a real medical issue that deserves proper care and attention. Hope you're able to find some relief soon! üíú","

Anxiety is like having your mind constantly working against you, and it's exhausting in a way that's hard to put into words. That feeling of being trapped in your own thoughts, the physical tension, the endless ""what-ifs"" - it's just brutal.

You're not alone in this struggle. Anxiety affects so many of us, and it's totally valid to hate how it makes you feel. The fact that you're acknowledging these feelings is actually a really important first step.

Have you considered talking to someone about it? Whether it's a therapist, a trusted friend, or even communities like this one - sharing the load can make a huge difference. Sometimes just putting words to the feeling, even if they're not perfect words, can help take away some of its power.

In the meantime, remember to be gentle with yourself. Anxiety isn't your fault, and you're not weak for experiencing it. You're dealing with something really challenging, and it's okay to take things one day (or even one moment) at a time.","

Something that helped me break out of this cycle was starting really small.

These gave me structured social interactions without the pressure of having to be ""on"" all the time.

Also, please don't beat yourself up about ""missing out."" There's no universal timeline for experiencing life, and managing mental health is a legitimate challenge that takes a lot of energy. You're not failing - you're recognizing something you want to change, which is actually a huge first step.

Have you considered trying Meetup groups? They have everything from hiking groups to board game nights, and people generally expect new faces, so it's less awkward. Whatever you choose, just remember that building a social life takes time, and that's okay.","

High school is literally designed to be a time of figuring yourself out - of course we all did embarrassing stuff! It's actually kind of beautiful in a way - those cringy moments mean you were putting yourself out there, trying new things, and learning who you are.

Next time that memory pops up and makes you want to die inside, try to be gentle with your past self. That person was just a kid doing their best to navigate one of the most awkward phases of life. We all have those stories, and they're part of what makes us human.","

That rain during your first test sounds absolutely terrifying, especially without prior experience in those conditions! But you didn't let that stop you, and that's what matters. You persisted and succeeded.

Now that you've got your license, take some time to practice driving in different conditions when there's less pressure. Maybe find an empty parking lot during light rain to build your confidence, or take short drives during off-peak hours. The anxiety will fade with experience.

Be proud of yourself - you set a goal and achieved it despite the challenges. That's something to celebrate, regardless of when it happened! üéâ","

Those communities have something many of us are missing - simplicity, connection to nature, and freedom from the rat race that drives so many of us to despair.

Maybe you don't need to move to Hawaii specifically, but the core idea is solid: if you're feeling hopeless enough to consider ending it all, you might as well try something dramatic first. Start with a visit maybe? Or find ways to incorporate those elements you're craving - simplicity, nature, community - wherever you are.

Something that's helped me is to challenge these thoughts directly. When I catch myself spiraling about a work interaction, I ask: ""Do I have any actual evidence that something went wrong? Would someone have told me if there was a real issue?"" Usually, the answer is no.

A few practical tips that help me:
- Writing down these worried thoughts to get them out of my head
- Reminding myself that most people are too focused on their own lives to analyze my every move
- Deep breathing exercises when the anxiety hits at bedtime
- Talking to a trusted friend who can provide a reality check

This is partly why I don't get help.",106,Midnight_CoffeeBreak,"This is so relatable and you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. That meta-awareness during anxiety/panic attacks is actually really common - it's like there are two parts of your brain, one that's experiencing the anxiety and another that's observing it almost clinically.

I used to feel the exact same way, questioning if I was somehow ""performing"" anxiety even when completely alone. But here's the thing: being aware of your symptoms doesn't make them any less real. Just like being aware you have a fever doesn't mean you're faking being sick.

In fact, that self-awareness can be a good thing - it means you're in tune with your body and can recognize when anxiety is happening. Some people use this awareness as a tool in therapy, especially for techniques like CBT where identifying symptoms is the first step to managing them.

Please don't feel guilty about your anxiety. It's a real physiological response happening in your body, whether you're conscious of it or not. Your feelings are valid, and being aware of them doesn't make them any less legitimate.","

POST TITLE: Anyone else feel so self-aware of their anxiety, it almost feels like you‚Äôre faking it?

POST BODY: Even in the middle of a mild panic attack, I can feel myself freaking out ‚Äî I know my breathing is shallow, my heart is beating really fast, and my thoughts are scrambled and erratic. But because I‚Äôm aware of all of this, it almost makes me feel bad, like I‚Äôm putting on some kind of performance, or am just reacting this way for attention (even when I‚Äôm by myself!)

Maybe it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense when I type it out, but does anyone else feel this way?

I totally get why you're feeling down. It really stings when people you consider friends don't acknowledge your special day, especially when you can see they've noticed your post. That feeling of loneliness on your birthday is particularly rough.

You know what's kind of interesting though? That F1 fan who reached out - sometimes the most genuine connections come from unexpected places. They took the time to wish you well without even knowing you personally, which says something about human kindness.

Maybe this is a good moment to reflect on your friendships and consider being more direct with people. Some folks are just bad at remembering birthdays or feel awkward about reaching out. You could try organizing something small yourself next time, even just a casual coffee meetup.

Don't let this define your whole day. You deserve to celebrate, even if it's just treating yourself to something you enjoy. And hey, you've got at least one fellow Redditor here wishing you a great birthday! üéÇ","

I deal with this too - that immediate wave of dread and tension the moment you become conscious. It's like your body goes from peaceful sleep to full fight-or-flight mode before you can even open your eyes properly.

What's helped me manage it:
- Getting up slowly and giving myself extra time in the morning so I don't feel rushed
- Deep breathing exercises right when I wake up (even while still lying down)
- Having a simple morning routine that doesn't require much thinking
- Keeping a glass of water by the bed to drink first thing
- No phone/news/emails for the first 30 minutes

The anxiety usually peaks in those first 30 minutes like you mentioned, then gradually eases off. Remember that this physical response isn't your fault - it's often related to cortisol (stress hormone) levels which are naturally highest in the morning.

Maybe try setting your alarm 15-20 minutes earlier so you can just lie there and let that initial wave pass without the pressure to immediately jump into your day? Sending support - morning anxiety really sucks but it can get better with the right strategies.","

I get those days too where even basic social interaction feels like this huge emotional labor, even with people I genuinely care about. It's not that you're actually fake or don't care - you're just socially drained and need to recharge.

Maybe try being honest with your close friends/family when you're having those days? Something like ""Hey, I'm having one of those low social battery days, might be a bit quiet"" can help manage expectations. Most understanding people will totally get it.

There's nothing wrong with taking social breaks when you need them. Sometimes self-care means protecting your energy and not forcing conversations when you're not in that headspace. The fact that you're aware of this and reflecting on it shows emotional intelligence.

Hope this week gets better for you. Remember it's okay to set boundaries and take the space you need to recharge. üôÇ","

I was really hoping to hear something positive after freak out crying on the couch for the past 10 minutes.,58,black_truffle_cheese,"This is such a powerful realization, and you should absolutely feel empowered! Learning to self-soothe and be your own source of comfort is one of the most valuable skills you can develop for managing anxiety.

That said, don't be too hard on yourself when you do need support from others sometimes - it's completely human and natural. The key difference now is that you're not depending on external validation as your only coping mechanism. You're building an internal foundation of strength while still leaving room for connection with others when you choose to.

The fact that you can now sit with those anxious feelings and talk yourself through them is huge progress. You're right that it's exhausting work - rewiring those thought patterns takes real effort. But you're already seeing the results, and each time you practice this skill, you're literally building new neural pathways that make it easier the next time.

Keep celebrating these victories. You're doing the work, and you're getting stronger every day. üí™","

That nagging feeling that you're forgetting something important or should be worried about something - it's like your brain's alarm system is going off but forgot to tell you what the emergency is!

What helps me when I get this feeling is to do a quick mental inventory: I check my calendar, scan through my responsibilities, and remind myself that if it was truly important, I'd probably remember it. Sometimes it's just our brains being overprotective and creating anxiety without a specific target.

Have you tried keeping a simple to-do list? It can help get those worries out of your head and onto paper, making them feel more manageable. Plus, when that feeling hits, you can look at your list and either identify what's bothering you or reassure yourself that everything important is accounted for.

You're definitely not alone in this, and your brain is normal - just a bit overenthusiastic about trying to keep you safe! üôÇ","

I got back from traveling with my boyfriend and today was my first day back to work...,62,pillowsandblankets4,"This is so relatable! I get that exact same anxiety, especially after being sick. There's this weird mix of worrying if you're truly well enough to return, wondering what you missed, and just feeling ""out of the loop"" even after a short break.

Something that helps me is reminding myself that this is actually super common - our brains tend to build things up way bigger than they are when we've been away. Usually, once I'm back for like 30 minutes, everything feels normal again and I wonder why I was so worried.

For the post-illness anxiety specifically, maybe pack some backup meds/supplies just in case? Having them with you can be really reassuring, even if you don't need them. And remember - if you do end up needing to leave early, it's not the end of the world. Most people are pretty understanding about that stuff.

Hope your first day back goes smoothly! Take it easy and be gentle with yourself while you get back into the swing of things.","

Kind stranger .,64,rrrrrryyy124,What does this mean,5,[deleted],"This really resonates with me. It's amazing how we can be our own worst critics, constantly feeding those negative thoughts and self-doubts until they feel like they're taking over. That internal battle is exhausting.

I've learned that treating yourself with the same kindness you'd show a good friend makes such a difference. When that critical inner voice pipes up, try to pause and ask ""Would I say this to someone I care about?"" Usually, the answer is no.

Small acts of self-compassion can help quiet that inner war. Maybe it's taking a moment to acknowledge something you did well today, forgiving yourself for a mistake, or simply taking a deep breath when those harsh thoughts start spiraling.

Remember, you're not alone in this struggle. We're all works in progress, and being gentle with yourself isn't weakness - it's necessary for growth and healing. The more you practice kindness toward yourself, the quieter that inner enemy becomes.

Keep fighting the good fight, but do it with compassion rather than criticism. You deserve that peace.","

And the three people I live with have far less qualms about clutter than I do, so I end up having to clear surfaces and put stuff away just to calm my anxiety.  I don't like that because then I build resentments because, ""why can't you all just pick up after yourselves?"" builds up until that is almost as big as a problem as the original anxiety from the clutter every where.

Maybe this is me throwing a pity party, but why is it that those of us with anxiety have to adjust to everyone else because of our anxiety instead of other people making small accomodations for us?

Edit: like sometimes I just want to yell, ""I shouldn't have to take Zoloft to keep from turning into a controlling asshole just because of everyone's lack of motivation to clean up after themselves and deal with their own shit!""",6,ScooterTheBookWorm,"Absolutely, you're not alone in this! I get really anxious when my space is disorganized too - it's like the physical clutter creates mental clutter that makes it hard to focus on anything else.

Renovations are especially tough because the mess is unavoidable and you can't just quickly fix it. What helps me in these situations is to create one small, organized ""sanctuary"" space - maybe just a corner of a room or even just your desk - that you can keep tidy and retreat to when feeling overwhelmed. It gives you a sense of control amid the chaos.

Also, try to reframe the mess as temporary and purposeful - it's not random clutter, it's part of making your home better. Maybe keep some photos of your renovation inspiration handy to remind yourself of the end goal when you're feeling stressed.

Remember to be gentle with yourself. Your reaction is totally valid and pretty common for people who find peace in order and organization. This is temporary, and soon you'll have an even more beautiful, organized space to enjoy.","

How do you get past this stuff?",1051,68,1529116969,"Yes.

I read elsewhere on reddit that if you cringe at a memory, it means you learned something. Most of the stuff you cringe at, no one else would likely remember.

I feel some pity for the person I was, remember what I learned, maybe if I did better subsequent circumstances, and try to just move on to completely different memories.",189,4CatDoc,,0,,"This is so normal - I'm in my 30s and still get those random 2am flashbacks of awkward moments from middle school! Our brains seem hardwired to replay these cringe memories, even though logically we know nobody else remembers or cares about that weird thing we said in 8th grade.

What helps me is reminding myself that everyone was figuring things out at that age. Those ""embarrassing"" moments were just part of growing up and learning who we are. Plus, the fact that you can look back and cringe actually shows how much you've grown as a person - you wouldn't cringe if you hadn't matured!

When those memories pop up, try to be kind to your younger self. That kid was doing their best with the experience and knowledge they had at the time. Maybe even try to reframe those moments with humor - they make great stories now!

Remember: the people who were there are probably too busy reliving their own awkward moments to remember yours. We're all in this cringe-filled boat together!","

I can relate to your fears. I have anxiety about driving and get so nervous when I have to go on the highway. Actually, today I drove on the highway for the first time in months. I wasn‚Äôt alone in the car but I was still nervous. I wish you luck as you continue to accomplish your goals!",67,midnightfoxzone,Yayyyy!

First time on the highway is definitely a big milestone, not a small accomplishment at all. I remember being super nervous my first time too - white-knuckling the steering wheel and probably driving exactly at the speed limit in the right lane üòÖ

It takes courage to face driving anxiety head-on like that. The more you do it, the more natural it'll feel. One tip that helped me get more comfortable was picking off-peak times for practice runs when there's less traffic. That way you can focus on getting used to the speed and merging without as much pressure.

Be proud of yourself! Conquering fears like this is how we grow. Before you know it, highway driving will feel like second nature. Keep building that confidence! üöó","

g02gqq,Anxiety,Does anyone here also suffer from rejection sensitivity?,scarypalmtrees,"If someone looks at me disapprovingly or even talks to me in an unusual tone, I tend to attribute that to them not liking me, and my body goes into fight or flight mode. I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency. I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me).

Rejection sensitivity is actually really common, especially for people who've dealt with difficult experiences in childhood. I struggle with this too, and that constant feeling of being ""on edge"" about what others think is exhausting.

Something that's helped me is trying to challenge those automatic thoughts. When I catch myself assuming someone dislikes me, I try to remember that people are usually wrapped up in their own worlds and concerns. That ""disapproving look"" might just be them thinking about their grocery list or having a rough day.

Have you considered trying therapy again? A therapist who specializes in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) could help you develop specific tools for managing these thoughts and feelings. They can also help you work through those childhood experiences in a safe space.

Remember - feeling awkward or making social mistakes doesn't make you less worthy of friendship and connection. We're all awkward sometimes, and the right people will appreciate you for who you are.","

I usually have the tendency to anticipate the worst possible outcomes, too so that usually leads to me being even more anxious. However, I recently had one of my ‚Äúworst possible outcomes‚Äù actually materialize and found that despite my anticipation I wasn‚Äôt ready for it (I always assumed that the anticipation was preparing me in some sense for the worst possible outcome). I guess the moral of the story is that anticipation is pointless lol",174,skrrtmion,I was diagnosed with GAD and the doctor told me that the result of that was that my brain attempts to anticipate every possible situation ahead of time which in turn leaves my brain just perpetually exhausted and over stressed.

I used to (and sometimes still do) get caught in that mental loop of trying to predict every possible outcome and everyone's reactions. It's exhausting, right? Like you're playing chess against a thousand different scenarios in your head instead of just experiencing life.

What helped me was realizing that this habit often comes from a place of trying to protect ourselves from uncertainty or potential negative outcomes. But here's the thing - no matter how much we try to anticipate everything, life has a way of throwing curveballs we never saw coming.

I've found it helpful to ask myself ""Is this anticipating or is this anxiety?"" and then practice letting go of scenarios I can't control. Start small - maybe try going into a conversation without mapping out every possible direction it could go. It's scary at first, but there's something freeing about allowing things to unfold naturally.

You're not alone in this, and it's okay to work on finding that balance between being prepared and actually living in the moment.","

One thing that helped me reframe my relationship with anxiety was realizing that those physical symptoms (racing heart, etc.) are actually our body's way of trying to protect us. It's an overactive alarm system, but we're not broken. We're just extra vigilant.

Love that you gave yourself proper recovery time too - that 12-hour rest was probably exactly what your body needed. You're not letting anxiety define you or stop you, but you're also not ignoring your needs. That's the sweet spot.

Keep crushing it, warrior! Just remember it's also okay to have rough days - that's not weakness, it's just being human. You've got this ""functional anxious motherfucker"" thing down pat! üí™","

ldb1h3,Anxiety,Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.,[deleted],"I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (&lt;3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets.",977,138,1612543056,"I'm sorry you feel this way, I understand that feeling of ""not having lived my life"" I too feel the same sometimes, at 28.

I know several people who completely turned their lives around in their late 20s and 30s. One of my closest friends didn't learn to drive until 28, got his first ""real"" job at 29, and is now thriving at 35. Life isn't a race with a standard timeline.

Instead of viewing your past as wasted time, try to frame this moment as your starting point. Make a list of what you want to learn/experience and tackle them one at a time. Maybe start with driving lessons or swimming classes - small wins can build momentum. And don't underestimate the strength it took to recognize these issues and seek therapy. That's actually really mature.

Your struggles with anxiety and family background are real challenges, not excuses. But they also don't define your future. You have decades ahead of you to build the life you want. Take it one step at a time, and be proud of each small progress you make.","

Thanks for asking, friend.",9,littlebirdbluess,"Yes! This is actually a really common anxiety symptom that doesn't get talked about enough. When you're anxious, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode, which can increase urine production and make your bladder more sensitive. Plus, anxiety can make you hyper-aware of bodily sensations, making you feel the urge to pee more strongly.

I dealt with this during a particularly stressful period in my life. Some things that helped me:
- Practicing deep breathing exercises
- Gradually training my bladder by trying to wait a bit longer between bathroom trips
- Cutting back on caffeine (it can make both anxiety and frequent urination worse)
- Getting checked by a doctor to rule out any medical causes

Don't feel embarrassed about it - it's a normal stress response! But if it's really impacting your daily life, talking to a healthcare provider or therapist might be helpful. They can help determine if it's purely anxiety-related or if there might be other factors at play.

Just remember you're not alone in this! Lots of us anxiety-sufferers have been there. üíú","

The realization you had - that strangers' opinions don't matter and you'll likely never see them again - is such a valuable life lesson. It's so freeing once you really internalize that! Keep holding onto that feeling and use it for other solo adventures too.

Proud of you for pushing through those anxious thoughts and treating yourself. Sometimes the smallest victories feel the biggest. Hope that ice cream was delicious! üç¶","

It sounds like you're going through an extremely rough patch right now. Taking a sick day was probably a good call - sometimes we need to step back and focus on self-care when our mental health is hitting us this hard.

Have you considered talking to a doctor or therapist about what you're experiencing? They can help determine if you're dealing with panic disorder and provide treatment options. In the meantime, some things that might help: deep breathing exercises, cold compresses, staying hydrated, and gentle activities that ground you (like your computer sessions seem to do).

You're not alone in this. Panic attacks are terrifying, but they do pass. Please be gentle with yourself while you navigate through this difficult time.","

hope you get back on the ups soon.",66,11ThisistheEnd33,"This is so relatable. Those ""good weeks"" can really mess with your head - you start getting hopeful that maybe you've finally figured it out, and then BAM, your body reminds you who's boss. It's like emotional whiplash.

I've learned to view those good periods as proof that better days ARE possible, even if they're not permanent yet. Instead of seeing it as ""failing"" when symptoms return, try to think of it as collecting data about your body. What was different during your good week? Diet, stress levels, sleep? Those clues can be valuable.

The hurdles analogy is spot-on. IBS is definitely more of a marathon with ups and downs than a straight path to recovery. On your rough days, just focus on getting through them with whatever coping strategies work for you - heating pad, safe foods, rest, etc. You're not starting over; you're just having a setback, and that's totally normal with IBS.

Hang in there. Those good weeks prove your body is capable of feeling better, even if the path isn't linear. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Here's the thing though - you've got it backwards. If YOU got HER number, you're the one who should make the first move and text her. Don't wait around hoping she'll text first, because she's probably thinking the same thing!

Keep it simple - send a casual text tomorrow saying something like ""Hey, it's [your name] from [where you met]. Had fun talking with you!"" That's all you need to get the ball rolling.

Remember, the worst that can happen is she doesn't respond, and that's not the end of the world. You'll still be the same awesome person who had the confidence to ask for her number in the first place.

What your trainer did was really unprofessional - they should know better than to leave a new employee to fend for themselves.

Please know that your reaction is completely normal and valid. Many people (myself included) have had anxiety attacks or cried at work, especially during those overwhelming first days. You're not alone in this.

Try to be gentle with yourself right now. Take some deep breaths. If you need to excuse yourself again, it's okay to say you're not feeling well. No one needs to know you were crying.

Tomorrow might be better - first days are often the hardest. But if this treatment continues, don't hesitate to speak with HR about getting proper training and orientation. You deserve better support than this.

Sending you a virtual hug. You've made it through most of the day already - that's something to be proud of. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It's like the world collectively hit the pause button, and for some of us, that's actually been a blessing in disguise. Those quiet moments on your roof sound absolutely magical - just you, your thoughts, and the birds. It's amazing how removing all the usual urban noise can help clear our heads.

Maybe this is teaching us something about what we really need to feel at peace? Sometimes the constant buzz of ""normal"" life can be more draining than we realize. While nobody wants a lockdown to continue forever, we can definitely take this lesson forward - the importance of finding those quiet moments and creating space for tranquility in our lives.

Consider keeping this rooftop ritual even after things go back to normal. Early morning or late evening when things are naturally quieter might help recreate that peaceful feeling you're experiencing now.

Stay safe and keep enjoying those moments of serenity! They're precious no matter how they come to us.","

No more awkwardly flipping through the menu while everyone's waiting or panic-ordering something random when the server comes by.

Plus, looking at menus beforehand lets you:
- Check prices and stay within budget
- Look up ingredients you're not familiar with
- Read reviews of specific dishes
- Have a backup option ready if your first choice isn't available

And hey, don't feel weird about rehearsing your order - lots of people do it! I used to get anxious about pronouncing certain dishes wrong, especially at fancy places. Pre-planning helps avoid that awkward moment of pointing at the menu and saying ""uhh... that one.""

It's actually pretty smart to be prepared. Restaurants can be noisy and rushed, so knowing what you want ahead of time lets you relax and enjoy the social experience instead of stressing about your order. You're definitely not alone in this!","

urcxuj,Anxiety,Has anyone else here gotten a panic attack from weed?,Bakio-bay,It was terrifying and my first ever panic attack. I got it from smoking a joint.,587,524,1652756454,Yes. I have had a terrible time on weed a few times. Once i got too high and it got scary so I paniced and thought i was gonna die. Weed does that sometimes,279,Queenlicka420,"Happens almost every time I smoke. I‚Äôve learned that I tolerate indica better than sativa, and lower thc levels. Sometimes I‚Äôll only do one bong hit and my anxiety is through the roof. I smoke a lot less now due to this.",13,Toxicdirty,"Yes, this is actually quite common! I've experienced it myself and know many others who have too. Cannabis-induced panic attacks can be really scary, especially if you've never had one before.

What typically happens is the THC can sometimes heighten anxiety and make you hyper-aware of your body sensations, which can spiral into panic. Your heart rate increases, you might feel disconnected, and your thoughts can race - all of which can be terrifying in the moment.

Some tips if this happens again:
- Remember it's temporary and you're safe
- Focus on slow, deep breathing
- Drink some water and find a quiet, comfortable spot
- Have a trusted friend stay with you

Going forward, if you choose to smoke again, try using less and pick a strain with lower THC content. Some people are just more sensitive to THC than others. Also, make sure you're in a comfortable environment with people you trust.

Don't feel bad about it - this reaction doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. It's a pretty normal experience that many people have had!","

Had a nice talk with the people and now a nice hair colour",52,Kirschente,"Waiting for your turn in a place like this, and then being touched by a semi-unknowned is really unsettling to me.

As someone who understands how anxiety can make even ""simple"" tasks feel overwhelming, this is a huge win. Going to the barber can be especially tough - you're in close contact with someone, having to make small talk, sitting still while they work on you... it's a lot to handle when you deal with anxiety.

Really cool to hear that meditation helped you get there. Would you mind sharing what kind of meditation practice worked for you? I'm sure others reading this would love to know what specifically helped you overcome this hurdle.

Keep celebrating these victories - they might seem small to others, but those of us who've dealt with anxiety know just how significant they really are. Each win like this builds confidence for the next challenge. üí™

I've found it helpful to think of anxiety as an overprotective friend who means well but goes way overboard. When you have those moments where the real you shines through, that's not a fluke - that's actually your natural state before anxiety started running the show.

Something that's helped me is gradually exposing myself to social situations while reminding myself that I'm safe now and those past experiences don't define my present. Each positive interaction helps rewire those anxious pathways in our brains.

You clearly have that confident, social person inside you. The anxiety isn't your personality - it's just a protective response that you can slowly work on peeling back. Be patient with yourself as you reconnect with that authentic version of you.","

The part about not being able to have depression because you can laugh really hits home - I've heard that one too. Mental health doesn't work that way. You can have anxiety/depression and still have moments of joy or laughter. That's totally normal.

It sounds like your parents are from a generation that didn't really talk about or understand mental health. While that explains their attitude, it doesn't make their comments any less hurtful or wrong.

Have you considered talking to a counselor or therapist? They can give you proper support and coping strategies, plus it helps to have someone validate your experiences when your family doesn't get it. You're not dumb, you're dealing with real challenges, and you deserve proper support and understanding.","

I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts.

Your update is encouraging though! Completing that assignment and job paperwork is a real win. Breaking things down into smaller, manageable pieces like you're doing is exactly the right approach. And having a plan to see your dad in March gives you something positive to work toward.

Just remember that while those late night hours can feel peaceful, getting proper rest will help you tackle challenges with a clearer head. Maybe try to carve out some quiet ""me time"" earlier in the evening instead? Either way, be gentle with yourself - you're dealing with a lot and doing the best you can.","

Keep building on this momentum, but also be gentle with yourself if you have setbacks. Recovery isn't always linear, and that's okay. The fact that you're aware of and acknowledging your progress shows incredible self-awareness.

If you haven't already, consider keeping a simple journal to track these positive changes - it can be really helpful to look back on during tougher days.

is6wza,Anxiety,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,golddust89,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn‚Äôt see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn‚Äôt right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It‚Äôs so fucked up. I can‚Äôt describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn‚Äôt see my partner anymore. I didn‚Äôt have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don‚Äôt know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren‚Äôt the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I‚Äôve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I‚Äôll try to respond to you all later today.",1034,72,1600031623,"Hey, I don't have some wise words, but I want to say I'm sorry this happened.  That feels scary and violating.  I'm really glad you and your partner are not hurt and the perpetrators were arrested.   

I've been burglarized twice and robbed once (I was once burglarized because I frequently left my door slightly cracked for my cat!).  It's scary, and there's no way around that.  

Overall, it sounds like the situation went really well.  I would probably need to address my fears with a therapist, but please know that from what you wrote you reacted well -- in that in the end, no one got hurt.  I am sorry that you felt the very real fear when your parter went after them.  I may have felt more comfortable letting the stuff go than going after the culprits, which was riskier.  

This may be silly to say, but I didn't get burglarized again once I kept my door closed.  Also, generally, generally, generally speaking, burglars are often opportunists and do not want to actually hurt people.  

Take care of yourself!  Do something you enjoy today - spend time with your partner if you can.",211,poofbecomingfit,"It sounds like you might be experiencing some ptsd? It definitely sounds like a traumatic event, even if things worked out okay in the end your brain may still be trying to process it all. I am sos sorry. Virtual hug! Therapy or even just talking it all over with your partner might help. 

What I really wanted to suggest was maybe a cat door? That way you can keep your doors locked but still let kitty in and out.",36,lilbrie,"What you experienced was genuinely traumatic, and it's completely normal to have these delayed feelings of fear and anxiety after such a scary incident. Your brain is basically processing everything now that the immediate danger has passed.

A few practical suggestions that might help:
- Install additional security measures (cameras, better locks, motion-sensor lights)
- Create a strict routine for checking doors/windows before bed
- Consider talking to a therapist - they can help you process the trauma and develop coping strategies
- Remember that these guys were caught and are facing consequences, which makes it less likely they'll return

The fact that you initially stayed calm and handled the situation is actually impressive. Your instincts kicked in when they needed to. But now it's okay to feel shaken up - that's your mind's way of protecting you and making you more cautious for the future.

Take extra precautions for your peace of mind, but try not to let this incident steal your sense of safety at home. With time and some added security measures, these feelings will become more manageable.","

9o5kkd,Anxiety,Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?,annacuppiecake,"Even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. And if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.

I remember there was a day where I was late to everything. I remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

What can you do to make being late ok? I know it's not a big deal to those around me if I am a few mins late, but I feel horrible about myself. ",1002,104,1539545401,Yup....this is a huge trigger for me. I hate being late. I think it is because growing up my family was always late to stuff. ,176,mintgreen23,,0,,"I totally get this - being late can trigger such intense feelings of anxiety and self-judgment, even when it's just a few minutes. I'm the same way, where being on time feels like proof that I have my life together, while running late makes me feel like everything's falling apart.

Here's what's helped me manage these feelings better:

1. Remind yourself that perfection isn't realistic. Even the most organized people run late sometimes - it's human.

2. Practice self-talk like ""I'm doing my best"" or ""This doesn't define my whole day"" when you're running behind.

3. Build in buffer time to your schedule. I started adding 15-minute cushions between appointments, which really helps reduce stress.

4. When you are late, take a deep breath and enter the situation calmly rather than rushing in apologetically. A composed ""Thanks for your patience"" is better than spiraling with guilt.

Remember, while punctuality is important, being a few minutes late occasionally isn't a character flaw. Be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend in the same situation.","

jhl2o7,Anxiety,Am I the only one who starts feeling anxious when they're actually feeling fine and good?,Literallyno1201,I don't know what it is but today when I'm feeling fine and just in a great condition in general I'm feeling even more anxious than I used to feel before??

Just when you think you‚Äôre safe it sneaks out and gets you.",129,SherbetAdmirable39,"I totally get this - it's like your brain is waiting for the other shoe to drop, right? When things are going well, anxiety can creep in because we're not ""used to"" feeling good, and that itself becomes something to worry about. It's frustratingly common with anxiety.

What helps me is reminding myself that I deserve to feel good and that it's okay to enjoy peaceful moments. Try to catch yourself when these anxious thoughts pop up and gently acknowledge them: ""I see you, anxiety, but I'm choosing to stay present in this good moment.""

Maybe write down how you're feeling when things are good, so you can remind yourself later that these positive times are real and valid. And if you find this happening often, it might be worth talking to a therapist - they can give you specific tools to help break this cycle.

You're not alone in this at all. It's okay to feel good, and you deserve to enjoy your good days without anxiety crashing the party. Be patient with yourself as you work through this ‚ù§Ô∏è","

So I planned for my year group to dress up or down, yknow wear something fun (I was clearly feeling particularly confident that day).

My parents aren't even a little wealthy

....I...hate my brain.",2,uhhcrentist,"I totally get this. Anxiety has this way of making the most irrational thoughts feel completely legitimate in the moment. Like, logically you might know it's absurd that there's some elaborate conspiracy where your friends are paid actors, but anxiety doesn't care about logic - it just feeds you these intrusive thoughts and makes them feel real.

Something that helps me is to practice recognizing these thoughts as ""anxiety lies."" When these thoughts pop up, try to pause and ask yourself: ""Is this my anxiety talking, or is this reality?"" It's like fact-checking your own brain.

Also, think about it this way - who would even be paying your friends? And why? The logistics alone make it pretty impossible. But I know that rational arguments don't always help in the moment when anxiety takes over, and that's okay. You're not alone in experiencing these kinds of thoughts.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about these intrusive thoughts? They can teach you some really helpful techniques for managing them when they pop up.","

Has anyone found a solution as to what causes this?",1010,94,1564513331,"Yes! I am the same way.

Idk how to change that tho lol",283,Idkwhogivesaf,"Yes! I am the same way.

Idk how to change that tho lol",283,Idkwhogivesaf,"I totally get this! I've experienced something similar where I feel much more at ease around older folks compared to peers. I think it often comes down to feeling pressure about social comparison and judgment with people our own age.

With older people, there's usually less pressure to ""measure up"" or compete socially. They're in a different life stage, so we don't automatically compare ourselves to them. But with peers, we might unconsciously worry about how we stack up in terms of success, appearance, social status, etc.

Something that helped me was realizing that most people our age are actually too focused on their own lives/insecurities to judge us harshly. Also, exposure therapy can work wonders - gradually putting yourself in more social situations with peers while using anxiety management techniques like deep breathing.

Have you noticed if your anxiety is worse in certain situations with people your age? Like social events vs just passing by people on the street? Understanding those triggers might help you develop better coping strategies.

Remember, this is actually a pretty common experience - you're definitely not alone in feeling this way!","

Living with mental illness can make us wish we could just take a ""vacation"" from our own minds sometimes. While we can't literally costume ourselves into perfect mental health, maybe we can use this Halloween idea to explore what that version of ourselves might look like or feel like, even if just for one night.

Maybe dress as your most confident, peaceful self? Or channel a character/person who represents the stability you're seeking? You could even make it a bit meta - wear a shirt with crossed-out anxiety/depression symbols or carry around an ""expired prescription"" for mental health meds.

Just remember - wanting a break from mental illness is totally valid, but you're worthy exactly as you are. Sometimes humor helps us cope with the heavy stuff. Hope you have a great Halloween, whatever you decide to do. üéÉ

Coffee sent me into a tailspin.,37,Lamarraine3,"I totally get this - I also have anxiety but can't imagine giving up my morning coffee ritual! From my experience and research, it's really about finding the right balance that works for YOU.

Some things that helped me continue enjoying coffee while managing anxiety:
- Switching to half-caf or limiting to 1 cup in the morning
- Making sure to eat something with my coffee to prevent jitters
- Cutting off caffeine by early afternoon
- Being mindful of my anxiety levels on any given day and adjusting intake accordingly

The morning coffee routine can actually be quite grounding and therapeutic for some people. If it brings you joy and doesn't significantly worsen your anxiety, there's no need to completely eliminate it. Maybe just pay attention to how different amounts affect you and find your sweet spot.

Everyone's anxiety triggers and tolerance levels are different. As long as you're being mindful about it and it's not making your symptoms substantially worse, it's okay to keep this part of your daily routine that you enjoy.","

It's like we're paying an emotional tax on future problems that might never even happen, right? The tricky part is that our brains are actually wired to worry - it's an evolutionary thing that helped keep our ancestors alive. But in today's world, it often does more harm than good.

Something that helps me is asking myself ""Can I do anything about this right now?"" If yes, I take one small action step. If no, I try to acknowledge the worry but not let it consume me. It's like, ""Hey brain, I see you're trying to protect me, but we don't need to solve this imaginary future problem right now.""

It's totally normal that you can't just stop worrying though - anyone who says ""just don't worry about it"" doesn't get how brains work. Maybe instead of trying to eliminate worry completely, we can work on making it more manageable? Baby steps, you know?

Meditation and therapy have helped me a lot with this, but everyone's journey is different. Be patient with yourself - you're already aware of the pattern, and that's a huge first step.","

Anxiety is such an exhausting, frustrating thing to deal with - that constant worry, racing thoughts, and physical symptoms that pop up at the worst possible times.

You know what though? The fact that you're angry at it is actually kind of healthy. It means you recognize it's the anxiety that's the problem, not you. That's a powerful perspective to have.

If you're in a particularly rough patch right now, remember the basics: deep breathing, grounding exercises, and challenging those anxious thoughts. Sometimes just going for a walk or talking to someone who gets it can help take the edge off.

And hey, if you haven't already, consider talking to a professional. They can give you some solid tools to manage this stuff. You don't have to white-knuckle it alone.

I think it's called Nocturnal Anxiety.",39,TheForkOnTheLeft-,"Yes, this is actually really common! I experience the same thing - it's like anxiety has a special love for nighttime. There's actually some science behind it: our cortisol levels naturally drop in the evening, which can make us more susceptible to anxious thoughts. Plus, when it's dark and quiet, there are fewer distractions, so our minds tend to wander and overthink things.

Something that's helped me is creating a calming evening routine. I dim the lights about an hour before bed, do some light stretching or reading, and sometimes use a meditation app. Writing down any worries that pop up can also help ""release"" them from your mind before sleep.

Also, don't feel bad about reaching out to family members when you're feeling anxious at night. Since you mentioned you live with family, maybe let them know what you're experiencing - sometimes just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference.

Remember that this pattern doesn't make your anxiety any less valid - it's just part of how our bodies and minds work. You're definitely not alone in this! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I can feel the intense frustration radiating from your post, and sometimes when things get that overwhelming, all you can do is let it out.

Want to talk about what's going on? Sometimes getting it off your chest to strangers on the internet can help put things in perspective. Whatever it is that's got you at this point - whether it's work, relationships, life in general, or just one of those days where everything went wrong - you're not alone in feeling this way.

czg41d,Anxiety,Anyone else get anxiety about having anxiety,DillSoupYT,"And because of your anxiety, caused by having anxiety, you get more anxiety.",989,110,1567571762,"Yepp. Sometimes I even wake up fine and think, where's the anxiety at? This is weird. Oh wait there it is. I sabotage myself.",209,[deleted],,0,,"Yes, this is absolutely a real thing and it's called meta-anxiety or ""anxiety about anxiety."" It's like being stuck in this frustrating loop where you start worrying about getting anxious, which then makes you more anxious, and the cycle continues. I've been there and it's exhausting.

Something that helped me was learning that anxiety itself isn't dangerous - it's just an uncomfortable feeling. When I stopped seeing my anxiety as something to fear and started viewing it more like an annoying but harmless passenger along for the ride, it actually reduced some of that secondary anxiety.

Try telling yourself ""I'm feeling anxious about being anxious, and that's okay. This feeling will pass."" Sometimes just acknowledging it without fighting it can help break that cycle.

If this is seriously impacting your life, talking to a therapist can be really helpful - they can teach you specific techniques to handle both the primary anxiety and that meta-anxiety layer. You're definitely not alone in experiencing this!","

Two years of dedicated work to overcome this is no joke, and you should be incredibly proud of reaching this milestone.

",1066,32,1535037704,[removed],75,[deleted],,0,,"Thank you for bringing attention to this important issue. You're absolutely right - people who are struggling with anxiety and depression can be particularly vulnerable to these kinds of predatory messages, especially when they're feeling desperate for relief.

If anyone receives messages like this, please:
- Report the user to Reddit admins immediately
- Block the account without engaging
- Never purchase medications from random online sources - it's both dangerous and illegal
- Talk to a doctor or mental health professional about getting proper treatment

For anyone feeling desperate enough to consider this: I know how hard it can be when you're struggling and just want the pain to stop. But buying unknown substances from strangers will likely make things much worse and could be life-threatening. There are legitimate ways to get help - reach out to your doctor, contact a mental health crisis line, or visit an emergency room if you're in crisis.

Stay safe everyone, and look out for each other in these communities. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Being constantly pushed to ""get out of your comfort zone"" when you're already struggling just to feel okay is exhausting. It's like people telling someone with a broken leg to just run a marathon - sometimes you need to heal first.

There's nothing wrong with creating safe spaces for yourself where anxiety feels manageable. That's actually a really valid form of self-care. But I think the key is finding a balance where you're not completely isolating yourself long-term, because that can make anxiety worse over time.

Maybe instead of thinking about ""facing fears,"" focus on taking tiny steps when YOU feel ready - not when others think you should. Could be as simple as sitting on your porch for 5 minutes or walking to your mailbox. No pressure to do more until those small things start feeling more comfortable.

You're not failing by needing to take care of yourself. Sometimes staying ""comfortable"" for a while is exactly what we need to rebuild our strength.","

owodyh,Anxiety,I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,desertpancake,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.",987,110,1627939857,"Me too, me too...

Turns out adults can be very ignorant as long as you're quiet and out of the way.

It's hard to let that go. Whether it's parents who did nothing or professionals who did nothing. The resentment is hard to let go when you're stuck with the consequences of their inaction.",127,poisontongue,"I had a tough time getting over this too... the reality is though if you don‚Äôt suffer with anxiety it can be tough to understand. Most ppl see stuff as just a kid being awkward or having to grow into the person they are and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean people didn‚Äôt care just that they didn‚Äôt recognize it and also that if you‚Äôre anxious you usually do a good job at hiding it, I know I lied my entire childhood it seemed to not feel so much anxiety with my family and friends.",118,NightRaven1122,"I hear the pain and betrayal in your words, and your anger is completely valid. It's devastating to look back and realize that the adults who should have protected and supported you missed or dismissed clear signs that you were struggling. That swimming incident sounds genuinely traumatic, and your mother's casual dismissal of it now must feel like reopening an old wound.

Try to remember that while your feelings are absolutely justified, most adults in the past (especially 20 years ago) weren't as aware of childhood anxiety and trauma as we are today. This doesn't excuse their failures, but it might help explain them. They should have done better, but they likely didn't have the knowledge or tools we have now.

The good news is that you're taking steps to heal now. You're breaking the cycle by recognizing these issues and seeking help. It's okay to be angry - that anger can be part of the healing process. But don't let it consume you. Focus that energy into your current journey of healing and self-discovery.

You deserved better then, and you're doing the right thing by taking care of yourself now.","

That awful feeling when anxiety jolts you awake before your alarm, and then you just lie there with your thoughts spiraling... it's like having an unwanted roommate that doesn't respect your sleep schedule.

Something that's helped me is having a ""landing pad"" thought ready for these moments. When I wake up anxious, I immediately try to redirect to something simple and grounding - like planning what I'll have for breakfast or remembering a nice moment from yesterday. It doesn't always work perfectly, but it gives my brain somewhere else to go besides the anxiety spiral.

Also, I've learned to be gentler with myself about it. Instead of getting frustrated that anxiety woke me up (which just adds more anxiety), I try to think ""Ok, this is just my brain being overprotective again. Thanks for trying to keep me safe, brain, but we're actually okay right now.""

If anyone gives you grief about eating alone, remember that taking care of your mental energy is just as important as the physical act of eating. You're not being antisocial - you're practicing self-care in a way that works for you.

Keep enjoying those peaceful solo lunches! They're probably making you a better coworker/friend/person for the rest of the day anyway since you're coming back refreshed rather than drained.","

c05zqf,Anxiety,I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,whutamievendoing,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

What happened was a tragic accident - you were just a child trying to help, and no 8-year-old can fully understand the dangers of leaving a young child alone in water. You weren't being malicious; you were trying to be helpful while the adults were busy.

The fact that you're still in therapy and struggling with this shows how much you care and how deeply it affected you. Your mother is right - it wasn't your fault. Children aren't equipped to be responsible for the safety of other children, which is why adult supervision is so important during bath time.

I understand why you feel your mother is disgusted with you, but grief can make us misinterpret others' emotions. She's likely dealing with her own complex feelings about that day, but her telling you it wasn't your fault shows she understands the truth of the situation.

Please keep going to therapy and working through this. You deserve to heal. Consider joining a support group for people who've experienced traumatic loss - it might help you feel less alone in processing this.","

Growing up with severe anxiety that went unaddressed is like carrying a heavy weight that just gets heavier over time. It's especially tough when your parents, despite loving you, don't have the cultural framework to understand what you're going through.

Please know that while early intervention would have helped, it's never too late to start healing. I started therapy in my late 20s and while I sometimes feel bitter about ""lost time,"" I've made real progress. The tools and coping strategies are still valuable at any age.

Your message about getting kids help early is so important. You're turning your painful experience into something that might help other parents recognize these signs in their own children, and that's really admirable.

Have you considered seeking professional help now? Many therapists nowadays specialize in cultural issues and childhood trauma. You deserve support in processing both your anxiety and the experience of growing up without the help you needed.

You're not alone in this, and it's not your fault things got this far. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Being able to make not just one, but THREE calls, and doing some while in public? That's seriously impressive.

The best part is that each successful call helps build confidence for future ones. You're literally rewiring your brain to associate phone calls with ""I can do this"" instead of panic. And the fact that you noticed the physical symptoms were different this time (no racing heart, sweating, etc.) shows real improvement in how your body is responding.

Keep celebrating these wins, no matter how small they might seem to others. You're crushing it! Maybe try keeping a little log of successful calls to look back on when you need a confidence boost for future challenging situations.","

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I feel like I'm already pushing my comfort zone just by existing sometimes. The whole ""get uncomfortable!"" advice feels really tone-deaf when your baseline is already discomfort.

Maybe instead of pushing ourselves further into discomfort, we should actually work on finding and expanding moments of genuine comfort first. Like, it's hard to grow from a place of constant anxiety - we need some stable ground to stand on.

Have you ever worked with a therapist who really understands anxiety? They might be able to help you develop tools to find those moments of actual comfort, rather than just pushing through more discomfort. The goal shouldn't be to always be uncomfortable - it should be about learning when to challenge ourselves and when it's okay to just... exist.

Your feelings are totally valid here. Sometimes well-meaning advice just doesn't apply to everyone's situation, and that's okay.","

I feel like a nuisance and burden to everyone around me. Lately all I want is to just be in a coma and be free from all the self doubt and feelings of being unworthy of even existing. 

The one ounce of reassurance I‚Äôve learned is that everyone is too caught up in their own shit to even give more than a passing thought to you. We convince ourselves that whatever we did or said is end all be all but the truth is it was just a passing moment for most and they‚Äôre back to focusing on whatever they‚Äôve got to get through that day. That‚Äôs not to say that people don‚Äôt care, just that we‚Äôre all so self focused it would be impossible to get anything done if everyone focused on every minute interaction. 

We‚Äôre all struggling, now more than ever. But remember you‚Äôre just a person passing by in most cases. You got this. You will get through today, tomorrow, and the next.

I struggled with similar thoughts for years, constantly analyzing every interaction and assuming the worst when someone took a while to text back.

What helped me realize is that these thoughts often say more about our own insecurities than other people's actual feelings toward us. Most people are wrapped up in their own lives and aren't scrutinizing our every move the way we imagine they are.

Something that really helped me was to catch myself when I start spiraling into those ""they must hate me"" thoughts and ask: ""What actual evidence do I have for this?"" Usually, there isn't any - it's just anxiety creating worst-case scenarios.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? These sound like symptoms of social anxiety, and having a professional help you develop better thought patterns can make a huge difference. In the meantime, try to remember that if these friends keep choosing to spend time with you, it's because they genuinely enjoy your company. We're often our own harshest critics.","

mto6m2,Anxiety,The key to beating anxiety is giving up control,Professional-Soup525,"We can‚Äôt control what people think or the world around us. I‚Äôve struggled most of my life with various forms of anxiety and the more I thought about a certain issue, the worst my fear got. Overthinking is our way of trying to control our fears. Its uncomfortable letting go of our thoughts and letting action guide us , but it‚Äôs the only way forward. This is a more elegant way of just saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù.",983,107,1618788580,"Agreed. The Flow philosophy, stoicism, and optimistic nihilism are some of the philosophies that help fight anxiety by directly contradicting and negating it. If you are willing to lose and willing to give up, there is nothing to torment you with. 

The moment you decide to take control and fight, wham bang, it's back. Float through life like a leaf on a river, seeing what life has to show without asking for anything, without yearning for safety. Takes a little faith (not religious) in the universe, but there are ways to logically justify such faith.",135,nojox,"Completely agree - one method I employ when anxiety hits is to just let it hit me. I don‚Äôt fear it or try to reason with it - I just say to myself, ‚Äúhey, there you are‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs not easy but I find it helps.",11,chubbyburritos,"This really resonates with me. I spent years trying to ""think"" my way out of anxiety, only to find myself trapped deeper in those thought spirals. You're absolutely right - the more we try to control everything, the more anxious we become about all the things we can't control.

I like how you frame it as ""letting action guide us."" That's similar to what my therapist calls ""committed action"" - basically, moving forward with your values even when your anxiety is screaming at you to stop and overthink. It's like swimming in cold water - at some point you just have to jump in rather than standing at the edge thinking about how cold it might be.

Your ""fuck it"" approach reminds me of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Instead of fighting our thoughts or trying to control them, we acknowledge them and move forward anyway. It's not about getting rid of anxiety - it's about learning to carry it with us while still living our lives.

It's definitely uncomfortable at first, but there's something weirdly freeing about surrendering that illusion of control.","

I started going to shows alone a few years ago and honestly sometimes prefer it now - you can totally focus on the music, move around wherever you want, and don't have to worry about keeping track of anyone else. Plus, concert crowds tend to be pretty welcoming to solo attendees in my experience.

This is a great confidence builder. Keep challenging yourself at your own pace - each small victory like this one makes the next adventure a little easier. Really proud of you for pushing through and having this positive experience! üéµ","

nlq59n,Anxiety,Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting?,chocearthling,"I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again.... 

How are you guys handling going back to some form of ""normal"" or ""before""?",952,138,1622059480,"I felt so anxious over a year ago when this all started. Then I got comfortable in my bubble. Restrictions lifting made me anxious, everything returning to normal makes me anxious, the thought of taking a vacation that I really need is making me anxious. On top of all that I‚Äôm doing my best to find a job before my unemployment is over, and I‚Äôm having no luck. I also have a soon to be five year old to send to school in September and that‚Äôs making me anxious as well‚Ä¶..so let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm not  doing too well :(",164,Potential-Reason-763,"Masks have become comforting in an incognito sort of way. They hide my wonky teeth &amp; the occasional cold sore, plus nobody can see me talking to myself.",31,Rscamp1981,"I totally get where you're coming from. The pandemic created this weird ""safe bubble"" for many of us, and now that things are opening up, it's like we have to relearn how to be social again. It's completely normal to feel anxious about this transition - you're definitely not alone.

Maybe try easing back into things gradually? Instead of jumping straight into big social situations, start with small, controlled meetups with your friend in outdoor settings where you feel safer. This could help you rebuild your comfort level while still being mindful of your health concerns.

Don't beat yourself up about feeling this way. The pandemic has changed all of us, and it's okay if you're not immediately ready to go back to your pre-COVID social butterfly self. Your anxiety is a valid response to a really unusual situation.

For your vacation, perhaps plan something that balances safety and social interaction - like a day trip to a quiet outdoor location with your friend? This way you can enjoy some companionship while staying within your comfort zone.

Remember, there's no rush to ""go back to normal."" Take it at your own pace.","

Something that helped me was learning that anxiety symptoms are actually our body's natural protection system going into overdrive.

Next time you're having those scary symptoms, try reminding yourself ""This is just anxiety being an overprotective bodyguard. It feels real, but I've been here before and I got through it.""

p5rmw7,Anxiety,People don't understand what anxiety is,[deleted],"People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

It's so much more than just ""being worried"" - it's a full-body, life-altering condition that affects everything from your physical health to your ability to do basic daily tasks.

As someone who's dealt with anxiety, I've found that one of the hardest parts is feeling like others don't understand or validate how debilitating it can be. You're absolutely right that we need better medical support and understanding from healthcare providers.

Have you considered connecting with anxiety support groups? Whether online or in-person, being around others who truly understand what you're going through can be incredibly validating and helpful. They often have great coping strategies to share, and sometimes just knowing you're not alone in this struggle can make a difference.

- Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 breathing works great)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Light exercise or stretching
- Going for a walk outside
- Taking a warm shower
- Using a weighted blanket if you have one

Sometimes our bodies need help resetting the nervous system even when our thoughts are fine. Think of it like your body's alarm system getting stuck in the ""on"" position - it needs help switching back to ""rest mode.""

If this happens often, you might want to talk to a doctor or therapist about it. They can help identify triggers and give you more specific tools to manage these physical symptoms.

Hang in there - this feeling won't last forever! üíú","

hk5rud,Anxiety,I‚Äôve started therapy for my anxiety,WearALotOfBlue,"I just wanted to tell someone, just anyone.

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i‚Äôm doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

**Edit #2: I WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST IN YOUR LIVES! YOU'VE ALL MADE MY DAY!**

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!",982,107,1593725034,"hey, good job. important  (but often difficult) first step",84,greatergoon,"hey, good job. important  (but often difficult) first step",84,greatergoon,"This is such a huge step and you should be really proud of yourself! Taking that first step to get help is often the hardest part, and you did it. As someone who also waited years before getting help for anxiety, I know how much courage it takes.

I love that you're already feeling positive effects just from starting the process. That's such a good sign! And you're absolutely right in your edit about therapy being key - working through those thought patterns with a professional can be life-changing.

Don't feel any pressure to tell people in your life until you're ready. This journey is yours, and you get to decide who to share it with and when. The fact that you're taking care of your mental health is what matters most.

Keep going - there might be ups and downs in the therapy process, but you've already shown incredible strength by starting. Wishing you all the best on your journey to better mental health! üí™","

This is such a huge step and you should be really proud of yourself. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we need help and even more to actually take action on it. That feeling of relief you're experiencing is totally valid - I felt the same way when I finally made my first appointment.

Please don't feel embarrassed - seeking therapy is a sign of strength, not weakness. You're investing in your mental health and wellbeing, which is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Would you feel embarrassed about going to a doctor for a broken arm? This isn't any different.

The first appointment can feel a bit nerve-wracking, but remember that therapists are professionals who talk to new clients every day. You don't have to have everything figured out or know exactly what to say. Just be honest about what brought you there.

You've already done the hardest part by making the appointment. Wishing you all the best on your therapy journey! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I know that once tomorrow comes it'll likely calm my nerves a bit but still nothing sets my anxiety off more than going back to college,1005,82,1599388020,"I always have, even though I love going to school. Now that I'm two weeks in I'm totally relaxed, but before that I was panicking. I even forgot to bring my socks (I always forget something, it sucks). Too bad your professor and classmates are jerks.",69,nomnomr,"Yes! Exactly the same as you. I'm driving back to uni tonight and I'm only there for 3 nights as it's a short week and my anxiety is through the roof. I felt like I couldn't breathe yesterday. I feel like I've wasted the last week getting worked up about something that I know will be totally fine!

Also to add that that is horrible that students and teachers bully you! Have you spoken to anyone at the college about it?",23,jeffica01,"I totally get this feeling - that pit in your stomach before going back is so real, especially when you're dealing with bullying from both students and a teacher (which is completely unacceptable, by the way). It's completely normal to feel anxious, and you're not alone in this.

You made a really good observation about how the anticipation is often worse than the actual day. Our minds tend to spiral with ""what-ifs"" during breaks, making everything seem scarier than it actually is.

Have you considered talking to a school counselor or trusted advisor about the bullying situation? No one should have to deal with that, especially from a teacher. In the meantime, try to identify a few ""safe spaces"" on campus (library, specific classroom, counseling office) where you can go when feeling overwhelmed.

Also, maybe plan something nice for yourself after that first day back - like watching your favorite show or getting your favorite snack. It gives you something positive to focus on.

Remember: your feelings are valid, and this anxiety doesn't define you. You've gotten through tough school days before, and you'll get through this one too.","

I could've settled for someone who didn't understand or support me, but I had the confidence to leave those relationships and wait for the perfect partner. 

I'm really glad about that. It was tempting just to have someone next to me. Waiting for real love is worth it, even when you feel like you'll never meet your soul mate.

Happy Anniversary and I hope theres many, many more to come.",68,sharksinyermouth,Happy anniversary ! I‚Äôm so happy for you !,20,Putmeintheocean,"This is so heartwarming to read! It's amazing how much of a difference it makes when your partner truly understands and supports your mental health journey. Having someone who doesn't dismiss your anxiety as ""just being dramatic"" or tell you to ""just get over it"" is absolutely life-changing.

You're absolutely right about not settling. Being alone can be really hard, but being with someone who doesn't understand or support you can be even harder and more isolating. The fact that you had the strength to wait for the right person, even when it was difficult, shows incredible self-worth.

And hey, Tinder success stories are more common than people think! Sometimes the right person comes along in unexpected ways. I'm really happy you found someone who makes you feel like you're part of a team - that's what true partnership is all about.

Thanks for sharing this - it's a great reminder that being patient and maintaining high standards for how we deserve to be treated really does pay off in the end. Wishing you both continued happiness! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I feel like I‚Äôve been robbed of so many quality thoughts and feelings.,254,hammerjake,"As someone who's worked through anxiety, I can totally relate to that constant mental chatter. But here's something I learned in therapy that blew my mind: most people's thoughts are actually pretty mundane and fleeting. They might think ""I'm hungry"" and then just... go make a sandwich. No analyzing the implications of their hunger or wondering if they deserve to eat.

Non-anxious people often think about:
- What they're currently doing
- Basic needs/plans (""need to get gas later"")
- Random observations (""that cloud looks like a dog"")
- Pleasant daydreams

The big difference isn't the content - it's the intensity and ""stickiness"" of the thoughts. Their thoughts tend to float by like clouds rather than becoming spiral staircases of analysis.

Have you tried mindfulness? It helped me understand that I'm not my thoughts - I'm just the observer watching them go by. You don't need to engage with every thought that pops up. It takes practice, but it's possible to loosen that grip anxiety has on your mind.","

If you don't no one else will either,101,betweenthelines9,"That's awesome! It takes real courage to speak up about mental health at work, especially when asking for schedule changes. You should absolutely be proud of yourself - not only did you advocate for your needs, but you did it professionally and honestly. 

It's also great that your manager was understanding. More workplaces are finally starting to recognize that mental health is just as important as physical health, and good managers know that well-rested employees are better employees.

One small suggestion though - you might want to have a gentle conversation with your mom about not making schedule changes on your behalf. While I'm sure she means well, you're clearly capable of handling these conversations yourself!

Keep taking care of yourself and speaking up when you need to. Every time you do it, it gets a little easier. Those two days off are well-deserved - make sure to use them to properly rest and recharge! üí™","

You've already proven you can change your brain through the work you've done so far. That's literally rewiring your neural pathways, even if it feels painfully slow.

Have you considered working with a psychiatrist alongside your other efforts? Sometimes combining different approaches (therapy, medication, lifestyle changes) can help lighten that weight, even if it doesn't completely remove it. You shouldn't have to carry this burden alone.

er2fjs,Anxiety,I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,ghetto_oldsoul,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

&amp;nbsp;


**Edit** : Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time to write a beautiful comment! I am really blessed and I'll never forget that! I hope  my story encourages you to reach out to people. You're not alone. Again, thank you so much :)",1035,46,1579468520,"That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm happy your family was there for you.

I hope everything will go well for you!! Stay strong! ‚ù§",1,nerdforeverrrrrr,"This is such a beautiful and touching story. It takes so much courage to be vulnerable and open up about mental health struggles, especially as a teenager talking to parents. I'm really proud of you for taking that step.

Your dad's reaction was wonderful - he validated your feelings, offered professional support without pressure, and then took concrete actions to help improve your situation. The fact that your parents immediately started planning ways to be more present and create a happier home environment shows how much they care, even if they've been busy.

Your little brother's reaction is especially touching. It shows how mental health struggles affect the whole family, and how opening up can actually bring everyone closer together.

You're absolutely right that reaching out for help is so important. Many people suffer in silence thinking they're alone or that no one will understand. Your story is a perfect example of how family can surprise us with their support and love when we give them the chance.

Keep leaning on your support system - you deserve all this love and care. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

s4nn4g,Anxiety,Does anyone wake up hours before alarm because you are anxious about something that next day?,[deleted],"Happened to me today!

Barely slept and still had 3 more hours to sleep but my body noped out of that and woke me up.

What am I supposed to do with those 3 hours???

Worry more???

Wtf body I hate anxiety.",992,84,1642263158,"Anxiety is the most successful alarm clock for sure, it's awful but I'm never late for anything lol",130,The-Invalid-One,,0,,"Ugh, I know this feeling all too well! That awful anxiety-induced early wake-up is the worst, especially when you're already stressed about the day ahead.

Instead of lying there letting your thoughts spiral, here are a few things that help me:
- Get up and do something gentle/calming (reading, stretching, simple tasks) rather than tossing and turning
- Write down what's making you anxious - sometimes getting it out of your head and onto paper helps
- Deep breathing exercises or a quick meditation (I use the Calm app)
- Make yourself a warm drink and just accept that you're up early today

Your body is trying to ""help"" by making sure you don't miss whatever you're worried about, even though it's actually making things worse. Super annoying but pretty normal when you're anxious about something important.

Be kind to yourself today - maybe plan for an early night tonight to catch up on sleep. And remember that even if you're tired, you've handled important days on little sleep before and you'll get through this one too! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

ia7nas,Anxiety,Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,[deleted],"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels &amp; frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time &amp; we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)",968,107,1597499322,"Oh yes.

News fatigue and anxiety are completely normal reactions to the constant barrage of information we face today. You're not being immature at all - you're actually practicing good self-care by recognizing what affects your mental health and setting boundaries.

It's great that you've found healthy alternatives like knitting, learning Irish, and focusing on activities that bring you peace. Those are exactly the kind of positive coping mechanisms that help maintain balance. And making soft toys for others? That's such a wonderful way to spread joy while keeping yourself grounded!

Instead of completely disconnecting, maybe try setting specific, limited times to check reliable news sources (like once a day or even once a week). This way you can stay informed without being overwhelmed. You might also want to look into ""slow news"" services that focus on deeper, less sensational coverage.

Remember: being informed doesn't mean you need to consume news 24/7. Taking care of your mental health isn't selfish - it's necessary. And you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.","

tbbjms,Anxiety,Anyone else mindlessly scroll through your phone all day ?,MysticOnyx,I feel like when my anxiety is super bad I will sit for HOURS just mindlessly scrolling through my phone it‚Äôs so bad. I could sit all day and do it.,976,99,1646953203,Yes so I got rid of tiktok Fb Instagram and Twitter. Now I‚Äôm just here but only do it for a few mins. My screen time has dropped drastically. But I also play candy crush lol,115,Annazing,Yes and I also disassociate when I do it so I don't remember a thing I've even looked at.,68,Girlcanstitch,"I totally get this - phone scrolling becomes like this anxiety-numbing safety blanket when things get overwhelming. I've definitely lost entire afternoons to mindless scrolling when my anxiety is high. It's like your brain is too wired to focus on anything ""real"" but needs something to latch onto.

What helped me was setting app timers and gradually replacing some scroll time with other soothing activities - even simple stuff like taking a short walk, doing a 5-minute guided meditation, or making tea. The key is being gentle with yourself about it. You're not failing or being lazy - your brain is just trying to cope.

Maybe try setting small ""scroll breaks"" where you put the phone down for just 10 minutes at first. Do something else, even if it's just stretching or taking some deep breaths. Over time, those breaks can get longer.

Remember that this is a really common anxiety response. You're not alone in this at all. Be kind to yourself while working on healthier coping strategies. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I do the exact same thing and have actually been trying to break this habit lately. It's like we use ""lol"" as a social buffer to soften our messages, even when nothing is actually funny.

What helped me was realizing that when others text me without these fillers, I never interpret their messages as harsh or rude. If anything, direct communication feels more authentic. Plus, overusing ""lol"" can sometimes make us seem less confident in what we're saying.

Maybe try this: Before adding ""lol"" or ""haha,"" ask yourself if you'd actually laugh at what you're saying in person. If not, try sending the message without it. Start with people you're comfortable with, like close friends. You might find that your messages are perfectly fine on their own!

Remember, most people are way more focused on what you're saying than analyzing your texting style. We're all just trying our best to communicate clearly in this weird world of digital interaction haha (okay, I couldn't help myself with that one üòÖ)","

8emp1b,Anxiety,does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?,gmaenrwad,"about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn‚Äôt breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn‚Äôt worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it‚Äôs over now and i‚Äôm with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven‚Äôt been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that‚Äôs coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks.",887,185,1524594346,"It can cause physical sickness,  yea I can get so nauseous and can't eat many times.

",191,snubble18,A couple nights ago I had a really bad panic attack and I normally never get sick during it but this time I threw up and it was so horrible. I understand. Trust me.,12,MysticRogue93,"Yes, physical symptoms from anxiety are absolutely real and very common! What you're describing - the nausea, racing heart, difficulty breathing - these are all typical manifestations of severe anxiety and panic responses. Your body was going through real trauma after discovering that betrayal.

It's completely understandable that you still experience these physical reactions even now, especially during stressful situations like exams. Trauma can leave lasting imprints on our nervous system that get triggered by stress.

Have you considered talking to a counselor or therapist? They can teach you specific techniques to help manage these physical symptoms, like deep breathing exercises or grounding methods. For immediate relief during anxious moments, try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. It helps bring you back to the present moment.

You're not alone in this, and you're not putting in ""double effort"" for nothing - you're dealing with real anxiety symptoms that make everyday tasks more challenging. Be patient with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

fyg254,Anxiety,Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?,Skerivo,"My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach. When I become really anxious (for no reason just because), I'll become nauseous (along with other symptoms). Except, while most people are scared of vomiting, I'm petrified. I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop. It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?",961,111,1586526229,"My anxiety is connected to my stomach but I also have IBS so when I get anxious I get nauseous and have mild to severe stomach pains (as well as eating certain foods). If I'm doing something out of my comfort zone I always have to rush to the toilet. 

Throwing up makes me scared but fortunately I take comfort in the fact I haven't thrown up in years",81,DryTeaStain,"I have the same issues. My advice would be to seek help asap. The longer it goes on, the harder it is to end this terrible loop. Any stomach issues or chest pain throw me into horrible panic.",13,rae2176,"Yes, I absolutely relate to this! What you're describing sounds like emetophobia (fear of vomiting), and it's actually quite common, especially among people with anxiety disorders. That awful feedback loop between anxiety and nausea is something I've experienced too - it's like your body and mind are working against each other.

Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety and phobias? They can teach you specific techniques to break that cycle when it starts. In the meantime, some things that help me are:

- Deep belly breathing (I know it sounds clich√©, but it really helps settle the stomach)
- Ginger tea or candies
- Cold compress on the back of my neck
- Reminding myself that nausea from anxiety almost never actually leads to vomiting

You're definitely not being irrational or stupid - phobias are real and valid, and the physical symptoms of anxiety can be incredibly overwhelming. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to manage it. Sending support your way! üíú","

Power to you for speaking up for yourself!,132,captaincocoabear,"That's a huge win - standing up to confrontational people is really tough, especially when you're dealing with anxiety. Living with a volatile couple who regularly fight must be incredibly draining, both mentally and physically. Nobody should have to walk on eggshells in their own home.

Have you and your boyfriend considered looking for a new living situation? While it's great that you stood up for yourself (seriously, that takes guts!), living with a combative couple who regularly disturb the peace probably isn't sustainable for your mental health long-term.

In the meantime, maybe try documenting the incidents and having a calm sit-down with both housemates to establish some house rules about noise and respect. If they're not receptive, at least you'll know you tried addressing it maturely before making other arrangements.

Keep advocating for yourself - you deserve a peaceful living space and your feelings are totally valid. Proud of you for finding your voice today!","

It's such a common experience with social anxiety, and it can feel so isolating when you're in that headspace.

Something that helps me is remembering that most people are way too focused on their own lives/worries to be critically analyzing everything you do. That person who gave you a weird look? They were probably just thinking about their upcoming dentist appointment or what to make for dinner.

Also, try to challenge those thoughts when they come up. Ask yourself: ""What actual evidence do I have that everyone hates me? Is this anxiety talking or reality?"" It takes practice, but getting into this habit can help separate anxious thoughts from facts.

You're definitely not alone in this. Social anxiety lies to us, but recognizing these thoughts for what they are - anxiety symptoms, not truth - is a huge first step. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can give you some really effective tools for managing these feelings.","

mjk0hm,Anxiety,my coworker recognized that I have anxiety,missdundermifflin,"I just started a job working at Dairy Queen as a cashier (this is my third day). I don‚Äôt make the food, I take orders and money, bring/give food to people, and clean up the store/restock when needed. today, I messed up an order. me and four of my coworkers were standing in a circle trying to figure out the confusion, when I, using my classic dry humor to cope, said ‚ÄúOh my God I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack now‚Äù. One of my coworkers said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, breathe in, breathe out‚Äù. Later, she came up to me and asked if I had anxiety. I said yes, I‚Äôve had it since I was 7. She said to let me know if anything was ever overwhelming me, and she would help me out. it‚Äôs honestly one of the sweetest things anyone has ever said to me.",1034,37,1617492617,"This melted my heart.

Actually, had a panic attack while eating lunch one day 6ft away from him. Didn‚Äôt say a damn word. Just found 3 things to look at SLOWLY, 3 things to smell and 3 of my favorite things, (I like that movie üòÇ). 

Proud of you.",159,CassMayy,"Next time try using gum as it keeps your brain from engagement of fight or flight response, another technique to consider is breathing slow and deep, hold your breath for 3 seconds and exhale. The reason for this is because your beginning to hyperventilate, which causes your body to not be able to get the oxygen needed in your blood, holding your breath shortly allows the oxygen to be absorbed. Also you should be drinking water everyday but 3 to 4 bottles is enough per day. Drinking too much can lower your electrolytes, also no good for anxiety. Just a little advice I learned and that helped me. üôÇ",14,SeaworthinessCalm713,"That's such a wonderful interaction! It's amazing when coworkers show genuine empathy and understanding, especially when you're new and still learning the ropes. Everyone makes mistakes during training - that's totally normal - but having anxiety can make those moments feel so much more intense.

It sounds like you've found yourself working with someone who really gets it. Take her up on that offer if you need to! Having someone in your corner at work who understands anxiety and is willing to help can make such a huge difference in feeling comfortable in your role.

Also, props to you for being able to use humor in stressful moments - that's actually a really healthy coping mechanism. Keep being open about your experiences when you feel comfortable doing so. You never know who else might be dealing with similar challenges and finding comfort in knowing they're not alone.

POST TITLE: my coworker recognized that I have anxiety

POST BODY: I just started a job working at Dairy Queen as a cashier (this is my third day). I don‚Äôt make the food, I take orders and money, bring/give food to people, and clean up the store/restock when needed. today, I messed up an order. me and four of my coworkers were standing in a circle trying to figure out the confusion, when I, using my classic dry humor to cope, said ‚ÄúOh my God I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack now‚Äù. One of my coworkers said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, breathe in, breathe out‚Äù. Later, she came up to me and asked if I had anxiety. I said yes, I‚Äôve had it since I was 7. She said to let me know if anything was ever overwhelming me, and she would help me out. it‚Äôs honestly one of the sweetest things anyone has ever said to me.

jfe6ha,Anxiety,I'm genuinely tired from overthinking and worrying about useless stuff.,Normal-Anxious,"Someone hit me, so I could cry instead and divert my focus. Or take my heart out,so I won't feel the heart palpitations as I get anxious and stressed. It's frustrating and simply tires me out. Like, I can barely breathe. I'm so tired of this cycle of worrying and overthinking. 

Fuck this shit, I want to only focus on good things even though I don't have any, I'll make some, I guess.

Edit; I really thank you for your comments and helpful advices. It means alot.. Also, to the people in same situation as me, hang on, friend! We're all in this together.",1007,60,1603291522,"I get it. I'm so exhausted mentally from overthinking and constant worry about EVERYTHING. My mind immediately jumps to worst case scenario for anything that happens. Physically I feel like I could run a marathon but mentally, forget it. Sometimes I can't even speak correctly because my brain is trying to process too much information about everything and anything.",145,happyjeep_beep_beep,I've been there for most of the past 10 years. I'm a 37 year old woman who would have to call my mom at least once a day to help distract me from all my anxious thoughts and feelings. Last year I finally started therapy and medication and I feel like my old self again.,18,Merth1983,"I feel this so deeply. That cycle of anxious thoughts spinning out of control until you can barely breathe - it's absolutely exhausting, both mentally and physically. Please know you're not alone in this struggle.

Have you tried any grounding techniques? When I'm caught in that spiral, I use the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. It helps bring you back to the present moment instead of getting lost in those overwhelming thoughts.

I love that despite everything, you're still determined to focus on creating good things. That takes real strength. Maybe start really small - like treating yourself to a favorite drink or taking a 10-minute walk somewhere peaceful. Those tiny positive moments can help break up the anxiety cycle.

And please consider talking to a mental health professional if you haven't already. They can give you more tools to manage these feelings. Sending you strength - you've got this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

How nice would it actually be to not think and feel at all huh. It doesn't help that the people around me see this robot as a 'strong' person who can stay composed at the face of adversity. I'm not strong and I wish I can just yell it out but that would cause more pain within the family that would only end with one affected party, which is, *surprise surprise,* me. I don't have my life figured out at 20 and my mind is very persistent in chasing this hourglass time limit of succeeding in life.

This gives people the wrong mindset growing up as if living with your parents is a bad thing. I'm 25 and still love living together with my parents and help support them like they did to me. It's a blessing to be together with my family. Its not like I'm going to spend the rest of my life with them, so I want to enjoy time with them when I have the chance",39,RainyEclipse,"I feel this so deeply. That pressure to have it all figured out in your 20s is such BS, and it's exhausting trying to maintain that ""strong, composed"" image while falling apart inside.

Here's the truth: most people in their 20s are just pretending to have their shit together. I'm in my 30s now and can tell you that life isn't a race with some magical deadline. Some of the most successful and happy people I know didn't find their path until their 30s or even 40s.

That numbness you're describing - being a ""robot"" - is your mind's way of protecting itself. But suppressing emotions usually backfires in the long run. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you process these feelings in a safe space without burdening your family.

Remember that feeling lost and uncertain in your 20s isn't a failure - it's completely normal. You're not broken, you're just human. Be gentle with yourself. Focus on small steps forward rather than having it all figured out at once.

Your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in this struggle. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.
Thank you for reading.
Any helpful tips to deal would be appreciated.
I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

Edit: seriously so thankful you all have been leaving so many nice comments :') (and even gave me a gold?? Thank you!) I may not respond to everyone but I am surely reading every comment and am beyond appreciative!",940,126,1591419082,"People don‚Äôt understand how exhausting , irritating, and scary anxiety can be. I‚Äôm glad we have this platform to connect and write how we feel without judgement. You are not alone. I‚Äôm going to list a few things that help me and I hope you can try. 

1. Peppermint oil. (Roller ball form sold at target for 4.99) put it directly on temples, neck wrist. I love to roll on tissue and smell. The scent really does soothe and calms me down. I can‚Äôt be without. 

2. Finding a game on your phone or YouTube videos on something you like that can distract you. Have a list of saved videos you can watch when you are feeling a panic. 

3. Ice pack. I put one on my neck or just hold it the sensation helps to calm. 

4. Staying hydrated. Drinking cold water when I‚Äôm feeling anxious also helps a little. 

5. Fresh air. If I‚Äôm too anxious for a walk I will sit on my balcony, and listen to music/ play a distracting game on my phone.

6. Creating a list of things you need to do. Example cleaning or organizing a closet or drawer etc to keep busy. Even simply washing the Dishes.",312,melg6,"Hey, man. I get it. I deactivated all of my social media except youtube and reddit, but cleaned up youtube and reddit so I don‚Äôt have to see or hear about current events or my friends‚Äô/loved ones‚Äô shitty opinions on current events. I also deleted all my news apps except for My Radar so I can get the weather without everything else.

Still, I‚Äôm extremely stressed out. For this whole week (since Saturday evening), my heart has been racing between 120-160 bpm. I‚Äôve been feeling cold and in need of a thick hoodie and fluffy socks, even though it‚Äôs been between 80-90 degrees F this whole week. I haven‚Äôt slept or eaten. Only tonight have I been able to eat a small meal and a snack. I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of endless ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù and worst case scenarios. It sucks. It really fucking sucks. And, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the same.

I hope it‚Äôs comforting to know that you are far from alone. I know people who never understood what it was like to be anxious until now, when recent events have pushed them over the edge. My dad, perhaps the most stoic, level-headed, intelligent man I know, had a mental breakdown earlier this week and told me about it when I saw him Thursday, and opened up about my experiences. My mom has been a constant ball of anxiety. My grandparents have been full of anxiety. My friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc are full of anxiety. Everyone is losing their fucking minds. 

So, I think it‚Äôs wise to unplug, at least until the weather appears on the front page of the news sites again. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get back to social media shit. If I do, I‚Äôll be coming back in a completely different way. 

It‚Äôs perfectly okay to unplug. It‚Äôs the most commendable thing you can do these days. Sure, some people may get upset at you. But, for the most part, it will be like you never existed online in the first place. So, take care of yourself. Don‚Äôt do what I did, and stay plugged in until you can‚Äôt eat or sleep for five days. Instead, surround yourself with positivity.

Beyond deactivating social media and ignoring the news, get back into a hobby or two. Listen to your favorite music. Work on some art. Read some good books. Listen to some uplifting podcasts. Watch interesting and funny movies. Go for long walks outside. Lift some weights. Learn new things about something you‚Äôve always wanted to know more about. Talk to loved ones over the phone, over skype, and/or in person (if it‚Äôs possible). Get a therapist (if you don‚Äôt already have one). Do whatever you need to do to make it possible to heal.

Healing will take a long time. It won‚Äôt be easy. But, I promise it will get better! Keep on going! With time, you will heal, your friends and family will heal, society will heal, and everything will get back to normal.

We‚Äôre already almost through the first week of June! Woohoo!",95,camohorse,"Hey there, I can feel the anxiety and panic spiraling through your words, and I want you to know you're not alone in this. What you're experiencing sounds absolutely overwhelming, and it's completely okay to reach out like this - it's actually really brave.

Have you tried any grounding techniques? When I'm in that spiral, I use the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. It helps bring you back to the present moment when your thoughts are exploding.

The way you're twisting positive interactions into negatives - that's anxiety talking, not reality. It's like wearing glasses that distort everything, but those glasses aren't showing you the truth. 

Writing this out was definitely the right choice - it's a healthy way to release these feelings instead of letting them bounce around in your head. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can give you more tools to handle these moments.

Hang in there. This feeling won't last forever, even though it feels endless right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Suddenly the small things is very big and it keeps growing in your head, and trying to escape from under skin.

Which makes it even more frustrating.",131,Rosemary-Slavic,,0,,"I feel this so deeply. That's exactly what makes anxiety so frustrating - the rational part of your brain is screaming ""this isn't a big deal!"" while your anxiety is turning it into this overwhelming monster that you can't shake off.

Please know that you're not being ridiculous. Anxiety disorders are real medical conditions that affect how our brains process stress and threats. It's not a character flaw or a choice - it's your brain's alarm system being oversensitive.

Something that's helped me is acknowledging both sides: ""My anxiety is telling me this is huge, but I know it's probably not. Both feelings can exist at once."" This helps me avoid the extra layer of beating myself up about having anxiety in the first place.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can teach you specific techniques to help manage those moments when small things start spiraling. You don't have to figure this out alone.

Sending you support. Anxiety is exhausting, but you're stronger than you think. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

You can defeat it by removing either the anxiety or the idleness.",84,phillipsheadhammers,"I totally get this cycle - it's like being stuck in a negative feedback loop where each part feeds into the next. The anxiety leads to procrastination, which leads to guilt, which creates more anxiety... and round and round we go.

First, be kind to yourself. This pattern is incredibly common and doesn't make you a failure. The fact that you can identify this cycle is actually a really important first step.

Something that's helped me break this pattern is starting ridiculously small. Like, almost laughably small. Instead of ""I need to complete this whole project,"" try ""I'll work on this for just 5 minutes."" Often, once you start, it's easier to continue. And if you only do 5 minutes? That's still a win.

Also, congrats on signing up for the gym! That's a perfect example of taking action despite anxiety. Each small win helps build confidence and weakens that voice saying ""what's the point?""

Remember: You haven't lost control - you're just in a pattern that can be changed, one tiny step at a time.","

I got fired for taking one. It didn‚Äôt count as being sick but I didn‚Äôt want to lie so I told them my anxiety/depression was flaring up really badly and I needed a mental health day, she fired me the next day. I‚Äôll never do that again. I‚Äôll always say I‚Äôm sick.

Mental health days are just as important as sick days for physical illness, and it's so refreshing to see more workplaces acknowledging this. The fact that your supervisor called to check on you shows they really care about their employees' wellbeing.

Don't feel guilty about taking this time for yourself - you're actually being a responsible employee by recognizing when you need to recharge. Burnout helps no one, and coming back refreshed will make you more productive in the long run.

If you're comfortable, you might want to thank your supervisor for being so understanding. It encourages this kind of positive workplace culture and might make it easier for others to be open about their mental health needs too.

Hope you're using this day to truly rest and do whatever helps you reset. Whether that's sleeping in, going for a walk, or just watching Netflix in your PJs - you deserve this break! üíú","

The way these conditions feed into each other and chip away at your sense of self-worth is absolutely brutal. It's like being stuck in a cycle where anxiety makes you doubt yourself, ADHD makes it hard to follow through on things, and depression tells you it's all your fault.

But please remember - your struggles don't define your worth. These are medical conditions that affect your brain chemistry, not character flaws or personal failures. Just like you wouldn't blame someone for having asthma or diabetes, you shouldn't blame yourself for these challenges.

Something that helped me was working with both a therapist AND a psychiatrist to tackle things from multiple angles. Also, finding communities (like this one) where others understand what you're going through can be incredibly validating.

You're fighting an invisible battle every day, and that takes incredible strength - even if it doesn't always feel that way. Your self-esteem may be wounded right now, but it's not permanently destroyed. With the right support and treatment, it can and will get better. Sending you strength. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Many things I don't really know what to do with. Hobby stuff from parents, old school books etc....they saved too many things. I also have several projects started but never finished.

There is a lot of nostalgia attached to these items, so they also feel comforting in a way.

The mental weight of unfinished projects and sentimental items can definitely contribute to anxiety - it's like each item is a little task or emotional obligation sitting there in your space.

What helped me was starting really small. Pick one category (like old school books) and sort for just 15 minutes. Take photos of especially meaningful items before donating them - this helps preserve the memory without keeping the physical object. For unfinished projects, either commit to completing one specific project or give yourself permission to let it go.

The key is recognizing that letting go of objects doesn't mean letting go of the memories or emotions attached to them. Your connection to your parents isn't in their old hobby supplies - it's in your heart and memories.

I noticed a huge difference in my anxiety levels once I cleared my space. It's like each item I removed lifted a tiny weight off my shoulders. Just walking into a clearer space feels lighter and more peaceful. Take it slow, be gentle with yourself, and remember you don't have to tackle everything at once.","

88rtze,Anxiety,Anybody else get anxiety when someone yells at you or gets annoyed by you?,AriaMN,I would be doing something and I would do it wrong then my friend would just start getting annoyed and it gives my big time anxiety. Or when I annoy one of my friends unintentionally they yell and that even gives me a larger amount of anxiety. Moody people in general give me anxiety.,964,99,1522598778,"Yeah. Even over the internet, when I'm in a discussion and someone starts arguing with me it ruins my day. I've just had a hard time participating with reddit and gaming in the last few months, it feels like everyone has gotten so toxic and I completely shut down when people start having a go at me. Makes it hard to enjoy doing anything when I'm always worried about the potential of being berated when I try to talk online. ",244,Afbg123,Definitely get it when people raise their voices (think thats kind of similar to what you're describing?) - even if im just in the same room and they just raise their voice. For me its the unexpected loud noises! (which to a certain extent is a pretty normal reaction I think? - just not still thinking about it several hours later) Could be kind of similar to what you're talking about?,19,RemarkableChocolate,"Yes, this is completely normal and valid! I struggle with this too. That pit-in-your-stomach feeling when someone shows frustration or anger towards you can be really overwhelming, especially when you didn't mean to upset them.

One thing that's helped me is reminding myself that other people's reactions are often more about their own stress/mood than about me. If a friend snaps over something minor, they might be dealing with other issues I don't know about. That said, it's also okay to set boundaries - true friends should be able to express frustration without yelling or making you feel awful.

Maybe try having an honest conversation with your friends when everyone is calm. Let them know how their reactions affect you. Something like ""Hey, I know I can be frustrating sometimes, but when you yell it really increases my anxiety. Could we find a better way to communicate?""

Remember that you deserve to feel safe and respected in your friendships. Your anxiety around conflict is understandable, but you shouldn't have to constantly walk on eggshells around your friends. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Reddit can feel really intimidating sometimes, like everyone else is an expert and you're worried about saying the ""wrong"" thing. But you know what? Most users are just regular people sharing their thoughts, and plenty feel the same anxiety you do.

Start small - maybe find some supportive communities about things you're passionate about. Pet subreddits are usually super wholesome, or hobby-focused ones where people are excited to welcome newcomers. You don't have to make huge posts - even simple comments like ""cute cat!"" or ""thanks for sharing this tip"" are perfectly valid contributions.

And here's a secret: that post you're hesitating to share? Someone out there probably needs to hear exactly what you have to say. Your perspective is unique and valuable, even if it doesn't feel that way.

Look at this post - you were brave enough to share these feelings, and people related to it so much someone gave you gold! That's proof you're not alone in feeling this way. Take it one comment at a time, no pressure. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Congratulations on not just surviving, but building such a beautiful life for yourself. You've overcome incredible challenges, found love, watched your children grow, and found fulfilling work. Each of those is an achievement worth celebrating.

Keep it up, there‚Äôs a whole world waiting for you!",104,hurleyhotpocket,"This is HUGE! As someone who understands anxiety, I know that what you just accomplished isn't just ""going to Home Depot"" - it's facing multiple intense fears all at once. Traffic lights, crowds, unfamiliar spaces... each of these can be overwhelming on their own, and you tackled them all!

The fact that you pushed through even when you ""almost lost it"" shows incredible strength. That's exactly how progress happens - not by being fearless, but by feeling the fear and taking those steps anyway.

Please remember this victory. On harder days, you can look back and remind yourself ""I did that. I made it through."" Each success, no matter how small it might seem to others, is proof that you're capable of more than your anxiety wants you to believe.

Be proud of yourself - this internet stranger certainly is! And remember to be gentle with yourself as you continue this journey. Progress isn't always linear, but today shows you're moving in the right direction. üåü","

wrus19,Anxiety,My wife tried to kill herself.,masteroguitar,"Last Monday I walked in on my wife taking an excessive amount of very dangerous heart pills. And somehow I was too stupid to realize she wasn‚Äôt joking, she wanted to die. Luckily she was talking to her therapist who made her a Safety plan that I thought was a great idea. I got rid of all the guns in the house, all the pills and all was well. About 4 days later she admitted she had picked a day, a time, and how she was going to do it. Which was yesterday at 9 in the morning with about 150 pills she had hid from me. A few phone calls later she was whisked away to a crisis center. 

Now she‚Äôs gone for I don‚Äôt know how long, no visitors allowed and very little phone contact. 

Since the incident. I haven‚Äôt eaten in 4 days, I have constant panic attacks it almost feels like she did Die, I know it‚Äôs not true and she‚Äôs safe but I‚Äôm so lost I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I‚Äôve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don‚Äôt understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

Update: I want to thank every single one of you that has wrote something for me, it makes me feel so much better knowing someone took time out of their day to give advise or encouragement. As of right now I‚Äôm at my sisters house, it‚Äôs a lot better having an adult to talk to.

I‚Äôve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can‚Äôt see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She‚Äôs doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

It's completely normal to feel devastated and anxious when someone you love attempts suicide - you're not ""messed up"" for having such an intense reaction. This is a crisis for both of you.

Please know that your wife being in a crisis center is the safest place for her right now. They have the expertise to help her, even though the separation is incredibly hard. I'm glad you're taking care of yourself by getting medical help and staying with your sister. Having support is crucial.

Give the medications some time to work - they usually take a few weeks to reach full effectiveness. In the meantime, try to maintain basic self-care: eat small meals even if you don't feel hungry, get some rest when you can, and keep talking to supportive people.

Consider finding a therapist for yourself to help process this trauma. This is a lot to handle alone, and you deserve support too. Many people who love someone with suicidal thoughts benefit from professional help.

That constant ""what if THIS is the time I'm actually dying?"" thought pattern is exhausting.

Something that helped me was learning that anxiety literally cannot kill you - it's just your body's ancient survival system being overprotective. Like an overzealous security guard that tackles every shadow. Super annoying, but not dangerous.

Have you looked into therapy? CBT specifically helped me recognize these thoughts as anxiety rather than reality. Still get those moments, but they don't spiral as badly anymore.

In the meantime, remember you're not alone in this. Anxiety is a lying jerk that makes everything feel scarier than it is. You've survived 100% of your anxiety attacks so far - that's proof your brain is wrong about the whole ""definitely dying"" thing.

I used to be an extrovert, now I get overwhelmed by texting.",7,misswyatt,"I totally get this - anxiety can be completely draining, and when you're already running on empty, even basic social interactions can feel overwhelming. It's like your battery is constantly at 10% and every conversation takes way more energy than you have to give.

Have you considered trying ""social snacking"" - very short, controlled interactions to slowly rebuild your tolerance? Like a 15-minute coffee with one friend, or a quick video call. This helped me when I was in a similar place. You can leave whenever you need to, which makes it feel more manageable.

Also, while therapy is great, sometimes you need to try different therapists or approaches before finding what clicks. It might be worth discussing with your therapist specifically how anxiety is affecting your energy levels and social tolerance, rather than focusing on traditional social anxiety treatment.

Don't be too hard on yourself. This is a really common effect of anxiety, and it doesn't mean you'll be this way forever. Your body and mind are probably just trying to protect you by conserving energy. Take it slow, be patient with yourself, and remember that it's okay to set boundaries while you heal.","

(Not voluntarily) I lost about 20lbs because everytime I ate i threw up. It came to a point that I would worry so much about not holding food down that I panicked and would throw up from worrying.

Anxiety can really F up your digestive system in so many ways.,1,Pebbles430,"I've absolutely been there, and what you're describing is a really common anxiety symptom that creates a frustrating cycle. The anxiety causes digestive issues, which then causes more anxiety about eating, which then makes the symptoms worse, and so on.

I went through something similar last year - the bloating, the fear of meals, the weight loss. What helped me was:
- Starting with small, frequent meals instead of trying to force down big ones
- Sticking to easily digestible foods when symptoms were bad
- Deep breathing exercises before eating
- Reminding myself that anxiety can 100% cause all these physical symptoms

While your doctor's assessment about anxiety being the cause makes sense, I know how hard it is to shake that worry. Have you considered seeing a therapist who specializes in health anxiety? They can give you specific tools to break this cycle.

Just know you're not alone in this. Anxiety can do weird things to our bodies, but with the right support and coping strategies, it does get better. Be gentle with yourself while you work through this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

That feeling of being trapped in your own head while simultaneously wanting to escape from it is something many of us know all too well.

I've found that one of the most powerful realizations is that anxiety lies to us. It tells us we're alone in this, but posts like yours remind us that so many others understand exactly what we're going through. Those physical symptoms and behavioral patterns you described - from the leg shaking to stress eating to isolation - they're all such common experiences with anxiety.

Something that's helped me is treating these symptoms as signals rather than failures. When I notice them, I try to pause and ask ""What is my anxiety trying to tell me right now?"" It doesn't always fix things, but it helps me be a bit gentler with myself.

Sending that hug right back to you. Keep reaching out - whether it's here, to friends, or to a mental health professional. You're fighting a tough battle, but you don't have to fight it alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I've been there too, where the anxiety gets so intense that you start questioning your grip on reality. The fear of ""going crazy"" is actually a really typical anxiety symptom, which is somewhat ironic because being worried about your sanity usually means you're quite sane.

Something that helped me was learning that these thoughts are just anxiety playing tricks on you. Your mind is working perfectly fine - it's just in a heightened state of alert. Think of it like an oversensitive car alarm that goes off at the slightest touch. Annoying, but not dangerous.

If you're not already seeing someone, talking to a mental health professional can be really helpful. They can teach you specific techniques to manage these thoughts when they get overwhelming. In the meantime, remember that millions of people experience this exact same fear. You're not losing your mind - you're just dealing with anxiety, and that's something that can definitely be managed with the right support.

Stay strong! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

POST TITLE: Does anyone ever start fearing for their sanity when anxiety gets unbearable?

POST BODY: My biggest fear with my anxiety is losing my mind. Not being in control or going mad is the scariest possible scenario to me. Does anyone else feel this way?

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out, it‚Äôs comforting to know there are others who experience the same stuff, makes it less terrifying!! I am also so happy others can find reassurance through these comments so thank you all!! &lt;3

Self-checkout has been such a game-changer for those late-night grocery runs when you just want to grab your stuff and go without small talk. There's something so peaceful about wandering through a quiet store at 11 PM and being able to check out at your own pace.

Pro tip though - if you're going this late, double-check your store's self-checkout hours. Some places switch to cashier-only after a certain time. Nothing worse than filling your cart only to discover the self-checkout lanes are closed! 

And don't feel bad about preferring this option - it doesn't make you antisocial. Sometimes you just want to buy your ice cream and midnight snacks without explaining your life story to anyone. Self-checkout is perfect for those moments when you want to be in your own little bubble.

Happy late-night shopping! üåô","

gq9gsh,Anxiety,"Do you ever say, ""Okay, Let's start doing ____"" and then just, literally wait for yourself to move?",Normal-Anxious,"It's just.. I dont know. I was so prepared to do something, and when I wanted to start, I literally just waited. Soon, I ended up getting anxious, lol. Like, I can't make an action for myself.

Edit: I'm so freakin glad to be able to relate to yall! I really thought it was only me.",996,62,1590406502,"I seem to get this before I even decide on what I'm doing. I spend too long agonising over what I'm going to do that by the time I decide, it's too late. :/",94,jaffa_kree_66,"I can absolutely relate to this. In my case, I often felt very overwhelmed because of the number of tasks in front of me, so every little bits of motivation ended up being suppressed by my anxiety.

I saw a therapist for a bit, and one thing she said really stuck with me: ""Actions precedes emotions."" Essentially, nobody has ever felt anything positive about tasks to come. You really need to give yourself a good kick in the butt to get started. Super hard at first, but after a while I find that you manage to do it more and more, and it can be really satisfying. 

So I guess you could try to ignore those feelings and get started, and see where it gets you. It's a journey, sometimes it feels being proactive, sometimes it feels like it's the last thing you want to do. One thing's for sure though, it's that it gets easier. 

Hope that helps a bit.",69,qwasvo,"Oh my god, YES. This happens to me all the time and it's so frustrating! It's like your brain is ready but your body just... won't... move. I've literally sat there telling myself ""okay, get up and do the dishes"" for 30 minutes while just staring at my phone.

What helps me break this weird paralysis is using the ""5-4-3-2-1"" method. Instead of waiting for motivation, I count down from 5 and force myself to move at ""1"" - no thinking allowed. It sounds silly but it works because it bypasses that overthinking loop we get stuck in.

Another trick is to make the first step ridiculously small. Don't say ""I'm going to clean the kitchen"" - say ""I'm going to put ONE dish in the sink."" Usually once you're up and moving, it's easier to keep going.

Don't beat yourself up about it though - this is super common and definitely not just you. Our brains are weird sometimes! üíú","

c4falr,Anxiety,"""A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears""",parrbird88,After reading this quote many times it made me rethink my anxiety and take a new perspective. Hopefully the insight will inspire you as well.,1002,53,1561335867,Very good ! Where is this from ?,50,bongsmasher,Very good ! Where is this from ?,50,bongsmasher,"This quote really resonates with me. It perfectly captures how anxiety can create this self-fulfilling cycle where the fear of something becomes almost as impactful as the thing itself. I've struggled with this too - spending so much mental energy worrying about potential problems that I was actually making myself miserable in the present moment.

What helped me was realizing that by fixating on what *might* happen, I was essentially experiencing the negative emotions twice - once in anticipation and again if it actually happened. Learning to catch myself in these anxiety spirals and asking ""Am I suffering now because of something real, or because of something that may never happen?"" has been a game-changer.

It's not about completely eliminating fear or anxiety (that's probably impossible), but rather about not letting the fear of future suffering steal our present peace. Easier said than done, of course, but awareness is the first step.

Thanks for sharing this perspective - it's a powerful reminder that sometimes our attempts to avoid pain can become a source of pain themselves.","

o0ovub,Anxiety,I quit my six-figure job to recover,hnrei,"This was possibly the hardest decision I‚Äôve ever had to make. I‚Äôve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn‚Äôt stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn‚Äôt taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I‚Äôm a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don‚Äôt have a fully laid out plan of what I‚Äôm going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.",916,138,1623791983,"Glad you have changed path. Sounds like the job was not right for you. You made a hard decision. I‚Äôm proud of you.

The fact that you were crying multiple times a day and couldn't eat properly were clear signs your body and mind were screaming for help.

I've been in a similar situation where I felt like quitting would make me a ""failure,"" but here's the truth: Recognizing when something is harmful to your wellbeing and taking steps to protect yourself isn't weakness - it's wisdom. You're not a quitter; you're someone who values their health and knows their limits.

It's great that you're already taking small steps like morning runs and that you have a supportive partner. Focus on healing right now - the job market will always be there when you're ready to return. And when you do look for your next opportunity, you'll have a much better understanding of what kind of work environment and workload actually works for you.

Take care of yourself, and be proud that you had the courage to make this difficult but necessary decision.","

koyzrv,Anxiety,Anyone else feel a need to just get away from their life?,TheWesternWitcher,"Not just in the sense of stay at home in bed but to actually get out and find an ideal looking wilderness to just stay in. No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

I've suffered with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety and Depression for most of my life and have always felt more at peace and happier when out in the wilderness and cut off from everybody else.",977,77,1609600236,"Yes. This sounds idyllic. A couple of years ago I rented an air bnb in Scotland, miles from anywhere. I remember lying on the sofa and feeling at peace. It made me realise that I hadn't felt like that for decades.",111,demoralising,[deleted],1,[deleted],"I totally get this feeling. That yearning for escape into nature isn't just about running away - it's about finding a space where you can truly breathe and be yourself without the constant social pressure and expectations that modern life puts on us. Especially when dealing with anxiety and depression, the simplicity and peace of the wilderness can feel like such a relief.

While building a cabin in the woods might not be immediately practical, have you considered taking small steps in that direction? Maybe start with weekend camping trips or renting a remote cabin for a few days? It could give you those moments of peace while still maintaining the stability you need.

I've found that even short nature retreats can help reset my mental state when everything gets overwhelming. Plus, they're a great way to test out if that lifestyle is really what you're looking for long-term.

Just remember - wanting to disconnect from the chaos isn't weird or wrong. It's a pretty natural response to the overwhelming world we live in. Be gentle with yourself as you figure out the right balance between solitude and society.","

The fact that you not only placed the order but did it confidently (no quiet voice or stuttering) shows real progress. These small victories build on each other and help create positive experiences to look back on next time you're feeling anxious.

Keep challenging yourself at your own pace. Maybe next time you'll feel comfortable enough to make small talk with the sandwich artist, or try ordering during a busier time. But even if you just keep nailing the basic orders like today, that's perfectly fine too. You're doing great! üéâ","

mmmr2i,Anxiety,I ate after 5 days.,mxlapxta,"I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) &amp; it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

Emetophobia can be absolutely debilitating, and the fact that you pushed through and managed to eat something after 5 days is a huge accomplishment. Starting small with familiar foods was a really smart approach.

It's wonderful to hear how the medication has helped you feel like yourself again. That feeling of being able to eat without the constant anxiety and physical symptoms must be such a relief. The return of singing, music, and socializing are beautiful signs that you're getting back to the things that bring you joy.

Keep celebrating these victories, no matter how small they might seem to others. Recovery isn't always linear, so be patient with yourself on harder days. Having support from your doctor and family (like your mum bringing KFC) can make such a difference.

It's called an ""inner monologue"" or ""internal dialogue,"" and while some people have it, others don't - both are completely normal variations in how humans think.

I can relate to what you're saying about having different ""voices"" or parts of yourself in there. The supportive voice that helps talk you down from anxiety is a great coping mechanism. As for those intrusive negative thoughts - they're super common with anxiety, and it's actually really healthy that you recognize them as separate from your ""true self.""

One thing that might help is learning about Internal Family Systems therapy - it's based on the idea that we all have different ""parts"" of ourselves, and it teaches you how to work with them productively. The fact that you can already distinguish between your supportive voice and those intrusive thoughts puts you ahead of the game!

Don't worry - you're not crazy for having these internal conversations. It's just your brain's way of processing thoughts and emotions, and it sounds like you're using it in healthy ways to manage your anxiety.","

What you're describing is actually pretty common - our bodies and emotions have their own timing, and sometimes when we ""postpone"" an emotional release, it's like the moment passes and we can't access those feelings in quite the same way later.

It's great that you were able to keep your composure when you needed to, but don't feel bad about not being able to cry later. Sometimes emotional exhaustion can leave us feeling numb or too tired to process things fully. The feelings are still valid and there, even if the tears aren't coming.

Maybe try giving yourself some gentle space to process what happened - whether that's journaling, taking a warm shower, or just sitting quietly with your feelings. The release might come naturally later, or it might not, and both are okay. The important thing is to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that what happened affected you, tears or no tears.

Remember, there's no ""right"" way to process difficult emotions. Your body and mind will find their own way to deal with it when they're ready. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

k5xlxc,Anxiety,Does anyone else preemptively 'mourn' the loss of your family?,rougethebatt,"My obsession with death is always just me trying to cope with the idea of losing any member of my family.

Late at night, I find myself thinking of losing my husband or son and I 'grieve' for hours. Sometimes I think of my own death and cry too-- not because of being afraid of death but because I don't want to leave my family behind. The idea that life is so fragile and one day things can drastically change scares me so much. I saw this happen to my brother in law who died from colon cancer. I'm so scared of our lives turning on a dime like that.

I used to be like this as a kid too-- but with my parents. Somehow this obsession is much worse now with my own tiny family.",935,116,1607003702,"I do it a lot. Unfortunately I lost my mom, I was grieving her before she past away (but when I already knew she was sick). And after it happened, I realized I regret doing it so much. Grieve is the hardest thing I've ever did and I wish I didn't do it before, I should have enjoyed the thought of having her instead",136,karo_96,This sounds almost like a specific kind of OCD. Have you been to a psychologist/psychiatrist?,2,SheruBeeLee,"I completely understand these feelings. I've experienced similar late-night spirals thinking about losing my loved ones, and it can be really overwhelming. It's especially hard when you've personally witnessed loss, like with your brother-in-law - it makes the possibility feel so much more real.

What helped me was realizing that these thoughts, while difficult, come from a place of deep love. You're experiencing these feelings because you cherish your family so intensely. However, when these thoughts start interfering with your ability to enjoy the present moment with them, it might be worth talking to a therapist. They can help provide healthy coping strategies for managing death anxiety.

Try to gently redirect these thoughts toward appreciating the time you have now. Maybe channel that energy into creating more memories, taking photos, or writing letters to your family. It won't make the fear go away completely, but it can help transform some of that anxiety into meaningful actions.

Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. It's a very human response to loving deeply.","

Well done!

It's totally normal to replay the conversation in your head afterwards and feel a bit wound up about it. Just remember you had every right to make this reasonable request after 3 months of disrupted sleep.

If the noise continues, consider keeping a log of dates/times and maybe recording some audio clips. That way if you need to escalate to property management, you'll have documentation. But hopefully he'll be considerate now that you've brought it to his attention - most people don't realize how much their voice carries through walls.

Try to focus on the fact that you advocated for yourself today rather than second-guessing how the conversation went. That's real personal growth right there. Maybe do some relaxing activities before bed tonight to help calm those post-confrontation jitters. You've got this!","

That asthma joke made me chuckle cuz I do have asthma and anxiety ha!",123,PositivelyPrune,,0,,"I love that analogy about asthma - it perfectly captures how frustrating it is when people oversimplify mental health struggles. While they might mean well with the ""just think positive"" advice, mental illness is a real medical condition, not just a bad mood you can snap out of.

As someone who's dealt with anxiety and panic attacks, I know how isolating it feels when others dismiss your experience. Those who haven't experienced a panic attack can't understand how it physically and mentally paralyzes you, no matter how much ""free air"" there is to breathe.

The good news is that society's understanding of mental health is slowly improving. More people are speaking up, like you're doing now. While positive thinking and self-care activities can be helpful tools as part of broader treatment, they're not a cure-all. Real treatment usually involves professional help, possibly medication, and a lot of patience and self-compassion.

Keep advocating for mental health awareness. Your voice matters in helping others understand that mental illness deserves the same respect and medical attention as physical conditions.","

You are human and you have anxiety. It is perfectly okay to cry. A good strategy to use in situations like these it to think about another person who made the same mistake etc. as you. Would you be as upset with them as you are with yourself? Would you want them to hurt themselves? Hell no. You deserve the same compassion, forgiveness, and understanding as everyone else. Good luck and stay strong :) P.S. never hurt yourself, it only makes everything worse.",19,ndm2701,"Yes, I absolutely relate to this and want you to know you're not alone. Being highly sensitive to criticism is actually really common, even if people don't talk about it openly. I used to (and sometimes still do) have the exact same reaction - keeping it together in the moment but breaking down afterwards.

Something that's helped me is reminding myself that my emotional reaction and my professional capabilities are two separate things. Having a big emotional response doesn't make you less competent or professional - it just means you care deeply about doing well, which is actually a good quality.

A few practical tips that help me:
- Take a quick walk or bathroom break to reset
- Write down what happened objectively to separate facts from emotions
- Remind yourself that your boss likely won't even remember this in a week
- Focus on what you can learn from the mistake rather than beating yourself up

Also, please be gentle with yourself regarding those self-harm thoughts. If those come up frequently, talking to a counselor can really help develop better coping strategies. There's no shame in being sensitive - we just need to learn how to handle it constructively.","

For me, it helped to:
1. Turn off notification previews so I only see who messaged, not the content
2. Set boundaries by letting close friends/family know I might not respond right away
3. Mute non-urgent group chats or chatty friends who send multiple texts

And yes, the multiple-text-bombardment thing is totally anxiety-inducing! It's like each new bubble adds more pressure to respond.

Remember: You're not being overly sensitive. It's a valid feeling, and you get to manage your social energy in whatever way works best for you. Some people are just more sensitive to social stimuli, and that's perfectly okay. Maybe try explaining to your closest contacts that you prefer single, consolidated messages - most people will understand and adjust.","

bjjn70,Anxiety,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...,piercingjoy," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone &lt;3

I actually just followed your steps and realized how tense I was holding my body - especially my jaw! It's amazing how we carry stress without even noticing it.

I particularly love the suggestion about keeping a small printed list in your wallet. I'm going to do this today. Sometimes when we're overwhelmed, our minds go blank and we forget even the simplest self-care strategies that usually help us.

One small thing I'd add - if anyone finds it hard to do the breathing exercises at first, try counting during the breaths (4 counts in, hold for 4, 6 counts out). Having something specific to focus on can make it easier to stay present.

Thanks for taking the time to share such detailed, practical steps. Posts like this are a wonderful reminder that we're all human, all dealing with similar struggles, and all capable of helping each other through them. Saving this for future reference! üíú","

That constant mental replay of every interaction, analyzing every word you said or might have said wrong, lying awake wondering if people are secretly mad at you... it's absolutely draining. Like having a browser with 100 tabs open in your mind, all playing anxiety at full volume.

I've found that working with a therapist helped me develop better tools to manage these thoughts. One thing that really helped me was learning to challenge those anxious thoughts with ""what's the evidence?"" When I start spiraling about a conversation, I try to ask myself what actual proof I have that it went badly, versus what my anxiety is making up.

It's not a quick fix, and some days are still really hard. But please know you're not alone in this. Anxiety lies to us and makes everything feel so much heavier than it needs to be. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you haven't already - having someone help you develop coping strategies can make a huge difference in managing those racing thoughts.

Good luck!",62,redcdr,[deleted],12,[deleted],"Congratulations on taking this huge step! It's completely normal to feel both excited and anxious about starting therapy - those mixed feelings are actually a good sign that you're taking this seriously.

From my experience, the first few sessions are usually about building rapport with your therapist and giving them a general overview of what brought you there. Don't feel pressured to share everything right away - go at your pace. Some sessions will feel really productive, others might feel less so, and that's totally normal.

One tip: Consider keeping brief notes after each session about things you want to remember or discuss next time. Social anxiety topics can sometimes feel overwhelming in the moment, and it's easy to forget important points you wanted to bring up.

And hey, about that anxiety with posting - that's totally relatable! Recovery isn't linear, and it's okay to still feel anxious about some things while making progress in others. You're already showing courage by reaching out here.

I dealt with the same thing for years - that horrible knot in your stomach that makes you feel physically sick. Sometimes anxiety can manifest physically even when we can't pinpoint the exact mental trigger.

A few things that helped me:
- Deep breathing exercises, especially first thing in the morning
- Ginger tea or peppermint tea to settle the stomach
- Getting outside for a short walk when the feeling hits
- Keeping small snacks handy (an empty stomach can make it worse)

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you identify anxiety triggers you might not be consciously aware of. Sometimes our bodies pick up on stress before our minds do.

In the meantime, please be gentle with yourself. This is a really common anxiety symptom, even though it feels awful and isolating. You're not broken or weird for experiencing this. Sending you strength - I know how rough this can be to deal with daily. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It's like being caught between two opposing needs, and neither situation feels comfortable. What you're experiencing with the selective muteness and feeling robotic in social situations sounds a lot like social anxiety.

Have you considered starting really small with social interactions? Maybe one-on-one meetings with people you trust, in environments where you feel safe and can easily leave if needed. This can help build your social ""muscles"" without overwhelming yourself.

As for enjoying alone time, try reframing it as self-discovery rather than isolation. Start with activities that are engaging enough to keep your mind occupied but don't require social interaction - maybe reading, drawing, or learning a new skill. The goal is to gradually become more comfortable in your own company.

POST TITLE: When I am around people I yearn to escape, when I am alone I yearn for connections. I am never at peace

POST BODY: When alone I really feel lonely and I am unable to truly enjoy being alone. I wish I could but I don't. I yearn for connection. When I am around people I freak out, have adrenaline sometimes, become selectively mute without a choice and feel robotic in my speech and movements and need to escape. So here I am. Alone. Wishing I could relax and at least enjoy my own company

It doesn't fix everything, but it gives my brain a little positive anchor point.

Also, I try to remind myself that 99% of the time, Monday itself is never as bad as Sunday-night-me imagines it will be. Our anxiety builds it up to be this monster, but usually it's just... a regular day.

It's an exhausting cycle.

Here's something that helped me: Most people are way too caught up in their own lives and insecurities to be secretly judging us. And true friends understand that sometimes we get anxious or need space - they don't hate us for it.

Have you considered being honest with a close friend about these feelings? Something like ""Hey, sometimes I get really anxious about our friendship and withdraw, but it's not because I don't value you."" In my experience, opening up about these fears often brings people closer.

You're not alone in feeling this way. Social anxiety and friendship anxiety are super common, even if people don't talk about it much. Consider talking to a therapist if these thoughts are really impacting your relationships - they can help give you tools to break this cycle.

Just remember: Your anxiety is lying to you. You deserve friendships and connection just as much as anyone else.","

When we're used to constant stress and problems, periods of calm can feel really unsettling - almost like waiting for the other shoe to drop.

What you're describing sounds like anxiety manifesting as hypervigilance - your mind is constantly scanning for potential threats because it's not used to everything being okay. The good news is that this is something you can work on! 

Try to practice mindfulness and really allow yourself to exist in these good moments. When anxious thoughts come up, acknowledge them but remind yourself that right now, in this moment, things are actually okay. You deserve this period of peace!

If these thoughts are significantly impacting your sleep and daily life, it might be worth talking to a therapist. They can help you develop tools to manage these fears and learn to feel more comfortable with positive periods in your life.

Looking back at times when anxiety had me constantly seeking reassurance makes me want to crawl under a rock too.

We're all works in progress, and those cringey memories actually show how far you've come. The fact that you can recognize those patterns now means you've grown and learned better ways to handle anxiety. That's something to be proud of, not ashamed of.

Most people have their own ""anxiety highlight reel"" they'd rather forget. The friends who stuck by you during those times probably understand more than you think - everyone has needed support at some point.

Instead of letting those memories push you toward isolation, try to be gentle with your past self. You were going through something really tough, and you survived it. That's what matters.","

It's like your head is floating and disconnected from your body, right? For me, it often comes with this weird sensation of unreality that makes everything feel off-balance.

Something that's helped me manage those dizzy spells is focusing on physical grounding techniques. I'll plant my feet firmly on the floor and slowly count 5 things I can feel (like the texture of my clothes or the chair I'm sitting in). It helps bring me back to my body when everything feels spinny.

Deep belly breathing helps too - putting one hand on your chest and one on your stomach, then focusing on making your stomach hand rise more than your chest hand. It sounds simple but it can help steady that tornado feeling.

Just remember you're not alone in this. Anxiety manifests in so many physical ways and that lightheaded feeling, while scary, is a common symptom that many of us deal with. Have you talked to a healthcare provider about it? They might have some additional strategies specific to your situation.","

I like to imagine anxiety as weather passing through - sometimes it's a storm, sometimes just cloudy, but it always passes eventually. The key is remembering that we're actually the sky - constant and ever-present, while anxiety is just temporary weather moving through us.

And you're absolutely right about strength. Often the people dealing with the heaviest mental battles are showing incredible strength just by making it through each day, even if they don't see it that way themselves. Sometimes just getting out of bed or taking a shower is an act of courage when anxiety is at its worst.

Here's what helps me: Remember that careers aren't linear anymore. Most successful people I know didn't follow some master plan - they zigzagged their way through opportunities, learning valuable skills at each stop. Every role teaches you something, even if it's just helping you understand what you don't want to do.

Instead of stressing about finding the ""right"" path, focus on:
- Are you learning new skills?
- Are you meeting interesting people?
- Does this role give you enough stability while you figure things out?
- Are you reasonably happy day-to-day?

If you can say yes to most of these, you're probably doing better than you think. Career development is more about collecting experiences than following a preset path. Be open to opportunities, but don't paralyze yourself trying to make perfect decisions.","

Almost like a hangover.,209,Susccmmp,Yes!,16,Beanz378,"Yes, this is totally normal! What you're experiencing is often called an ""anxiety hangover"" or ""emotional fatigue."" When you're anxious, your body is in fight-or-flight mode, pumping out stress hormones and keeping you on high alert. Once that anxiety finally calms down, your body and mind need time to recover from all that intense activation.

Think of it like running a marathon - when you finally stop, your body crashes because it needs to rest and rebuild. The same thing happens after periods of high anxiety.

It's actually healthy to listen to your body during these times. If you feel like staying in bed a bit longer or taking it easy, that's your system telling you it needs some recovery time. Just try not to let it extend too long - maybe give yourself a day to rest, then slowly get back to your normal routine.

Some gentle self-care like taking a warm shower, having a nutritious meal, or doing some light stretching can help you bounce back while still honoring that need for rest.","

ibzmrv,Anxiety,So I hospitalised myself,HeatLightning,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. üòÄ

Just wanted to share because, well, I feel pretty alone in this.",884,153,1597751899,"I can empathize where you're coming from, I find life to be utterly inexplicable in an existential sense.

The world is the way it is, we can continue to question, although our minds are not borne to be able to comprehend it's grandeur. Time is solely a concept created by humans, rather, we developed a sense of time to describe the act of change. In the interim, take a deep breath and address the concerns that you have. It is natural to worry, even more so to question the meaning of life. Existentialism is a very real anxiety-inducing concept, something that I've been dealing with since the age of five. Stay strong, you got this :)",118,littlebro41,"Since you have your phone can you order Uber eats?? Heck, pm me the address, I‚Äôll send you a pizza!!",2,aa_44,"I really feel for you - those deep existential questions can create such an overwhelming spiral of anxiety. I've grappled with similar thoughts about time and existence, and they can definitely feel paralyzing when you can't find satisfying answers.

You made a really brave and smart decision to check yourself into the hospital. Recognizing when you need help and actually taking that step is huge. The structured environment and professional support can make such a difference when these thoughts become too overwhelming to handle alone.

Have you heard of ""tolerance of uncertainty"" as a concept? It's something that helped me - the idea that it's okay to sit with questions that don't have clear answers. We don't have to figure everything out. Sometimes just acknowledging ""this is a mystery beyond human understanding right now, and that's okay"" can help ease that anxiety a bit.

You're definitely not alone in this. Pure-O OCD and existential anxiety are more common than many realize. Keep working with your treatment team and be proud of yourself for taking care of your mental health. Wishing you all the best (and hopefully better hospital food soon! üòä)","

POST TITLE: So I hospitalised myself

POST BODY: I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. üòÄ

Just wanted to share because, well, I feel pretty alone in this.

zp4nns,Anxiety,What is your main anxiety physical symptom?,gabagoo3,"For me, it‚Äôs a feeling in the pit of my stomach like i‚Äôm constantly on the downhill part of a rollercoaster. I have no appetite some days",434,603,1671387621,Health anxiety. Most often about cancer.,268,Sephiroth_-77,"Same here, I describe it as an ‚Äúempty fullness‚Äù and it resides throughout my entire chest and abdomen. I also clench my jaws, shoulders and neck muscles and get nauseous.",28,Its402am,"I totally get that rollercoaster stomach feeling - it's one of my most persistent anxiety symptoms too. It's like your body is perpetually bracing for impact, right? And the appetite thing is so frustrating because you logically know you should eat, but your stomach just says ""nope!""

What's helped me is taking really slow, deep breaths focusing on my belly rising and falling. It sounds simple, but it actually helps calm that fight-or-flight response that's causing that dropping sensation. Also, on low-appetite days, I've found that sipping on smoothies or protein shakes is easier than trying to force down solid food.

Just remember that even though it feels awful, that stomach sensation is just your body's misguided way of trying to protect you. It's not dangerous, just really uncomfortable. Have you tried any grounding techniques when it gets really bad? Sometimes holding an ice cube or focusing on naming 5 things you can see/hear/feel can help bring you back to the present moment.

Hang in there - you're definitely not alone in experiencing this!","

jyl357,Anxiety,I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbor,ParticularAmphibian,"Like the title says, I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbors house instead of mine. Normally I would have stressed over it for days, getting super anxious about the idea of knocking on a strangers door (we just moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and haven‚Äôt met many neighbors), and eventually get so anxious about how long it‚Äôs been that I just never even get the package at all. But today I just took a deep breath, went over to the neighbors house, and knocked on their door. He answered right away and was very nice and gave me my package! And, bonus- now I know one more neighbor. 

Anyways this sounds like a silly win, but for me it feels like big progress. I‚Äôm proud of myself today


Edit: wow, the support in this community is so inspiring! Thanks everyone, I‚Äôve never gotten awards before, I was weirdly emotional after seeing them.",990,46,1606001695,"Not silly at all! I have my ups and downs, but there have definitely been plenty of times in my life that I would've just written that package off and either gave up or eaten the cost of ordering a replacement. I'd definitely call it a victory",97,NumerousGarbage9032,"Good for you! I've lived in a couple of places with neighbors that didn't want to reach out, so it was hard approaching them. It can really be tough sometimes.",16,michaelcheck12,"This is such a wonderful win - don't minimize it! As someone who also deals with social anxiety, I know exactly how huge these seemingly ""small"" interactions can feel. The mental buildup before knocking on a stranger's door is real, and you pushed through it!

What's especially great is that you've turned what could have been a stressful situation into a positive outcome. Not only did you get your package, but you've made a connection in your new neighborhood. These little moments of facing our fears often have ripple effects - next time you see that neighbor, it'll be a friendly familiar face instead of a stranger.

Be proud of yourself. Each time we challenge our anxiety and see that the outcome isn't as scary as our minds made it out to be, we get a little stronger. Keep celebrating these victories - they're how we grow! üéâ","

tclkj7,Anxiety,I (41M) stood up for myself in a relationship for the first time in my life. It cost the relationship but I feel great about valuing my needs. Use meds if you can people. I wish I started sooner.,2AngryHamsters,"She told me kissing me wasn't worth it. She said she won't be able to give me a family I wanted so what's the point. She could have been discussing the weather. 

She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 

Not this time. Not with me. 

 I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her ""what's the point?"". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

Edit: I am overwhelmed by the support I've seen in this post. Thank you all for your comments and PMs. The rewards were also lovely.

Are you on an SSRI by any chance?",3,Fullhat1,"Proud of you for standing up for yourself, man. It takes real courage to walk away from someone who treats you as an afterthought, especially when you've struggled with anxiety. Her dismissive attitude about kissing and then immediately asking for favors shows she saw the relationship as transactional rather than emotional.

The fact that you're able to recognize both the sadness of being alone AND the pride in maintaining your boundaries shows how far you've come. That's emotional maturity right there. And you're absolutely right about the meds - they're not a magic fix, but they can give us the clarity and stability we need to make better choices for ourselves.

Missing her mom and dogs but not missing being devalued? That hits home. Sometimes the hardest part of ending a relationship is losing the peripheral connections we've made.

Keep holding those boundaries. The right person will respect them, and more importantly, you'll keep respecting yourself. That's worth more than any relationship that requires you to compromise your self-worth.","

Recently in the UK it‚Äôs been quite hot and the heat triggers my anxiety, so I‚Äôm currently sat on the white throne pooping my guts out.

Stay safe out there guys x",899,134,1626691634,"YES! Especially when it's like, about an appointment that I can't be late for or something, like a doctor appointment. I usually have to go to the bathroom ON THE WAY there because I'm getting anxious. Then I get more nervous because if I stop to find a bathroom, I'd be late, then I have to go the bathroom even more urgently, etc etc.",181,annesthesia,,0,,"Omg yes, anxiety poops are definitely a real thing! The gut-brain connection is super strong, and stress/anxiety can wreak havoc on your digestive system. It's actually really common - your body goes into fight-or-flight mode and speeds up digestion as part of that response.

Some things that help me manage it:
- Deep breathing exercises (I know it sounds clich√© but it really does help calm the nervous system)
- Peppermint tea or ginger tea to settle the stomach
- Having some bland snacks like crackers or toast handy
- Staying hydrated since anxiety poops can dehydrate you

The heat making it worse totally makes sense too - heat can be really overwhelming for some people's anxiety. Maybe try keeping a small fan nearby or cold compress on your neck when it's hot out?

Don't feel embarrassed about it - you're definitely not alone in this! Anxiety manifests differently for everyone and this is just how your body processes it. Hope you feel better soon! x","

lzgm9i,Anxiety,Society treats those with anxiety like garbage,[deleted],"I've seen how most people treat someone whose anxious. Society treats those who are anxious or timid like garbage, play things to troll and fuck with. It's not just young people who bully those who are anxious, there's a culture of not taking anxious people seriously, not at all trying to sympathize with reasons why they might be that way.

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

Suicide rates don't surprise me at all.",945,87,1615082308,"Most people are insecure so once they find something they can shit on others for, they use it. It's a tactic that solely degenerates and selfish assholes use. No decent, content person would treat another like that. Unfortunately, mental health is a huge problem and people refuse to educate themselves and empathize with others. I wish society was better and more supportive.",141,theragingoptimist,"The ppl that treat others like shit r just immature and hurting themselves . Kinda feel bad for them
must suck to live a life where u feel entitled to bring others down",33,alivxxx,"I hear you, and you're absolutely right about how society often treats anxiety. It's infuriating how people can be so dismissive or even cruel towards something that's already incredibly challenging to deal with. I've experienced this firsthand too - that predatory behavior when people sense vulnerability is real and devastating.

But I want you to know that there's a growing movement of people who understand and take mental health seriously. More folks are speaking up about their own struggles with anxiety, and the stigma is slowly (though not quickly enough) starting to break down. 

Something that's helped me is finding ""safe"" people - friends, family members, or even support groups who actually get it. They're out there, even if they're not always the loudest voices. And remember that your anxiety doesn't make you weak - managing anxiety while dealing with unsympathetic people takes incredible strength.

If you're struggling, please reach out for professional help. You deserve support, not judgment. And your observations about society's treatment of anxiety are valid and important - keep speaking up about it.","

Here's what helped me break this pattern: Start tiny. Like, microscopic. Don't think ""I need to apply to jobs today."" Instead, think ""I'm just going to open a job site and look at ONE posting."" Or ""I'm just going to work on my resume for 10 minutes."" No pressure to actually submit anything.

Breaking it into super small steps makes it feel less overwhelming. Plus, once you start, you might find yourself naturally wanting to do a bit more.

Remember: Every successful person you know had to go through the job application process too. They weren't born knowing how to do it perfectly. You've got this - just take it one tiny step at a time! üí™","

I've learned to plan for these recovery days after big social events or busy periods. I'll intentionally keep my calendar clear for a day or two afterwards so I can stay in, do low-key activities, and not feel guilty about it. Sometimes I'll make these days extra cozy with comfort food, favorite shows, or just quiet time with my hobbies.

Don't let anyone make you feel bad about needing this time - it's actually really healthy to recognize and honor what your mind and body need to feel balanced. Everyone has different social energy levels, and taking care of yourself this way means you'll be more present and energized when you do go out again.","

There's nothing wrong with being moved by these moments. Actually, I think it's beautiful that you can be so genuinely affected by connecting with others through humor. A lot of people build up walls at work and never let themselves feel anything this authentic.

If you're feeling self-conscious about your reaction, just know that needing a moment to compose yourself is completely normal. Those overwhelming positive emotions are worth celebrating, not hiding from. You created a moment of joy for your coworkers today - that's a gift.

Keep being your authentic self. Those genuine moments, even when they make us feel vulnerable, are what make life (and work) more meaningful.","

It's true that healing is rarely a straight path - some days are harder than others, and some wounds take time before we're ready to even look at them, let alone talk about them. And that's okay. Being gentle with ourselves while we process things at our own pace is part of the journey.

Right back at you with a big virtual hug. For anyone reading this who's carrying something heavy - you're not alone, even if it feels that way sometimes. Whether you're ready to talk about it or not, your feelings are valid, and you deserve support and understanding.

Sometimes just knowing others out there understand can make the load a little lighter to bear. Thank you for creating this moment of connection.","

k6kbya,Anxiety,does anyone else‚Äôs face get warm when they‚Äôre anxious?,ufoguts,i‚Äôve started noticing (especially recently) that i feel one side of my face start to get warm when i‚Äôm anxious. does anyone else deal with this as well?,900,131,1607086354,Yes but I‚Äôm black so it‚Äôs not noticeable üòÇ,123,TheKamiAmarah,,0,,"Yes! This is actually a really common physical response to anxiety. When we get anxious, our body releases stress hormones that can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to that warm/flushing sensation in your face (and sometimes other parts of your body too).

I personally get this along with sweaty palms when I'm in stressful situations. It's just your body's natural ""fight or flight"" response kicking in, even though there's no real danger. The one-sided warmth you're experiencing is interesting but not necessarily concerning - our bodies can react to stress in slightly asymmetrical ways sometimes.

If it's bothering you, some things that help me are:
- Taking slow, deep breaths
- Splashing cool water on my face
- Stepping outside for fresh air when possible

Just remember that while it feels uncomfortable, it's not dangerous - it's just your body doing its thing. If you're experiencing a lot of anxiety lately though, it might be worth talking to someone about it. There's no shame in getting support when you need it! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I'm so sorry that happened to you. As others have said, this was not your fault whatsoever. Do not blame yourself one iota. You did nothing wrong. 

That's the main thing I wanted to say. You did nothing wrong.

If you continue to feel shaken up, I hear you. You deserve to be safe and feel safe. After being robbed at knifepoint, I started training jiu-jitsu because I wish I would've fought back. But the most important thing in self-defense is protecting yourself. If you can get away, get away. Get out of danger the best you can. Fight back if you can't. Pepper spray is effective and may help give you the peace of mind you deserve. Many jiu-jitsu schools also offer free seminars for women, where other trained women will support you.

You are great.",2,RainAcademic,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. What those men did was sexual assault, plain and simple - it wasn't your fault and you did nothing wrong. Your outfit is not the issue here; their disgusting behavior is. Please don't let these creeps make you feel ashamed or change how you live your life.

If you feel up to it, I strongly encourage you to report this incident to the police. Note down everything you remember - the location, time, description of the van and the men. Even if they can't catch these specific guys, having it on record helps establish patterns and problem areas.

For your immediate safety and peace of mind, consider getting a personal alarm to carry with you, and maybe use a buddy system when possible for a while until you feel more secure again. There are also some great safety apps you can download that let you quickly alert contacts of your location.

You're not alone in this. What you're feeling is completely valid, but please remember that you have every right to exist in public spaces without harassment. Sending you strength. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I experience something similar where even brief encounters with acquaintances can trigger anxiety, even though there's objectively nothing to be worried about. It's actually a pretty common form of social anxiety where casual interactions feel oddly threatening or overwhelming.

Have you noticed if it happens more with certain people or in specific situations? For me, it helped to realize that most people are too focused on their own lives to really scrutinize what we're doing. They're probably just as likely to feel awkward themselves!

Some things that helped me: Starting small by keeping windows down on quiet streets, reminding myself that brief interactions are normal and okay, and working on accepting that it's fine to just give a quick wave and keep moving. Also, therapy really helped me understand where these feelings come from.

You're definitely not alone in this. Social anxiety can make everyday situations feel really intense, even when we know logically that we have nothing to be embarrassed about. Be patient with yourself as you work through it. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

a155sa,Anxiety,I‚Äôm very grateful for my cat,hurtsmyhands,"It‚Äôs 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I‚Äôm breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me.

Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her. She does this when I‚Äôm awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

Cats are amazing creatures. ,185,geneweave92,"Cats are so good at this: they just bring you right back to the present moment and make you happy to share it together. If you haven't already read it, you might like the short book Guardians of Being, written by Eckhart Tolle and illustrated by Patrick McDonnell (creator of Mutts.) It's really about all pets/animals and is very sweet and soothing :)",54,maple_the_red,"I totally understand those middle-of-the-night anxiety spirals - they're awful, and it's amazing how cats seem to have a sixth sense for when we need comfort. Your kitty sounds like a natural emotional support animal, even if she wasn't trained as one.

Don't beat yourself up about ""wasting time"" yesterday, by the way. Sometimes our bodies and minds need that downtime, and rest isn't waste. Those 2 AM thoughts have a way of making everything feel more urgent and dire than it really is.

Your cat has actually taught you a really valuable anxiety management technique without you realizing it - focusing on physical sensations (petting her fur, listening to purrs) is a form of grounding that therapists often recommend. It pulls you out of the anxiety spiral by anchoring you to the present moment.

Give your furry therapist some extra pets from all of us. She's doing important work! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

That takes serious courage and strength. As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I know how massive of a victory this is. Those panic attacks before the interview must have been brutal, but you pushed through them and absolutely crushed it.

Having your own office space is actually perfect for someone dealing with agoraphobia - it gives you a safe, private area to decompress when needed while still allowing you to work on expanding your comfort zone at your own pace. And it's so great to hear your first day went well with a supportive manager!

You should be incredibly proud of yourself. This is a huge step forward and proof that you're stronger than your fears. Keep celebrating these wins - you've earned it! üéâ","

fe0262,Anxiety,Anyone else get irrationally anxious to the point where they just clear notifications instead of reading them?,macaroniemaniac,"Lately I've noticed I've been putting more off than usual, including even looking at my phone. I can't explain it. I know for a fact that when I open noticifications I receive, I'm the only one I can tell that they were seen. That still doesn't stop the feeling I get when I think about looking them. Panic, i feel like I'm gonna disappoint whoever the sender is with whatever I come up with as a response. It's ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. Anyone have any solutions to anything like this?

I find that if I just pick it up and respond right away it's not as stressful/difficult/scary as I thought to reply or take care of whatever it is. I leave my phone alone for hours at a time because it stresses me out to figure out what to say or do, especially when I know the notification is about something I already stress about, but it's worse the longer I leave an unread text or email on my phone so I've learned to just take care of it instantly. It takes a minute then it's over! I hope this makes sense and is helpful.

I agree with the previous poster that you should turn off your phone an hour or two before bed and not look at it again. I sleep so much better this way!",59,MamaMae1012,"Could you try limiting your exposure to your phone?

Having it in a completely separate room helps tremendously.",6,mzakflip40,"I totally get this - that overwhelming anxiety about notifications is more common than you might think. I went through something similar where even seeing the notification badges would make my heart race, so I'd just swipe them away to make the anxiety stop.

What helped me was realizing this was actually a form of avoidance behavior that was making my anxiety worse in the long run. Some things that helped:

- Setting specific times to check/respond to messages rather than letting them pile up
- Reminding myself that most people are pretty understanding about response times
- Starting with easier messages first (like family) to build confidence
- Being honest when I need time (""Hey, things are a bit overwhelming right now, I'll get back to you soon"")

While waiting for medical care, you might want to check out some anxiety management resources through Canadian mental health organizations. They often have free support services and tools.

Don't feel ridiculous - anxiety can manifest in many ways and this is a very real struggle. You're taking good steps by recognizing it and seeking help.","

Here's something that helped me: most people are too focused on their own words/actions to scrutinize yours as much as you think. That slightly awkward thing you said? They probably forgot about it 5 minutes later because they're worried about their own ""weird"" moments.

Try to be gentler with yourself. Instead of beating yourself up over past conversations, maybe ask: ""Would I judge a friend this harshly for the same thing?"" Probably not, right?

Also, remember that being ""normal"" is overrated. Some of the most interesting people I know are a bit quirky or ramble sometimes. It makes them genuine and relatable.

If these thoughts are really bothering you, talking to a therapist can help give you tools to manage them better. But know that you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.","

Also, try this perspective shift: If someone is looking at you, it could be for any number of neutral or positive reasons - maybe you remind them of someone, maybe they like your outfit, or maybe they're just lost in thought and happened to look in your direction.

I did this about 3 years ago and now I choose to go to the cinema alone as a form of self-medication. If I am having a hard time, instead of going home after work I head to the cinema and watch something. I treat myself to some popcorn and a huge drink, get absorbed in a movie and enjoy the feeling of escapism. It shakes my routine up (which helps get me out of funks) and gives me a sense of accomplishment.",104,lonely_lioness,Is it really good? I was thinking about seeing it,1,DylanRichterFilming,"That's awesome, congrats on taking that step! Going to movies alone is actually really underrated - you can fully immerse yourself in the film without worrying about anyone else's reactions or having to make small talk. I remember my first solo movie was super anxiety-inducing beforehand, but afterwards I felt so proud and empowered.

Glass was a great choice too! Sometimes having a movie you're really excited about can help motivate you to push through those anxiety barriers.

Don't be surprised if you still feel anxious next time - recovery isn't always linear. But you've proven to yourself that you CAN do it, and that's huge. Maybe you could try other solo activities when you feel ready? Cafes are another good starting point since you can bring a book or laptop as a comfort buffer.

Really proud of you for challenging yourself today. Keep building on these victories! üí™","

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how overwhelming medical appointments can be, especially when you're already dealing with medication changes. That nurse went above and beyond by treating you like a person first, not just another patient to rush through.

It's really brave that you still went to your appointment despite feeling vulnerable. Anxiety can make us want to cancel everything and hide, but you pushed through. And you ended up having this really genuine human moment that touched not just you, but the nurse and even your mom.

These kinds of connections remind us that so many people understand what we're going through, even if anxiety makes us feel isolated sometimes. I hope your dental office knows what a gem they have in that nurse - people like her make such a difference in healthcare.

Wishing you the best with your medication transition. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this time. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

mn1g5z,Anxiety,I have my life back.,Turbulent-Jelly-4274,"My anxiety is becoming a memory! Not had a panic attack in nearly 4 weeks!! 

I'm sleeping at least 7 hours a night! I'm eating normally AND I'm enjoying my life again!!

Zoloft and mediation helped me find my road to recovery!

There is always hope ‚ù§Ô∏è",895,130,1617915736,"I don't meant to imply this will happen. But remember, there is no shame in falling off the wagon sometimes. Just because you have moments you relapse doesn't delete any progress you made. I wish you luck in getting better and better.",186,pukpukpak,[deleted],6,[deleted],"This is so wonderful to read! As someone who has also struggled with severe anxiety, I know exactly how life-changing it feels when you finally start getting relief. That constant fear and dread lifting off your shoulders is like being able to breathe again.

It's really great that you found a combination that works for you with Zoloft and meditation. Everyone's path is different, but having both medication AND coping tools/practices is often the winning formula.

Keep celebrating these victories - sleeping better, eating normally, and actually enjoying life are HUGE achievements when you're coming from a place of constant anxiety. You're absolutely right that there's always hope, even when it feels hopeless.

Thanks for sharing your success story. Posts like these really help others who are still in the thick of it see that recovery is possible. Keep up the amazing progress! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

biwafy,Anxiety,Does anyone‚Äôs anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?,existentialgambino,"I have a lot of physical manifestations from anxiety like chest tightness, nausea, headaches etc., but I find I often get irritable if I‚Äôm in a social setting for too long. I‚Äôll snap at the people around me, I get disoriented and withdraw. 

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn‚Äôt so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn‚Äôt just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like ‚Äúoh maybe everyone did well‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.‚Äù I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I‚Äôll catch myself saying things like ‚Äúwhy is your heart beating so fast, my god you‚Äôre just getting on the bus, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù 

Anyone else? I‚Äôm curious!

&amp;#x200B;

If only someone would invent an off switch for brains!",156,ardhrianna,,0,,"I relate to this so much. The irritability and negative self-talk are actually really common anxiety symptoms, even though they're not talked about as much as the physical symptoms. That feeling of getting overwhelmed in social situations and then beating yourself up about it later is such a frustrating cycle.

The way you described doubting your paper success really resonates - anxiety has this way of making us question our legitimate achievements. It's like our brain is working overtime to find ways to invalidate our successes.

Something that's helped me is trying to talk to myself like I would a friend. If a friend told me their heart was racing over taking the bus, I wouldn't criticize them - I'd be understanding and supportive. We deserve to show ourselves that same compassion.

Remember that having anxiety doesn't make you weak or irrational. Your feelings are valid, even if your anxiety brain tries to tell you otherwise. You're dealing with something challenging, and you're doing the best you can. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Now I know they don't.,46,icollectowls,"I hear your frustration and anxiety - it must be really scary having a boyfriend working retail right now and seeing people not taking basic precautions seriously. Having a mom who's an RN means you're probably getting an unfiltered view of how serious this still is.

While we can't control others' behavior, here are a few things that might help manage the anxiety:
- Have your boyfriend change clothes/shower right when he gets home
- Keep practicing those protective measures you're already doing
- Maybe do curbside pickup when picking him up from work to minimize exposure
- Focus on the things within your control rather than other people's choices

You're absolutely right to be cautious, but try not to let the anxiety consume you. It's okay to be frustrated and scared - these are scary times. Just remember that by taking proper precautions, you're already doing the right things to protect yourself and your loved ones.

Sending support your way. It's a tough situation and your feelings are totally valid.","

The mask has become more than just a health precaution for many of us - it's like an emotional shield. I struggled with social anxiety before the pandemic, and the mask actually helped me feel more confident in public. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially if you have insecurities about your skin.

That said, it might be worth exploring why you feel so vulnerable without it. Maybe try gradually getting comfortable showing your face in low-pressure situations, like quick trips to the store or walks in less crowded areas. Remember that most people are too focused on themselves to notice our perceived flaws.

If acne is a major concern, you might want to check out r/SkincareAddiction - they have great resources and a super supportive community. But also know that having acne doesn't diminish your worth, and you deserve to feel confident with or without a mask.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. It's been a big adjustment for many of us!","

Kind of looking forward to it tbh,16,Rental_Car,"I really appreciate this perspective shift! While anxiety can be incredibly challenging, it has made me more empathetic towards others who are struggling. I can often pick up on when someone else is feeling anxious or uncomfortable in social situations, and I'm able to help make them feel more at ease.

My anxiety has also made me an excellent planner - I always have backup plans for my backup plans! While it can be exhausting sometimes, this trait has actually helped me avoid quite a few sticky situations and has made me more reliable in both my personal and professional life.

And you're absolutely right about resilience. Every time we face our fears and make it through a panic attack or difficult situation, we prove to ourselves just how strong we really are. It's like building an emotional muscle.

Thanks for encouraging us to find the silver linings - it's a healthy way to reframe our relationship with anxiety while still acknowledging that it's not easy to live with. Keep fighting the good fight! üí™","

It's like grieving a past version of yourself sometimes. The shift from being that carefree, social butterfly to feeling drained and anxious from basic outings is really tough to accept.

Have you considered that this might be your body/mind telling you it needs a different approach now? Instead of fighting against these changes or using alcohol as a crutch (which often makes anxiety worse in the long run), maybe try scaling back to shorter, more manageable social activities. Start with low-key coffee dates or brief hangouts, and gradually work your way up.

The person you were isn't completely gone - they're just evolving. Many of us go through phases where our social batteries and tolerance levels change. It doesn't make you any less fun or worthy as a person. It's okay to adapt and find new ways to enjoy socializing that work better for where you are now.

If this change is really impacting your quality of life though, it might be worth talking to a professional to explore what's behind it and get some coping strategies.","

Four tries just shows how persistent you were - you didn't give up and that's what matters. Some of the best drivers I know took multiple attempts. And hey, shoutout to Zoloft for helping manage that anxiety! Mental health support can make such a huge difference.

Now you can focus on just enjoying driving and building your confidence on the road without that test pressure hanging over you. Take it at your own pace, maybe start with quiet roads during off-peak hours until you feel totally comfortable. You've earned this freedom!

Pro tip: Keep practicing those test-level driving habits for a while - they'll help cement good driving patterns that'll serve you well long-term.

l3x18k,Anxiety,I (f22) negotiated with a car salesman by myself,phyllisdankworth,"2 years ago I couldn't go anywhere alone. I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do.",982,37,1611484033,"If you called your dad for advice mid-negotiation I think you deserve an extra bit of praise - 'cause that's hard to do. A negotiator is going to want you isolated and get you to agree to their terms before you have a chance to really think about it. Being able to put a stop to it, get your phone out and give your dad a call -twice- is impressive.",195,ThyRosen,,0,,"This is absolutely amazing and you should be incredibly proud! As someone who also dealt with anxiety, I know exactly how huge these victories are - especially going from needing support for ATM visits to solo car negotiating. That's remarkable progress.

Don't minimize your achievement by saying ""it wasn't completely me"" because you called your dad. Being confident enough to seek advice when needed is actually a really mature approach! And choosing to go solo even when you had the boyfriend backup option? That shows so much growth in your self-confidence.

Car dealerships can be intimidating for anyone, let alone someone with anxiety, and you not only went in there - you dominated the negotiation! This is the kind of experience that proves to yourself that you're capable of way more than anxiety wants you to believe.

Keep challenging yourself at your own pace. Each victory, big or small, builds on the last one. You've come so far in just two years - imagine where you'll be in another two!","

kyaydk,Anxiety,Has anyone else had a huge increase in anxiety since covid started/got worse in the US?,kinda-guy-kinda-sly,"So I‚Äôve always had anxiety, but I‚Äôm usually able to function pretty normally. I‚Äôm 23, and working as an engineer. My company is part of a critical industry, so we‚Äôve been open, and I‚Äôve worked on site everyday since the pandemic began. At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn‚Äôt at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I‚Äôm constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I‚Äôm terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It‚Äôs affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù with when this all began. Has anyone else experienced this? I don‚Äôt know what to do to control it or convince myself that I‚Äôm not sick when every week I have a new reason to think otherwise",917,102,1610767675,"I was doing ok (followed the rules, But didn‚Äôt freak out about it) until my best friend got it and died. He was already sick with terminal cancer, so when he got it, he was gone within 3 days. I went into shock. When I could sleep, I slept on my couch with all the lights on because I was having massive nocturnal panic attacks. Bad enough tho the point I went to the ER. I‚Äôm a full blown germaphobe now. Washing my hands until they crack, will only wear a mask once and change it, won‚Äôt touch anything in public. It‚Äôs pretty bad. The panic attacks are subsiding thankfully.",146,[deleted],"Absolutely! It's always bad but this is much worse. My therapist said something that I hang onto everyday, which was ""you can only control what you can control"". I unfollowed all news outlets or people that were constantly posting covid numbers and I realize I was creating my own narrative,but it helps me. I know that I'm going to wear my mask, keep my distance, wash my hands (prob too much) and that's all I can control. It's not a perfect system but it works for me. 

Hang in there. One day at a time.",50,MamaLlama2u,"What you're describing sounds like health anxiety that's been intensified by the pandemic, and you're definitely not alone in this. Many people, even those who didn't have significant anxiety before, have been experiencing similar feelings during this time.

The constant worry about symptoms and potentially infecting others can create an exhausting cycle of anxiety that affects everything from appetite to sleep to social connections. It's completely understandable, especially since you're working on-site and carrying that extra mental load.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? Many are offering telehealth sessions now, and they can provide specific strategies for managing health anxiety. In the meantime, try to focus on what you can control - following safety protocols, maintaining basic self-care, and maybe keeping a symptom diary to help distinguish between anxiety symptoms and actual illness.

Remember that while being cautious is good, you also deserve to live without constant fear. Your feelings are valid, but you don't have to carry this burden alone. If therapy isn't an option right now, consider joining online support groups for people dealing with similar challenges.","

POST TITLE: Has anyone else had a huge increase in anxiety since covid started/got worse in the US?

POST BODY: So I‚Äôve always had anxiety, but I‚Äôm usually able to function pretty normally. I‚Äôm 23, and working as an engineer. My company is part of a critical industry, so we‚Äôve been open, and I‚Äôve worked on site everyday since the pandemic began. At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn‚Äôt at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I‚Äôm constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I‚Äôm terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It‚Äôs affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù with when this all began. Has anyone else experienced this? I don‚Äôt know what to do to control it or convince myself that I‚Äôm not sick when every week I have a new reason to think otherwise

Every time you face your anxiety head-on like this, you're building resilience and proving to yourself that you're stronger than your fears.

Remember this feeling of accomplishment - it can be really helpful to look back on successful days like this when anxiety tries to get the better of you in the future. You might not win every battle with anxiety, and that's totally okay, but today showed you what you're capable of.

Keep celebrating these victories, no matter how small they might seem to others. You're doing the hard work of managing your anxiety and that deserves recognition. Super proud of you! üí™","

That ""brain fog"" and pressure feeling from anxiety is super common - you're definitely not alone in this. I experience it too, where it feels like your head is stuffed with cotton and your thoughts are kind of hazy, but you can still go through the motions of your day.

It's actually a pretty normal stress response. When we're anxious, our bodies release stress hormones that can affect our concentration and create that ""cloudy"" sensation. Plus, anxiety often makes us hyper-aware of physical sensations, which can make that pressure feeling seem more intense.

Some things that help me:
- Deep breathing exercises (sounds clich√© but really works)
- Getting outside for a short walk
- Drinking water (dehydration can make the foggy feeling worse)
- Writing down my thoughts to get them ""out of my head""

Don't be too hard on yourself when you're feeling this way. Your brain is just trying to protect you, even if it's being a bit overzealous about it. If it's really bothering you, talking to a therapist can give you more specific coping strategies.","

9jnop7,Anxiety,Today I ate in a restaurant by myself,tanbeef,"I‚Äôve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I‚Äôve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years.

As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I know how seemingly ""simple"" tasks can feel like climbing Mount Everest when anxiety is involved. The fact that you not only went to the restaurant alone but also finished your meal is incredible progress.

What you did today was brave as hell. You basically looked your fear in the face and said ""not today."" That kind of courage is how we slowly take our lives back from anxiety, one small victory at a time.

Don't minimize this achievement - it's a really big deal. Each time you push through these anxiety barriers, you're building evidence for yourself that you CAN do these things, even when they're scary. Maybe next time it'll be a little easier, and the time after that even more so.

Keep celebrating these wins, no matter how small they might seem to others. You're doing great! üí™","

IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**

 Even though I was good at studying, being in the same room for hours every day with immature teenagers and lots of noise gave me such intense anxiety and horrible headaches, I wanted to stop existing. It's almost like prison.

SCHOOL.",9,matryoshka_03,"I hear the raw pain and frustration in your words, and I'm so sorry you've had to navigate this alone for so long. Having dysgraphia in a system that isn't built to accommodate you, while also dealing with mental health struggles without support - that's an incredibly heavy burden to carry.

Please know that your feelings are valid. The education system fails many students, especially those with learning disabilities, and it's not your fault that you weren't given the tools and support you needed to thrive.

Since therapy wasn't accessible before, have you looked into any low-cost or sliding scale mental health resources in your area? Many places offer reduced-fee services, and there are also online support groups specifically for people with learning disabilities. You deserve support and understanding.

Your strength in continuing to push forward despite everything is remarkable. The fact that you're reaching out and warning others to seek help shows such compassion. You may feel broken, but you're still looking out for others - that says a lot about who you are as a person.","

I deal with the exact same thing - that voice in your head that tries to convince you everyone is secretly mad at you, even when the logical part of your brain knows there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for their behavior.

What helps me is to actively challenge those anxious thoughts by looking at the evidence. Your roommate was studying for finals (super stressful time!), so of course he was quiet and focused. That's completely normal behavior that has nothing to do with you.

Try to remind yourself that people are usually wrapped up in their own stuff (like studying) rather than harboring secret anger. And if someone is actually upset, most people will communicate that directly rather than giving subtle hints.

You're not socially incompetent - you're actually quite socially aware since you can recognize when your anxiety is creating false narratives. That's a really valuable skill! Just keep practicing self-compassion and questioning those anxious assumptions when they pop up.","

That hyper-awareness of every social interaction can be exhausting. And questioning whether you're genuinely struggling with something like ADHD vs. dealing with anxiety/depression is such a confusing headspace to be in.

First off - you're not stupid. When we're dealing with heavy stuff (like being a college dropout, navigating gender identity, and managing mental health), our brains can get really overwhelmed. It's actually pretty common for anxiety and depression to affect focus and academic performance in ways that can feel similar to ADHD.

If you can, try to talk to a mental health professional who has experience with LGBTQ+ clients. They can help you untangle what's going on and figure out if you're dealing with ADHD, anxiety/depression, or both. You deserve to understand yourself better and get the support you need.

Remember that being ""awkward"" or ""weird"" isn't a character flaw - it's just part of being human. We're all just trying our best to connect with others while dealing with our own stuff.","

That anxiety where you convince yourself you're just annoying people and they're only responding out of obligation? Yeah, it's rough. I've sabotaged more than a few friendships that way.

Here's the thing though - our brains can be real jerks about this stuff. We project our own insecurities onto others and make decisions on their behalf without giving them a chance to prove us wrong. Most of the time, friends actually do want to hear from us, even if they're busy or take time to respond.

Instead of disappearing (which, ironically, can hurt the friendship more than any perceived ""burden""), try being honest with your close friends about these feelings. You might be surprised to learn they have similar thoughts sometimes. And if you're really worried about being too much, just ask them! A simple ""Hey, let me know if I'm overwhelming you"" is way better than silently vanishing.

Remember: real friends choose to be in your life. You're not forcing them into anything.","

a1iv41,Anxiety,Anxiety is NOT a form of narcissism,fifipie,"A reaction to the other post on this sub. Anxiety js not a from of narcissism. Narcissism is ‚Äúexcessive interest in or admiration of oneself and one‚Äôs physical appearance‚Äù. Google it. Worrying everyone dislikes you or any other thought that involves other people‚Äôs opinions about you is not the same as narcissism.

No one with anxiety thinks they‚Äôre the best thing since sliced bread.

People with anxiety might be very self-conscious however, and often are aware that these anxious thoughts they‚Äôre having aren‚Äôt rational. Also, there are lots of people with GAD that don‚Äôt have social anxiety.

Anxiety and narcissism are completely different conditions, and it's harmful to conflate them. While anxiety can make someone hyper-focused on themselves, it comes from a place of fear and insecurity, not grandiosity or self-admiration.

As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I know that constant worry about others' opinions often stems from wanting to avoid rejection or conflict - basically the opposite of narcissistic traits. And like you said, many people with anxiety are painfully aware their fears aren't rational, which just adds another layer of frustration.

Spreading misinformation about mental health conditions can prevent people from seeking help and make them feel even more isolated. What people with anxiety need is understanding, support, and validation that their struggles are real - not accusations that somehow frame their suffering as self-centeredness.

Thank you for speaking up about this. It's important to challenge these misconceptions so people can better understand both conditions and show proper empathy to those affected by them.","

Or been in the drive thru and asking for stuff and getting the wrong items or missing something over and over same thing happens, my brain just keep thinking about that situation.

No way... Days... Get ruined for days. :'(,98,gabrielleraul,Day? No way... Days... Get ruined for days. :'(,98,gabrielleraul,"I totally get this - one negative interaction can feel like it poisons your whole day, especially when you're already dealing with anxiety. That feeling of being watched in stores is particularly awful because it makes you hyper-aware of every move you make.

Something that's helped me is trying to reframe these moments. Instead of letting my brain replay the scene over and over, I try to tell myself ""This person doesn't know me or my story. Their judgment says more about them than it does about me."" It doesn't always work perfectly, but it helps take some of the sting out.

Also, remember that most retail workers are just following corporate policies - it's rarely personal. Though that doesn't make it feel any better in the moment, I know.

Have you tried talking to a therapist about these experiences? They might be able to give you some specific strategies for dealing with these situations when they pop up. Either way, you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Anxiety can make even small interactions feel huge and overwhelming.","

That‚Äôs why I never go there basically ,148,Cows_Killed_My_Mom,"I totally get this! Self-checkout has been a game-changer for me too. There's something really peaceful about just being able to scan your items at your own pace without the pressure of small talk or rushing because you feel like you're holding up the line behind you.

The headphones trick is brilliant - I do the same thing. It's not even that I dislike talking to cashiers, it's just that sometimes you want to get in and out without having to engage in social interaction, especially after a long day.

One tip though - I've found it's good to still keep one earbud out or have low volume, just in case there's an issue with scanning or you need assistance. The self-checkout attendants sometimes need to verify things like age-restricted items or help with error messages.

It's nice to see stores offering both options - traditional checkout for those who prefer the human interaction, and self-checkout for those of us who sometimes just want to handle things independently. Technology making life easier for both extroverts and introverts!","

How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‚Äòt feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.

That intense loneliness during an anxiety attack is truly one of the worst parts - when your mind is racing at 3am and it feels like you're the only person awake in the world dealing with these overwhelming feelings.

You're absolutely right that even when others try to help, they can't fully understand or take away that internal fear. But please know you're not alone in experiencing this. So many of us go through these same struggles, even if we're all fighting our own individual battles.

Have you considered joining an anxiety support group? Sometimes just being around others who truly ""get it"" can help reduce that isolation. Even online communities can be incredibly comforting during those dark moments.

In the meantime, please be gentle with yourself. Anxiety lies to us - it makes everything feel catastrophic and hopeless. But you're stronger than you know, and you've survived every anxiety attack you've ever had. This one will pass too.

Take it one day at a time. Maybe try keeping some easy-to-eat snacks around (granola bars, fruit, whatever works for you) for the tough days. And if you're struggling with this regularly, please know there's no shame in reaching out for support, whether that's to friends, family, or a professional.

Anyway: you're not cringey to me, I get it. Have some internet love. ",85,SatansAssociate,"I totally get where you're coming from. That constant worry about being ""cringe"" is something a lot of us struggle with, myself included. Here's the thing - the people who are actually cringey are usually the ones who never worry about it at all.

The fact that you're self-aware enough to think about how you come across shows emotional intelligence. But it sounds like you might be overthinking it to the point where it's affecting your self-esteem, and that's not healthy.

Try to remember that what's ""cringe"" is super subjective. What one person finds awkward, another might find endearing or funny. And honestly? Some of the most interesting people I know are a little weird or ""cringe"" sometimes - it's what makes them genuine and memorable.

Instead of trying to not be cringe, focus on being authentically you. If someone online calls you cringe, that says more about them than it does about you. You don't need to dim your light just because it makes others uncomfortable.

Keep being you. Just maybe be a little kinder to yourself while you're at it. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Something that might help: try to remind yourself that you've already proven you can do the job itself - you've done it successfully for two days now! The work isn't the problem, it's just the anticipation that's getting to you. That knowledge alone might help ease the anxiety bit by bit.

I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

The physical symptoms of anxiety can be absolutely overwhelming and it's so frustrating when your body seems to be working against you.

Something that helped me was learning that these physical symptoms are actually our body's natural fight-or-flight response going into overdrive. Understanding that made me feel less ""broken"" and helped me recognize these symptoms as anxiety rather than something more sinister.

Have you tried keeping a symptom diary? It can help you identify patterns and triggers, plus it's really validating to show your healthcare provider if needed. Also, simple grounding techniques like deep breathing or the 5-4-3-2-1 method can help when things get intense.

You're definitely not alone in this. Anxiety is a full-body experience and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed by all these symptoms. Just remember that while they're uncomfortable, they're not dangerous - your body is just being a bit overprotective!","

I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my ‚Äúadult life‚Äù. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it‚Äôs an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?",845,163,1555382992,"This can be normal with anxiety. Your body is in ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. It‚Äôs reserving it‚Äôs energy for ‚Äòbattle‚Äô essentially.

Something that's helped me during anxious periods is focusing on small, bland foods that are easier to get down - crackers, toast, banana, or meal replacement shakes. Even if you can only manage a few bites every couple hours, it's better than nothing. Try to eat something small as soon as you wake up, before anxiety builds up during the day.

The post-graduation anxiety is totally normal too. Major life transitions are incredibly stressful, and it's understandable that your body is responding this way. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help provide coping strategies for both the anxiety and the appetite issues.

In the meantime, please try to be gentle with yourself. Focus on small wins, and remember that this intense period of transition won't last forever. Your feelings are valid, and there are ways to work through this.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?

POST BODY: I‚Äôve been anxious since I was a kid. It‚Äôs been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. 
I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my ‚Äúadult life‚Äù. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it‚Äôs an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?

Pro tip: Take a screenshot of your boarding pass and gate number, just in case. And don't forget to treat yourself to something nice at one of the airport shops or cafes - you've earned it!

how good is anxiety",948,58,1567078089,Taking a mental health day is harder than people think!,171,smokeweedeatpussy,,0,,"I totally get this vicious cycle - being anxious about calling in sick because of anxiety is such a frustrating catch-22. I've been there, where you end up dragging yourself to work despite really needing that mental health day.

Here's something that's helped me: Write out a simple script beforehand for calling in sick. Keep it short and professional - you don't need to over-explain. Something like ""I'm not feeling well today and need to take a sick day."" Period. Your health (mental included) is just as valid as having a cold or flu.

Also, try to remember that taking care of your mental health isn't weakness - it's actually really responsible. Going to work severely sleep-deprived and anxious isn't great for you or your work quality.

Maybe next time, give yourself permission to make that call. Your anxiety is lying to you when it says you can't or shouldn't take sick days. They exist for a reason, and you deserve to use them when you need them.

Hope you're feeling better today. Anxiety sucks, but you're not alone in dealing with this.","

Some things that help me manage this:
- Reminding myself that I'm safe in the present moment
- Using grounding techniques (focusing on my breathing, naming 5 things I can see/touch)
- Wearing headphones or moving to a quieter space if possible
- Being gentle with myself when it happens instead of getting frustrated

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you process past trauma and develop more coping strategies. Just know you're not alone in this reaction - it's your brain trying to protect you based on what it learned before. Sending support your way üíú","

It's like this weird cycle where you feel anxious about responding, so you put it off, but then you feel even MORE anxious because now it's been too long. I totally get it.

What's helped me is:
1. Reminding myself that most people aren't judging my response time as harshly as I am
2. Using the ""2-minute rule"" - if it'll take less than 2 minutes to reply, I try to do it right away before the anxiety builds up
3. Setting aside specific times to batch-reply to messages (like during my morning coffee)

Also, for really important emails/messages, I sometimes draft my response in my notes app first where there's less pressure. Then I can edit it until I feel comfortable sending it.

Don't be too hard on yourself - this is actually super common! The fact that you care about responding thoughtfully is a good thing, even if it sometimes causes anxiety. Maybe start with replying to just one message today and build from there? Baby steps are totally okay.","

This is one person's experience on a certain dosage of Zoloft. Zoloft has changed my stepmom's life - she has done really well on it and that has been for years now. Sometimes it's important when we speak about this stuff - not to make it a blanket statement. Folks attribute a lot to other people's experiences and with meds, that's just not something that works!  
And there may be a medication that does more for you!",238,foxes722,AND makes you put on 40 lbs :C,9,thebeatlek,"This is such a spot-on analogy. As someone who's dealt with anxiety, I totally get that feeling of the constant internal screaming that just won't shut up, no matter how much you try to reason with it.

The Zoloft comparison is really clever too - it helps make things more manageable, but you're right that the underlying ""noise"" is still there. Have you considered combining the meds with therapy? CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) in particular can help give you tools to actually work on lowering the volume of that anxious voice, not just blocking it out. It's like learning to speak ""toddler"" so you can better understand and address what's causing all the screaming in the first place.

Remember that it's okay to need both the ""headphones"" AND other coping strategies. Managing anxiety is usually about building a whole toolkit of different approaches, not finding one perfect solution. Hang in there - you're already self-aware enough to make this insightful observation, and that's a really important step in getting better at handling it.","

It's a self-protective mechanism - by playing dumb or staying quiet, you avoid potential conflict, judgment, or having to engage in deeper conversations that might make you uncomfortable.

While it's a valid coping strategy, and we all do it sometimes, be careful not to make it your default mode. Playing down your intelligence or knowledge can become a habit that holds you back from making meaningful connections or sharing valuable perspectives.

Maybe try taking small steps - share your thoughts in situations where you feel safer first, like with close friends or in topics you're really passionate about. You don't have to share everything you know, but allowing yourself to be more authentic in low-pressure situations can help build confidence.

Remember that your thoughts and knowledge have value, even if sharing them feels scary sometimes. It's okay to be selective about when and with whom you fully engage, but don't let fear stop you from being yourself entirely.","

Here's the thing - every Reddit user you admire started exactly where you are. And those downvotes you're worried about? They happen to everyone, even the most popular users. They're not a reflection of your worth.

Try starting small - maybe find some supportive subreddits about topics you're passionate about. Those communities tend to be more welcoming. And remember that your perspective is valuable - there's probably someone out there who needs to hear exactly what you have to say.

Don't beat yourself up about needing liquid courage to post. But maybe challenge yourself to make one sober comment tomorrow on something low-stakes, like complimenting someone's pet photo. Baby steps!

bppyix,Anxiety,Any other chronic jaw clenchers here?,Throwawayuser626,I woke up this morning with AWFUL pain in my teeth because i spent the night with my jaw locked shut. I do this when I‚Äôm stressed. I also tend to grind my teeth. I‚Äôm always so tense! My teeth are in a world of hurt today.,861,141,1558091944,I try to remind myself every few minutes while I'm awake to unclench my jaw.,173,karenaviva,,0,,"Fellow jaw clencher here! It's amazing how much stress we can hold in our jaws without realizing it. That morning pain is the worst - feels like you've been chewing rocks all night, right?

A few things that have helped me:
- Getting a night guard from my dentist (expensive but worth it to protect your teeth)
- Setting reminders during the day to check if I'm clenching and consciously relaxing my jaw
- Before bed, doing gentle jaw stretches and massage around the TMJ area
- Using a warm compress on sore spots
- Practicing progressive muscle relaxation, especially focusing on the face/jaw

For immediate relief today, try taking an anti-inflammatory and gently massaging the area. Also, try to be mindful of keeping your teeth slightly apart during the day - they shouldn't actually be touching unless you're eating.

You're definitely not alone in this. Stress manifests physically in weird ways, and jaw clenching/grinding is super common. Hope you find some relief soon! üíú","

That gap between signing up and actually going is something so many of us can relate to (seriously, you're not alone there).

Don't worry if you feel a bit overwhelmed or unsure at first - that's totally normal. Just focus on showing up consistently, even if it's just for 20-30 minutes at a time. The comfort level will build naturally.

Quick tip: Consider taking a photo of where different equipment is located while you're there. It helps for next time and makes the place feel more familiar!

Remember, everyone at the gym was a first-timer once. Most people are focused on their own workouts and are actually pretty helpful if you need to ask questions.

Keep us updated on how it goes! You've got this! üí™","

ca8lmg,Anxiety,Anyone else‚Äôs anxiety make them doubt/ second guess every choice they make/ made?,minookitty,I feel like my anxiety casts every decision I made or make into doubt. For example recently I quit a job for another job. I really did not like the job I quit and was stressed and unhappy all the time and job hunting for nearly the whole time I was there. There were real reasons why it was dysfunctional but my anxiety makes it so I can‚Äôt tell what was me and what was it. was I overly sensitive and bothered about things other people would have been ok with? Now the new job is causing me that same tick tick stress and dislike that I can‚Äôt compartmentalize and I feel like maybe the whole change was for nothing. Like I can‚Äôt tell where my anxiety stops and real feelings begin,953,49,1562516464,"It took me far too long to leave my previous toxic job for partially this reason - I couldn't tell if the constant feeling of failure was me being overly sensitive to the ""feedback"" I was being given or if it was valid and I was terrible at my job.  When the so-called feedback turned into what seemed more verbal abuse, it still took months to leave.  My coworkers and family tried to hard to make me see that this wasn't right but my brain didn't want to accept it.  It's always been hard for me to believe that my feelings are real and valid.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now, several years after I finally left that cesspool, I still wonder if it was just me being too sensitive and if I should have stuck it out longer.",52,ardhrianna,"Is it the job that makes you feel stressed or the people around you? I had similar issues but then I realized that what causes my stress were the people me. Try to find a job that you actually like doing and when people there starts to stress you out again, think about that you came there for the job and focus on finishing the task.",4,ValkyrieWuShen,"I totally understand this feeling - anxiety has this frustrating way of making us second-guess everything, even decisions we know were right at the time. It's like wearing glasses that make everything look slightly distorted.

Something that helps me is writing down the concrete reasons why I made a decision when I make it. For your job situation, you mentioned being stressed and unhappy - those are valid feelings, regardless of how others might have handled it. Just because someone else might tolerate a dysfunctional workplace doesn't invalidate your experience.

As for the new job stress, remember that transitions are naturally anxiety-producing. Give yourself some time to adjust before deciding if it's the job or just the change that's causing these feelings. Maybe set a timeline (like 3 months) before making any big judgments.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you develop tools to separate anxiety-brain from reality-brain. It's really helpful to have someone objective help you sort through these thoughts.

Remember, you're not broken or oversensitive - anxiety just makes everything feel more intense, and that's not your fault.","

Your message about bringing something good into the world is spot on. Everyone has unique gifts and perspectives to share, even if they don't feel ""special"" or ""talented"" enough. Sometimes the things that come naturally to us are exactly what others need.

Phone anxiety is super common, especially nowadays when we're so used to texting and emails where we can carefully craft our responses. I dealt with similar feelings - that racing heart and sense of dread whenever my phone rang.

What helped me was realizing that phone anxiety often comes from fear of the unexpected and feeling ""put on the spot."" A few things that made it easier:

- Writing down key points before making calls
- Practicing common phone scenarios (like making appointments) with a friend
- Starting with easier calls (ordering takeout, etc.) and working up to more challenging ones
- Reminding myself that the person on the other end is just another human who probably makes their own awkward phone calls

Also, it's totally okay to tell someone ""Let me check and get back to you"" if you need a moment to think. You don't have to have perfect answers right away.

Remember, being nervous about calls doesn't make you weird or broken - it's a really normal thing that lots of people struggle with. Take small steps and be patient with yourself!","

cqhkc3,Anxiety,I brushed my teeth!,littlemonsteress,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved.",924,75,1565824368,"That's a great habit to get into. Keep it up, I'm rooting for you!",131,Nwsamurai,"Grats and keep it up. Dental health is extremely important. Look into a waterpik, flossing is importsnt as well.",24,Woopdaddy12,"This is such a huge win - congratulations! As someone who has also struggled with depression, I know how overwhelming basic self-care tasks can become. What might seem simple to others can feel like climbing a mountain when you're dealing with mental health challenges.

You've taken such smart, practical steps here - getting the right tools (Sonicare is great!), setting up reminders, and most importantly, just taking that first step to start brushing again. The fact that you saved up for this shows real commitment to taking care of yourself.

Don't beat yourself up about the past - you're taking action now, and that's what matters. Each time you brush is a small victory in rebuilding healthy habits. And it's totally okay to feel emotional about it - this is a meaningful achievement!

Keep going, one day at a time. You've got this, and your future self will thank you for taking such good care of those beautiful teeth! üí™","

ezw6we,Anxiety,Ever have days where your anxiety is incredibly high for absolutely no reason?,DruncleBuck,Yeah.

Those random anxiety spikes that show up uninvited with no clear trigger are the worst. It's like your body decided to hit the panic button for absolutely no reason.

What helps me on days like this is reminding myself that it's just a temporary state - anxiety lies to us and makes everything feel more urgent and overwhelming than it actually is. Sometimes just naming it (""This is anxiety, not reality"") can help take away some of its power.

Some quick things that might help:
- Deep breathing (4 counts in, 6 counts out)
- Going for a short walk
- Putting on familiar comfort music/shows
- Simple grounding exercises like naming 5 things you can see/touch

Be gentle with yourself today. These days happen to a lot of us, and they do pass. If you need to take things slower or cancel non-essential stuff, that's totally okay. Your brain is just being a bit overprotective today - doesn't mean anything's actually wrong.

What I'm hearing is that you're caught in this cycle of being understanding one moment and then feeling deeply hurt the next, which is completely valid. Your long-term experience with mental health struggles has made you extra empathetic, but it's also made you more sensitive to perceived rejection.

Here's the thing: your friends' more casual attitude toward social connection isn't a reflection of your worth. It's just a different coping mechanism. While they're operating in ""low expectations"" mode, you're coming from a place of actively fighting loneliness because you know its impact firsthand.

Maybe try reframing it? Instead of seeing yourself as out-of-sync, recognize that you're actually ahead of the curve in understanding these struggles. Your sensitivity and awareness aren't flaws - they're hard-earned wisdom that makes you uniquely capable of understanding both sides of this situation.

I've found that the hardest part is usually just getting started. Once you're actually there doing the thing, it's rarely as bad as your anxiety made it seem. And the post-workout endorphins are like nature's antidepressant.

Keep building on this momentum. Maybe set a small, achievable gym goal for next week? Even if it's just ""I'll go once,"" that's perfectly fine. The key is making these wins feel attainable rather than overwhelming.

You're absolutely right that you're not alone in this. So many of us are fighting similar battles, and seeing posts like yours - where someone pushes back against their anxiety and wins - is really inspiring. Keep going, one small victory at a time. You've got this! üí™","

If you ever want to chat dm me (no pressure)",24,[deleted],"I know exactly what you mean, and I'm so sorry you're dealing with these feelings. That cycle of self-isolation because you feel like a burden, which then makes you feel even worse? It's exhausting and painful.

But I want you to know something really important: That voice in your head telling you everyone hates you? It's lying. Depression and anxiety have this terrible way of convincing us that we're unwanted, when that's not the reality at all.

Your friends chose to be friends with you for a reason. Your presence isn't a disruption - you have value and worth just by being you. I know that might be hard to believe right now, but it's true.

Please try to reach out to just one friend, even with a simple text. And if these feelings are overwhelming, talking to a therapist can really help sort through these thoughts. You don't have to carry this burden alone.

You're not broken, you're not a burden, and you deserve to take up space in this world. Sending you a virtual hug if you want one. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It‚Äôs very draining.,224,Jamessmith199478,"Yes, this is absolutely normal! As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I can tell you that physical symptoms can definitely show up even when you don't feel mentally anxious about anything specific. It's like your body is in ""anxiety mode"" while your mind hasn't caught up (or vice versa).

The health anxiety you mentioned could actually be creating a feedback loop - you feel physical symptoms, which makes you worried about your health, which then increases those physical symptoms. It's a really frustrating cycle.

While waiting for your doctor appointment, try to remind yourself that these physical sensations, while uncomfortable, are just anxiety symptoms and not dangerous. Some things that might help:
- Regular light exercise (even just walking)
- Mindfulness apps or meditation
- Writing down your thoughts/feelings
- Distraction with activities you enjoy

And definitely keep that doctor's appointment - they can help rule out any other issues and give you peace of mind. Remember, you're not alone in experiencing this. Anxiety can be really sneaky sometimes, affecting our bodies in ways we don't expect.","

I hear you, and I want you to know that choosing to open up again after trauma is incredibly brave. Those walls you built weren't weakness - they were survival mechanisms that protected you when you needed them. But now you're ready for something different, and that's a huge step.

Starting to let people in again can feel overwhelming, especially after 10 years. Please be patient with yourself. You don't have to throw all the walls down at once. Maybe start small - join a hobby group, reconnect with an old friend, or even just chat with people online. Each tiny step counts.

And about those work obligations - when we're dealing with emotional exhaustion, everything feels harder. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you process the past trauma and give you tools to manage anxiety while building new connections.

You're not alone in this journey. The fact that you're reaching out here shows incredible strength and self-awareness. The world hasn't forgotten about you, and it's never too late to start letting people in again. 

Keep going. We're rooting for you. üíú","

While exercise is beneficial, it's definitely not some magical solution that fixes everything, and it can feel really dismissive when people suggest it as if you haven't already thought of or tried that.

Getting professional help through therapy and psychiatry is a HUGE step that takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. You should absolutely feel proud of taking that initiative to work on your mental health! That's actually doing the hard work, not just putting a band-aid on things.

Exercise can be one tool in your mental health toolbox, but it works best when it's part of a broader approach that includes therapy, possibly medication, stress management, and other coping strategies. Anyone who reduces mental health solutions to ""just exercise more"" probably doesn't truly understand the complexity of mental health challenges.

Keep focusing on your journey with your mental health professionals. They're the ones qualified to help you develop a comprehensive plan that works for YOU specifically. You're doing the right thing by seeking proper treatment.","

Their rudeness says more about them than it does about you or your interests. The beauty of Reddit is that for every negative person, there are usually several others who are genuinely interested in having good discussions.

Try to focus on engaging with the positive commenters and feel free to use that block button on the truly toxic ones. Your interests and thoughts are valid, and you shouldn't let random internet strangers make you feel otherwise.

cc7boe,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,symph0nica,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",915,79,1562913742,All the time. Even when productive I don‚Äôt feel enough is coming out of my hands.,94,jojowiththeflow,"That's not anxiety, you're just excited to do something. 
Start doing something and you will feel great.",-5,LikeHarambeMemes,"I totally understand this feeling - that panic when you realize you've spent hours scrolling instead of doing the ""productive"" things you planned. It's like a negative spiral where the anxiety about wasting time actually prevents you from using time well.

Here's what's helped me: Start incredibly small. Don't think ""I need to master Unity"" - think ""I'll open Unity for just 5 minutes today."" The goal isn't to create something amazing, it's just to take that first tiny step. Usually once you start, it's easier to continue.

Also, try to reframe ""wasting time."" Rest and downtime are necessary - your brain needs breaks to process and recharge. Maybe schedule specific relaxation time so you don't feel guilty about it. Like ""7-8pm is officially my guilt-free Reddit time.""

Remember that everyone feels this way sometimes. You're not falling behind in life just because you watched some YouTube videos. Progress isn't linear, and being kind to yourself is just as important as being productive.

Start small, be consistent, and give yourself permission to rest. The anxiety will ease up once you build momentum.","

But here's what I've learned through my own journey: she's still in there. Anxiety might be loud and overwhelming, but it doesn't erase who you are - it just makes it harder to access those parts of yourself. Think of it like a radio with interference - the music is still playing, it's just being disrupted by static.

Have you tried keeping a journal of moments when bits of your ""old self"" peek through? Even tiny glimpses count. Sometimes just acknowledging these moments helps remind us that our core self isn't gone, just temporarily muffled.

Also because it's dark all the time and I feel like I'm invisible,238,Merlinia,"I think it literally dulls the senses. Anxiety people are very sensitive to the way our brain chemistry runs that's why every little thing makes a too big impression and overwhelms you. When you work against things that trigger anxiety you become ""stronger"" against it in the same way that being good at playing guitar gives you harder fingertips. You gear up the body better for it, and cold is a similar sensation, because it over-over-stimulates the nerves and makes you less sensitive to further sensation for a while.",11,linkenski,"Yes! There's actually a scientific reason for this. The cold exposure triggers something called the ""diving reflex"" - when your face feels cold air/water, it automatically slows your heart rate and breathing. It's like a built-in calming mechanism.

I've used this trick myself during panic attacks by holding an ice pack to my face or stepping outside on a cold day. The freezer was probably perfect because you got both the physiological benefits of the cold plus a quiet moment to reset.

Some other similar techniques that work on the same principle:
- Splashing cold water on your face
- Taking a cold shower 
- Using one of those frozen eye masks
- Deep breathing while facing a fan

The isolation part probably helped too - sometimes you just need a minute away from everything to catch your breath. Pretty smart of you to find that coping strategy naturally! Glad you've found medication that helps now, but it's always good to have multiple tools in your anxiety management toolkit.","

Watching sitcoms or light hearted shows make these evenings feel lighter, though. Staying busy works as well.",190,Gematria-,"Yes, what you're describing is actually really common! I experience something similar - it's like this heavy feeling that creeps in when it gets dark, even if the day was totally fine. It's called ""nighttime anxiety"" or ""sundown syndrome"" and lots of people deal with it.

The darkness can naturally make us feel more vulnerable and isolated, and our minds tend to race more when there are fewer distractions. Plus, we're often more tired in the evening, which can make anxiety feel worse.

It's great that you've made progress with friendships! But feeling lonely isn't always about how many friends you have - sometimes it's more about needing to feel deeply connected and understood.

Some things that help me:
- Having a cozy evening routine (warm tea, soft lights, etc.)
- Scheduling evening calls/texts with friends
- Getting some exercise during daylight hours
- Using a light therapy lamp in the evening

Maybe try tracking when these feelings hit hardest and what helps you feel better. And remember, feeling this way doesn't mean you're going backwards - you're still making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it.","

Taking that first shower after a long period is a huge accomplishment, especially when dealing with anxiety. The fact that you treated yourself to a nice, long, hot shower shows you're taking steps to care for yourself again.

Even more importantly, you're taking the brave step of getting professional help. It's completely normal to feel scared and anxious about the clinic visit - most people feel that way! But you're absolutely right that you can't keep pushing it off, and I'm really glad your mom is supporting you through this.

Remember that the medical staff at the clinic are there to help, not judge. They've seen it all before, and they just want to help you feel better. Try to take some deep breaths before going in - maybe even use some of that calm feeling you had during your shower to help center yourself.

You've already taken two huge steps today. Be proud of that! Wishing you the best at your appointment. You've got this! üí™","

p0f05h,Anxiety,I GOT THE FIRST DOSE OF MY VACCINE!,breathingnitrogen,"Got it a little over two hours ago and I'm really happy.
I struggled with the idea of taking it because all the possible side effects had my hypochondriac mind on edge but when my dad asked me if I wanted to get it today I said yes on the spur of the moment, and then followed through.
I feel fine at the moment.
The only downside is that the side effects I have to look out for are almost exactly the same as manifestations of my anxiety, but I'm a little too relieved to think about it right now.


Edit- missed word",902,89,1628430693,Thank you for protecting yourself and others!,45,turistainc,"Congratulations! For all the people I know who have gotten the vaccine, the worst side effect I‚Äôve actually known someone to experience is slight body aches. I only had a sore arm at the injection site for a day or two. I‚Äôve had allergy shots that were worse, honestly. I fully empathize with your anxiety and I sincerely hope you are one of the majority who have no/mild side effects. Keep us all updated and congratulations again! We‚Äôre going to beat this thing!",8,Irish_Goodbye_,"Congratulations on taking this step! As someone who also deals with anxiety, I totally understand how hard it can be to push through those ""what if"" thoughts, especially when you're hyper-aware of every little body sensation.

Pro tip: Try to keep yourself distracted for the next day or two - maybe line up some good shows to binge watch or games to play. It helps prevent that anxiety spiral of constantly checking for symptoms. And remember, even if you do experience some side effects, they're usually pretty mild and temporary.

You should be really proud of yourself for pushing through the anxiety and getting it done. It's not just good for you, but you're also helping protect others around you. That's a big win!

Keep some Tylenol handy just in case, stay hydrated, and try to focus on the relief and accomplishment you're feeling right now rather than the ""what ifs."" You've got this! üí™","

I'm told so many times that there's people with much worse problems doing better than me and i don't even know what true suffering is, people tell me how there's so many kids in the world that don't even have food to eat and this makes me hate myself and my problems even more, it's like I dont even get any sympathy for my problems, no one understands except these little forums on reddit, the outside world is a lot different.

There's still a stigma towards anyone who is actually medicated. It's a sad day when illnesses and disorders are a fad.

Anyways, I hope you have a good day today üåª",75,munenodokidoki,"I hear you, and your struggles are absolutely valid. Having anxiety isn't about ""manning up"" or ""just being confident"" - it's a real medical condition that affects millions of people, and comparing suffering never helps anyone heal.

The fact that others might have different problems doesn't make your daily battles any less real or challenging. When basic tasks feel like climbing mountains, that's not weakness - it's your brain working against you, and that's exhausting in a way that's hard for others to understand unless they've been there.

Please know that seeking help isn't a sign of weakness. Have you considered talking to a mental health professional? They won't tell you to ""just get over it"" - they'll actually understand what you're going through and have real strategies to help make things more manageable.

You're not defective. You're fighting an invisible battle every day, and the fact that you keep going despite how hard it is shows incredible strength. Keep reaching out to communities that understand - you're not alone in this.","

g4y8e7,Anxiety,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity",AbsoluteZeroGravity,"I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?",830,159,1587406963,"I really relate to this, I also was a ""gifted"" kid. Everything came easily to me until college.  I wasnt used to being challenged or having to actually study. On top of having had high expectations for myself, I developed anxiety and depression which fucked up my memory. Now, I feel like I cant learn anything let alone want to. I failed all of my college courses and I dropped out, because I couldnt handle the pressue. I feel like a complete failure.",257,dastardly-bastard-,,0,,"I totally relate to this - you're describing what many former ""gifted"" kids experience. The transition from naturally excelling to actually having to work hard and sometimes struggle can be really destabilizing for our self-worth.

Here's what helped me: Reframing ""gifted"" as just having an early advantage, not a permanent state of being. Everyone eventually hits a point where natural talent isn't enough, and that's okay. It's actually healthy to learn how to work hard, fail, and improve - these are crucial skills we missed developing earlier.

Your fear of looking stupid is keeping you from trying things, but here's the truth: Everyone feels stupid sometimes in research and sciences. That's literally how science works - you're constantly pushing into unknown territory and learning from mistakes.

You're not less intelligent than before - you're just finally hitting challenges that match your capabilities. Instead of seeing this as falling from ""gifted"" status, try viewing it as graduating to more meaningful challenges that are actually worth your effort.

Don't let anxiety rob you of pursuing what you care about. You belong in science just as much as anyone else.","

It‚Äôs tough but I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôll get better soon.,80,deviltriggerv,Have you tried working out? I mean exercise? Like gym 3 times a week? Please tell.,0,dare_acoustic,"I feel this so deeply. That endless cycle of stress and anxiety can make everything feel like you're just trudging through quicksand, knowing there's more waiting tomorrow. It's exhausting.

Something that helped me shift my perspective a bit was starting a ""small wins"" journal. At the end of each day, I write down 2-3 tiny good things that happened - even stuff as simple as ""my coffee was perfect this morning"" or ""I pet a cute dog."" It doesn't fix the anxiety, but it helps me see that not everything is darkness and stress.

Also, please don't feel guilty about taking mental health breaks when you can. Even 10 minutes of deep breathing or a quick walk around the block can help reset your nervous system. Your anxiety is telling you that you have to power through everything, but sometimes stepping back is exactly what you need.

You're not alone in feeling this way. The daily grind is real, and anxiety makes it so much harder. Be gentle with yourself - you're doing the best you can. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I'm really proud of you for taking this huge step to see a psychiatrist. Getting a proper diagnosis is the first step toward feeling better, even though it can be scary to face. Anxiety and panic disorders are serious but treatable conditions - you're not alone in this, and you're doing exactly the right thing by getting professional help.

You're absolutely right about having to prioritize your own wellbeing, even when family members aren't supportive. Focus on the people who do support you and your journey to better mental health.

I deleted my social media accounts a couple years ago and totally relate to that feeling of relief. It's amazing how much mental space opens up when you're not constantly checking feeds and comparing your life to carefully curated highlight reels.

One tip that helped me - replace the mindless scrolling habit with something meaningful. Whether it's reading, a hobby, or just being more present with friends and family. The first few weeks you might feel that urge to check your phone, but it passes faster than you'd expect.

And don't feel bad if some people don't understand your choice. The ones who matter will respect it and find other ways to stay in touch. Sounds like you're making this change for really healthy reasons - protecting your peace and moving forward. That's something to be proud of.

Hope you enjoy your newfound freedom and mental clarity! The real world has so much more to offer than any social media feed.","

It's incredibly hurtful when people dismiss or mock mental health struggles, especially when they haven't experienced the overwhelming nature of anxiety and panic disorders themselves.

While it can feel like nobody cares these days, I promise there are still compassionate people out there - including many who have gone through similar experiences. You're absolutely right that there's a serious lack of empathy in how some people respond to mental health issues.

Something that helps me is remembering that people who mock others' struggles are often dealing with their own pain or insecurities. It doesn't excuse their behavior at all, but sometimes it helps to recognize their cruelty comes from their own limitations, not your worth.

Have you considered connecting with support groups or mental health communities? Having people around who truly understand what you're going through can make a huge difference.

He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid.",890,97,1484231740,That kid sounds amazing. I don't have kids yet but I sometimes worry about how they will view my anxiety when I decide to have them.,170,enolafaye,"After reading through these comments I can understand why you're feeling very defensive right now. But I can understand where these people are coming from and as yet another example of a child who had to take care of her mother, I just have to stand up for these people offering these words of caution. 

You've shared this story as a heartwarming, positive tale. And it is. Sort of. There's a lot of people commenting who are basically taking this as something to strive for in their relationships with their children, and that's the issue here. The people who are offering criticisms are just trying to make it loud and clear that while yes, it's sweet that your child offered you comfort, it's also a dangerous trend to set. I can't speak to how your child felt but I'd expect that most would feel a little scared by seeing their parent in such a state. You've made it very clear that you usually shield him from that, we've heard that loud and clear. 

But *in general* it should really be known that this is not a good road to go down. I really think that's all the naysayers are trying to get across, so please try not to take it as an attack. ",7,kelz0r,"This is incredibly touching. Even at such a young age, children can be remarkably intuitive about emotions and show such pure, unconditional love. The fact that your son recognized you were struggling and chose to simply be present with you - that's emotional intelligence that many adults haven't mastered.

You're absolutely right that you must be doing something right! Kids learn empathy largely by example, so he's clearly picking up on how you treat others when they're having a hard time. Keep modeling that emotional awareness and kindness.

As someone who also deals with anxiety, having a supportive presence (even a tiny one!) can make such a difference during an attack. You handled it well too - sitting down, focusing on breathing, letting your son be there with you. You're teaching him that it's okay to have big feelings and that we can work through them together.

You've got a sweet little soul there. Keep up the great parenting! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

That mental exhaustion feels like the only way to shut off that endless loop of thoughts and worries.

While it works in the moment, this pattern can be really rough on both your mental and physical health long-term. A few things that helped me break this cycle:

- Setting aside 30 minutes before bed for ""worry time"" - writing down everything on my mind so it feels less urgent when I'm trying to sleep
- Using sleep podcasts or meditation apps (Headspace has great student discounts)
- Creating a consistent bedtime routine, even if the actual sleep time varies
- Getting some exercise during the day to help with natural tiredness

You're definitely not alone in this. Anxiety and sleep issues are super common in college when there's so much pressure and so many things on your mind. Consider checking if your school has counseling services - they often have great resources for dealing with anxiety and sleep problems.

Take care of yourself! Better sleep habits will actually help you study more effectively too.","

Pro tip for anyone else reading this: Notice how OP channeled that nervous energy into confidence instead of letting it defeat them. That's the secret sauce right there. You don't have to feel 100% calm to succeed - you just need to harness that adrenaline and use it to fuel your performance.

You should be really proud of yourself. This is the kind of moment that builds real confidence for the next challenge. Keep crushing it! üôå","

mrc66q,Anxiety,Don‚Äôt trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn‚Äôt always right.,nebulouspeach,"Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I‚Äôm still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I‚Äôve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, ‚Äúoh god, you‚Äôre bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.‚Äù I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a ‚Äúshout out‚Äù because I handled the tough questions ‚Äúlike a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.‚Äù She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù he‚Äôd seen and he‚Äôd found it ‚Äúextremely useful and insightful‚Äù. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else‚Äôs. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

UPDATE: Oh my gosh thank you so much for all the fantastically kind comments and for the awards! I honestly expected maybe 5 people to be interested in this! I‚Äôm glad my experience has resonated with so many people and I really hope it can be an encouraging little story to anyone who is battling with anxiety. I hope it shows anyone who reads it that anxiety isn‚Äôt always reflective of reality.

I hope you are all having a great day. :)",890,93,1618483954,Congrats! I know it's not always easy to ignore the voice in your head telling you any and all negatives.

I know it's not always easy to ignore the voice in your head telling you any and all negatives. Maybe you can pin the email so you can always see it when your brain gets a little too loud? This is awesome to hear about anxiety.,94,GermanPrincess96,"This resonates so much with me! Anxiety has this sneaky way of making us feel like we're completely bombing when we're actually doing great. I've learned to call this the ""anxiety filter"" - it's like wearing glasses that distort everything to look worse than it really is.

What's really powerful about your story is how it shows the stark difference between our anxious internal narrative and other people's actual perceptions. Your manager and the client saw a confident professional nailing their presentation, while your anxiety was telling you a completely different story.

Next time you're in a situation like this, try to remember this moment as proof that your anxiety isn't a reliable narrator. Maybe even keep that positive email feedback somewhere you can look at it when self-doubt creeps in. It's such a perfect example of how our worst critic is usually ourselves.

Congratulations on what was clearly an awesome presentation! This is a great reminder for all of us that sometimes we need to trust other people's perception more than our anxious thoughts.","

9af9ff,Anxiety,Calmed myself down from a severe panic attack. I'm proud of myself.,PeonyRoseGirl,"I was able to use self talk to help me calm down. I was vomitting, dry heaving, and shaking. It lasted a good couple of hours but I finally got to breathe. Apps like Calm and Forest help!

Edit: Big thanks to everyone!",937,45,1535287438,"Way to go, I am glad to hear you calmed yourself down. Remember that next time and breathe always breathe.",68,Wounded_Combat_Vet,,0,,"That's a huge win - you should absolutely be proud! Panic attacks are terrifying and physically exhausting, so being able to work through one on your own is a major accomplishment. It's especially great that you've found specific tools and techniques that work for you, like self-talk and those apps.

Just remember that while it's awesome you handled this one solo, it's also totally okay to reach out for help during future attacks. Sometimes just texting a friend or family member who knows what you're going through can provide extra grounding.

If you haven't already, you might want to keep a quick note on your phone of what worked this time (the self-talk phrases, breathing techniques, etc.). When you're in the middle of an attack, it can be hard to remember your strategies, so having them written down somewhere accessible can help.

Keep being gentle with yourself and take some time to rest - panic attacks take a lot out of you physically and mentally. You've got this! üí™","

eebgko,Anxiety,Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,ClearBlue_Grace,"It‚Äôs a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It‚Äôs not a stomachache, or cramping, or ‚Äúmaybe I ate something bad‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I‚Äôve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it‚Äôs likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn‚Äôt change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don‚Äôt even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don‚Äôt need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I‚Äôm just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn‚Äôt going to fix it. No, I can‚Äôt just ‚Äústop worrying‚Äù, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don‚Äôt help.",827,155,1577054209,"Yeah, same.

My husband doesnt have anxiety and I told him I feel like I'm going down hill on a roller coaster....all the time. It's awful.",106,blc1234,"I deal with this exact same thing and it's absolutely awful. That specific anxiety-nausea is so different from regular stomach issues - it's like your insides are trying to crawl out of your body. And you're right, it's incredibly frustrating when people suggest simple fixes like ginger tea or deep breathing when it feels so much more intense than that.

The gut-brain connection with anxiety is really powerful, and you're not alone in experiencing this as your worst symptom. I've found that just knowing others go through the same thing helps a tiny bit - not because it fixes anything, but because it validates that this is a real, physical response and not just ""being dramatic"" about worry.

I hear you about therapy/medication experiences not being great in the past. That really sucks. While I won't push suggestions since you specifically said you don't want them, I just want you to know your feelings are valid and this symptom is a legitimate struggle. Sometimes just being heard and understood can provide a small measure of relief when dealing with something this challenging.","

The ""point and order"" method is actually pretty great - some of my favorite food discoveries have happened by just randomly trying something new. How did the pretzel turn out?

Keep riding this confidence wave! Maybe next time you'll feel brave enough to ask questions about the menu or try striking up a tiny conversation with the server. But even if you just keep pointing at random items, that's totally fine too. Every little victory counts when it comes to building confidence.

Even the ones I enjoy. It‚Äôs not an anxiety thing for me, because I‚Äôm comfortable socializing, it‚Äôs just tiring. I always build time into my schedule  to decompress and recharge by myself.

You might be an introvert.

Working seven hours straight without breaks is also itself a challenge though.",146,InTheFlesk,,0,,"This sounds really overwhelming, especially as your first job! What you're describing is a classic case of social battery drain, and it's completely normal - especially for people who tend to be more introverted. I experienced something similar when I first started working in customer service.

A few things that helped me cope:
- Taking mini ""mental breaks"" even if just 30 seconds between customers (deep breaths, quick stretch)
- Having a solid decompression routine after work (headphones on the commute home, quiet time alone)
- Reminding myself that it's okay to keep interactions professional but brief
- Making sure my days off are low-social activities to recharge

Also, please know that the first few weeks of any customer service job are extra draining because you're learning so much at once. It does get easier as you develop routines and build confidence in handling different situations.

Have you talked to your supervisor about getting proper breaks? It's usually legally required and really important for your wellbeing. Hang in there - what you're feeling is valid and more common than you might think! üíú","

It's amazing how we often don't realize how much tension we're holding in our bodies until someone points it out. I literally just unclenched my jaw and dropped my shoulders while reading this, and it's incredible how much physical stress I was carrying without even noticing.

These little moments of mindfulness are so valuable, especially during busy or stressful times. I've started setting random reminders on my phone to do exactly this kind of body scan and breathing exercise. It's such a simple thing, but it makes such a difference in how I feel throughout the day.

For anyone reading this who struggles with remembering to take these breaks: try associating this relaxation routine with something you do regularly, like checking your phone or taking a sip of water. It helps make it a natural habit rather than something else on your to-do list.

Thanks for being a caring voice in this community. We all need these reminders sometimes.","

a0k03f,Anxiety,A cool anxiety technique I learned,theWinterDojer,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!",904,75,1543244207,Love this.   And testing the theory ,65,palmcitytiki,Thanks!  I'm willing to try just about anything. ,2,NiceIce,"This is such a great visualization technique, thank you for sharing! I especially love how you made it personal with the red spiky ball example - it really helps understand how to put this into practice.

I've used similar methods before, but never thought to actually transform the anxiety shape into something calmer. Usually I just try to push it away, which doesn't work nearly as well. The idea of actively changing its properties feels much more empowering.

The smiling tip is brilliant too. It reminds me of how our physical state can influence our mental state - like how power poses can actually make us feel more confident. I'm definitely going to try combining the visualization with a smile next time my anxiety kicks in.

For anyone trying this: don't get discouraged if it takes practice. Like any coping technique, it gets easier and more effective the more you use it. Thanks again for sharing such a practical tool!","

cfbfvy,Anxiety,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,dumbjokes101,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it",929,49,1563561893,"this is the type of wholesome content I needed today. 

Hold that boy close and never let him go.",264,slayinscience,,0,,"That's such a wonderful and supportive response from your boyfriend! As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how vulnerable and scary it can feel to have an attack in front of a partner for the first time. The fact that he instinctively knew how to comfort you - following your lead on physical touch, staying calm, and even getting the dog involved - shows real emotional intelligence.

It's completely normal to worry about how a partner will react to seeing this side of you. But sometimes these moments, though difficult, can actually strengthen a relationship because they allow your partner to show up for you in meaningful ways. 

The way he handled it suggests he really cares about understanding and supporting you through tough moments. That's a great foundation for a healthy relationship. Maybe when you're feeling up to it, you could have a conversation about what helps most during anxiety attacks, so he can be even better prepared if it happens again.

I'm glad you found someone who responds with such care and understanding. You deserve that kind of support! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it

or3og2,Anxiety,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,BeginningIcy3816,"It‚Äôs so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It‚Äôs just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I‚Äôve made immense progress but it‚Äôs never going to be normal again. I can‚Äôt stop feeling guilty for everything I‚Äôve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I‚Äôm worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can‚Äôt let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn‚Äôt even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I‚Äôm tired of thoughts that I‚Äôm a horrible person. I‚Äôm just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I‚Äôm in a group of people having fun. And I‚Äôm able to make them laugh. Whenever I‚Äôm alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I‚Äôm worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there‚Äôs gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It‚Äôs just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I‚Äôm kinda thinking this might be because I‚Äôve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I‚Äôm so nervous I can‚Äôt stop hyper focusing on one situation and it‚Äôs been a year and it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors.",920,58,1627181851,"You aren't high maintenance. You have anxiety. Your brain is lying to you, but you don't know that in the moment. I've been there. I thought those thoughts were normal. I thought it was normal to constantly think others were talking about me. I thought it was normal to relive conversations from years ago. I thought it was normal to constantly worry about whether my boyfriend (now husband) actually loved me.

The only thing that truly helped was medication. A daily med as well as a rescue med for anxiety attacks. The right meds and the right dosage made a world of difference for me. The vast majority of those thoughts stopped or were at least easier to manage. I'm currently off medication and doing well, but there is no shame in medication.",108,readrunrescue,[deleted],14,[deleted],"First off, I totally understand these feelings - constantly worrying about others being mad at you is exhausting, and that need for reassurance is so real. The fact that you've recognized this pattern and are making progress is actually huge.

The edit about missing anxiety meds is really important - that can definitely amplify these thoughts and feelings. Getting back on track with your medication should help level things out. In the meantime, maybe try redirecting those checking behaviors into something more sustainable? Instead of checking if people blocked you, maybe text a friend to make actual plans, or channel that energy into a hobby you enjoy (beyond just browsing Mercari).

It sounds like you're dealing with some anxiety and possibly RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) - these are real things that many people struggle with, and you're not ""high maintenance"" for experiencing them. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you develop better coping strategies than constantly seeking reassurance from others.

Remember - most people are too focused on their own lives to be holding onto things from years ago. Be kind to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

But sometimes I just want to do nothing. I'm tired of feeling like I have to catch up or move ahead in some race all the time. Life is just not enjoyable when I'm constantly running on anxiety.,117,MagicCandy,,0,,"I totally get this feeling - that constant nagging anxiety about making every minute count can actually end up being counterproductive and stressful. I struggled with this too and realized I was spending more time worrying about wasting time than actually living.

Something that helped me was reframing what ""productive time"" means. Rest, relaxation, and even seemingly ""unproductive"" activities are actually essential for our wellbeing and can make us more effective when we do focus on tasks. Not every moment needs to be optimized.

Try starting small - maybe block out specific times for tasks/activities while deliberately scheduling in breaks and downtime. This can help you feel more in control while acknowledging that it's okay (and necessary) to have periods where you're not actively ""doing"" something.

Remember that being anxious about time is a common experience, but don't let that anxiety steal your present moments. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is give yourself permission to just be.","

The caffeine and other stimulants in energy drinks can definitely trigger anxiety symptoms and make them way worse. What you're experiencing - the shaking, rushing emotions, and weakness - is likely your body's heightened fight-or-flight response combined with the stimulants.

Try these things to help calm down:
- Take slow, deep breaths (4 seconds in, hold 4, out 4)
- Drink plenty of water to help flush your system
- Walk around slowly if you can, or lie down if you're too shaky
- Remember: this WILL pass as the drink wears off

For future reference, if you need an energy boost, try alternatives like green tea or small amounts of regular coffee, which are gentler on your system. Energy drinks can be really intense even for people without anxiety!

Hang in there - the effects should start wearing off in a few hours. If you're really worried or symptoms get worse, don't hesitate to call your doctor or a nurse hotline. üíú","

jb4pzf,Anxiety,I finally talked to my doctor about anxiety -he told me to try a meditation app.,FacelessOldWoman1234,"I've had anxiety for years and it's been getting worse and worse. Finally I got up the courage to call my doctor. I told him everything, and went through some questionnaires with him.  He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal."" 

I feel really discouraged.

Edit: Thank you for the perspective, advice, and support. I think that those of you who suggested that the doctor is just starting at the bottom of the treatment ladder are correct. I have otherwise had good experiences with this doctor, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I do think however that he could have done better than just suggest I use a different app to do something I already indicated wasn't working. It felt really dismissive, and sent me down a bit of a spiral. I will try again (although I already worry I'll just fail at it and it will be one more failure for the books), and I'll work on my sleep hygiene myself. Again, thank you for the support.",735,242,1602695049,"That sucks, and I can see why you don't feel listened to.

Giving the app a go might not be a bad idea.

You're within your rights to ask for another opinion, from a different doctor. Even if 6 hours of sleep is deemed normal, it is still affecting your wellbeing and should therefore be taken seriously.

You deserve to have your concerns heard and treated as important.",308,meekomania,Any doctor that says 6 hours of sleep a night is enough is not educated enough to hold the title of doctor imo. I would seek a second opinion from a doctor that knows what they are doing,6,pritch_dawg,"I totally understand your frustration. It can take so much courage to finally ask for help, and getting what feels like a dismissive ""just try an app"" response is really discouraging - especially when you've already explained that mindfulness alone hasn't been working.

That said, doctors often start with the most conservative treatments first before moving to medication or other interventions. This might be his way of establishing a baseline before exploring other options. If you try the app and it's still not helping after a month, you'll have clear evidence to say ""I followed your recommendation but I need something more.""

In the meantime, could you perhaps look for a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can work with you on practical coping strategies and may also be able to advocate for you with your doctor if needed. And don't feel bad about scheduling another appointment sooner if things get worse - you deserve support in managing this, especially as a parent.

Hang in there. The first step is often the hardest, but you've already taken it by reaching out for help.","

hn7wgd,Anxiety,"Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an ""event""...ANY event?",Cautious-Discount,"Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?",917,60,1594172541,[deleted],102,[deleted],Would you care to talk about how you cope with your anxiety?,1,cleverbeavercleaver,"This definitely sounds like anxiety rather than excitement. That tight chest and sinking stomach feeling is a classic anxiety response, even when there's nothing obviously stressful happening. Our bodies can develop these automatic responses to any kind of ""event"" or change in routine, even supposedly positive ones like birthdays.

It's completely understandable that you experience this, and you're definitely not alone. Many people get anxious about birthdays specifically because there can be unspoken expectations or complicated feelings around them, especially if you have a complex relationship with celebrating yourself or family dynamics.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They could help you develop tools to manage these physical symptoms and explore why even neutral events trigger this response. In the meantime, some gentle breathing exercises when you wake up with that feeling might help - just focusing on slow, deep breaths for a few minutes can help calm your nervous system.

Remember, there's nothing ""weird"" about what you're experiencing. It's a very human response, and it's okay to need support in managing it.","

For reconnecting with friends, you could start with a simple text message rather than jumping straight into meetups.

The truth is, many people at gyms and social gatherings are dealing with their own anxieties too - we're just not always aware of it. Sometimes accepting that anxiety might always be present, but learning to work alongside it rather than waiting for it to vanish, can be really liberating.

What's one tiny step you could take this week toward one of these goals? Sometimes the smallest actions can help build momentum.","

Social anxiety can make even the simplest interactions feel like climbing a mountain, and posting online - where everything feels permanent and open to judgment - can be especially daunting.

Something that helped me was realizing that most Redditors are just regular people sharing their thoughts, making mistakes, and learning as they go. Nobody starts out as an expert poster. Plus, the beauty of Reddit is that you can start small - maybe commenting on others' posts first, then working your way up to your own posts when you feel ready.

As someone who has struggled with anxiety, I know exactly how convincing that inner voice can be. It's like having a pessimistic narrator constantly trying to rewrite your story with worst-case scenarios.

I especially appreciate the point about how ""no one gives a shit how you do things."" It's so true - we often paralyze ourselves thinking everyone is judging our every move, when in reality, most people are too focused on their own lives to notice.

One thing I've learned is that anxiety doesn't have to completely disappear for us to move forward. Sometimes it's about taking action while being anxious, and proving to yourself that you can do things even when you're scared. Each small win builds evidence against those anxious thoughts.

For anyone reading this who's in the thick of anxiety right now: Your anxiety is a liar with really good PR skills. Don't let it convince you that its predictions are facts. You've survived 100% of your worst days so far - you're stronger than you think.","

edx16n,Anxiety,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,DevilAngel9,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.

Merry Christmas guys x",942,29,1576970597,"I'm happy for you as well, Merry Christmas",21,beanstalkbaby,"Hearing this has made me a little happier.

Well done!",5,AHippyInLeeds,"This is incredibly inspiring - congratulations on one whole year! As someone who has also struggled with self-harm, I know exactly how massive this achievement is. Every single day clean is a victory.

I really appreciate what you said about not having to be ""ill enough"" to deserve help. That mindset kept me from seeking support for way too long. And you're so right about mental health becoming part of our identity - letting go of those harmful coping mechanisms can feel scary because they've been with us for so long.

The way you've reframed your relationship with anxiety and found gratitude in your growth is beautiful. You're proof that while recovery isn't always linear and mental health challenges may always be present, we can learn to cope in healthier ways and find joy again.

Keep celebrating these milestones - you've earned every moment of pride. Your message will definitely help others who are still in the thick of it. Wishing you a peaceful and happy Christmas! üéÑ","

Your words about the storms really resonated with me. It's easy to forget during the tough times that better days are ahead. I've learned that those moments of sunshine you mentioned are even more beautiful because we know what it took to get there.

And you know what? You're amazing too. Taking the time to write such a heartfelt message to lift up complete strangers - that's the kind of kindness that makes the world a better place. Thank you for being that light for others today.

f1t9o0,Anxiety,"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.",ladythescottishplay,"I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.",916,54,1581354368,"You just said everything I‚Äôm feeling right now.

I hope we both feel better soon.",90,ilikefluffypuppies,"You just said everything I‚Äôm feeling right now. I made it to work this  morning but the ‚Äúsomethings wrong‚Äù feeling just got worse and worse, and then i didn‚Äôt know how to tell my supervisor i needed to leave because I‚Äôd had a smile plastered to my face all morning. 

I hope we both feel better soon.",90,ilikefluffypuppies,"I hear you, and what you're feeling is completely valid. That constant pressure to ""keep it together"" when you're falling apart inside is exhausting, and it's unfair that mental health struggles aren't given the same consideration as physical illness in most workplaces.

While we can't change society overnight, please know that it's okay to set boundaries and take care of yourself. Even small acts of self-preservation matter - can you take a mental health day soon? Or block out just 30 minutes tonight to decompress before tackling chores? Sometimes ""being strong"" actually means acknowledging when we need to pause and rest.

I'm glad you have a supportive partner. Let them help carry some of the load right now. You don't have to handle everything perfectly all the time. The world won't fall apart if you take a step back to breathe.

Also, have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help develop coping strategies for anxiety and validate that it's okay to not always be okay. Sending you strength and hoping you can find some moments of peace today. üíú","

I like to think of it this way: if someone has diabetes, we don't tell them they're ""failing"" by taking insulin. Mental health medication is no different - it's a tool that helps our bodies function better, plain and simple.

The part about being able to laugh again really hit home. It's amazing how medication can help lift that heavy fog and let us actually experience joy instead of just going through the motions. You're doing what's best for your health and quality of life, and that's something to be proud of, not ashamed of.

Quick tip from someone who's been driving for a while: those nervous feelings are actually good for new drivers because they keep you alert and careful. Just remember that confidence will build naturally with time and experience. Don't feel pressured to drive in challenging conditions (like heavy rain or busy highways) until you feel ready.

The freedom of having your license is amazing - enjoy this milestone! You've earned it. Just remember to stay focused when driving, even as it becomes more routine. And don't worry if you still feel a bit nervous sometimes - that's totally normal when you're first starting out.

Drive safe and enjoy your new independence! üöó","

I've found that keeping a ""wins journal"" helps shift this mindset. At the end of each day, I write down 2-3 things that went well, no matter how small. Even on rough days, maybe I just made a good cup of coffee or helped someone with directions. It trains your brain to spot the positive moments instead of fixating on the negative ones.

The part about breaking negative cycles really hits home too. It's like wearing dark sunglasses - everything looks gloomy until you take them off and realize the world is actually pretty bright. Sometimes we just need to consciously change our perspective.

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know exactly how huge those victories are - especially conquering highway driving AND a first date in the same day. That's like anxiety boss battle x2!

The fact that you two ended up talking for 4 hours after dinner is such a great sign. When conversation flows that naturally, it usually means there's a real connection there. And don't worry about the stuttering - most people find a little nervousness on a first date pretty endearing because it shows you actually care.

Keep riding this momentum! Each time you push through your anxiety and have a positive experience like this, it gets a little easier for the next time. You're proving to yourself that you can handle these situations, even if they feel scary at first.

Congrats on scoring that second date! Hope it goes even better than the first one. üéâ","

",66,SkinnyHobbit,I've snapped at colleagues and I always try to apologize. It takes a lot of work to keep your work environment pleasant! ,3,katie-shmatie,"Thank you for posting this. I really needed to hear it today. Just last week I had to lock myself in the bathroom for 10 minutes to pull myself together after a particularly rough meeting. It's so easy to feel like you're the only one struggling or that you're somehow ""unprofessional"" for having these moments.

Something that's helped me is keeping a ""wins"" folder in my email - any positive feedback, successful projects, or even small victories. On those tough days when imposter syndrome hits hard or after an emotional moment, it helps to look back and remember that these rough patches don't define our entire work experience.

Also, please remember that seeking help isn't weakness - whether that's talking to a therapist, confiding in a trusted colleague, or even just taking a mental health day when you need it. We're humans first, employees second.

To everyone reading this who's had one of those days: you're not alone, and you're doing better than you think you are. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

l90tb8,Anxiety,Today is my twelfth day sleeping on time and eating all 5 meals,ATNeri,"Well, 2 weeks ago I made a post on this sub, venting a bit what was going through my mind at the time.
I was very anxious and stressed, eating poorly and very little even sometimes just once a day. My nights were very particular, sometimes sleeping less than 4 hours a day every day.

Today concludes the second week in which I sleep early and wake up comfortably. Besides complying with 5 meals a day, especially breakfast which I missed SO MUCH.

Getting back into healthy routines with sleep, meals, and activities is incredibly challenging when you've been in a rough patch. The fact that you've maintained this for two weeks shows real commitment.

I love that you're not just focusing on the basics like food and sleep, but also getting back to things that bring you joy like guitar and chess. Those activities are so important for mental wellbeing.

One tip that helped me maintain positive changes was tracking my progress in a simple journal - just quick notes about sleep, meals, and activities. On harder days, looking back at how far I'd come really helped keep me motivated.

Keep taking it one day at a time. You've already proven you can make meaningful changes, and that positive mindset will serve you well as you head back to work. Rooting for your continued success! üí™","

b2b1t3,Anxiety,Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,TheLittlestDandelion,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure. Do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?",851,115,1552862579,"I've recently become aware that I have an issue with competing noises or background noises.   They make me bonkers.  For example - if my kids are playing on a tablet and my husband has the TV on or if we're driving and listening to a podcast but someone is also trying to get to tell me something. Or if the baby starts crying while music is playing.    
Ugh.   ",154,eyeshadowANDcoffee,,0,,"I totally get this - I have similar issues with sudden loud noises and it can be really challenging to deal with. What you're describing sounds like misophonia or hyperacusis, which are pretty common, especially for people with anxiety.

Have you considered trying noise-canceling headphones? They've been a game-changer for me in situations where I know there might be triggering sounds. You can also try exposure therapy techniques (working with a therapist is best for this), where you gradually get used to certain sounds in a controlled environment.

For situations you can't avoid, deep breathing exercises right before and during the noise can help reduce the anxiety response. I also find it helpful to remind myself that while the sound is unpleasant, it's temporary and I'm safe.

Don't feel bad about avoiding certain situations either - it's okay to step outside during fire alarm tests or ask friends to keep balloons away from you at parties. Most people are understanding when you explain it calmly.

You're definitely not alone in this - it's a real challenge that many people face!","

Compulsive thoughts are ruining my life,10,Owelet182,"I totally understand what you're going through - it's like your brain is a problem-seeking missile that's always on high alert. This ""problem hopping"" is actually really common with anxiety, where as soon as one worry is resolved, your mind immediately starts scanning for the next thing to stress about.

Something that's helped me is recognizing this as a pattern rather than treating each worry as a separate emergency. When I catch my mind doing this, I try to step back and say ""Ah, there's my anxiety brain doing its thing again"" instead of getting caught up in the specific worry.

Have you tried mindfulness techniques? They can help you observe these thoughts without getting tangled up in them. Also, writing down your worries can help - sometimes seeing them on paper makes it easier to recognize when you're catastrophizing.

It's great that you're in therapy - that's a huge step! Your therapist can probably help you develop more specific strategies for your situation. Remember, you're not broken - your brain is just being overprotective, and with practice, you can learn to manage these thought patterns better.","

Physically I get tremors, so I end up typing some wild chaos instead of the simple, human text I meant to get to. I can‚Äôt focus to read, either; I get really jittery and it‚Äôs like the last thing I wanna do is be tied up on reading.",79,wonderlessbread,,0,,"Yes, this is absolutely a common symptom of anxiety! When we're anxious, our brain is in ""fight or flight"" mode, which makes it really difficult to focus on tasks like reading and writing. I experience this too - sometimes I'll read the same sentence five times and still not process it, or completely blank on how to spell basic words.

It happens because anxiety takes up a lot of our cognitive resources. When your brain is busy dealing with stress and worry, it has less capacity for other mental tasks. Think of it like having too many browser tabs open - everything starts running slower.

Some things that help me:
- Taking deep breaths before trying to read/write
- Breaking text into smaller chunks
- Reading out loud when I'm struggling to focus
- Being patient with myself and taking breaks when needed

Don't be too hard on yourself when this happens. It's a normal response to anxiety and usually improves once you're feeling calmer. If it's happening frequently though, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional about anxiety management strategies.","

85r9nl,Anxiety,does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?,unicornbottle,"One of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. I fear getting scolded more than I fear my future career. Even if I know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, I get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. 

I was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. After that one encounter, I was so scared that I would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice. ",845,120,1521536451,I've always been afraid of getting yelled at. Even if someone just raises their voice just a little bit I get teary eyed. It makes me feel so useless. ,285,HikikomoriOnnanoko,"My father used to smack me on the head. Nobody, in those days, though anything of it. I must have done something to deserve it.

Into my 30's I flinched whenever someone raised there hand to brush their hair, scratch an itchy ear, etc. 

I soon realized that it was a reflexive response to a repeated stimulus. 

I used to wish be would beat me so people would see me as the victim. I still have this desire today. 

We are hard-wired to survive at any cost. We are abused during our most vulnerable early years. We learn to adapt our behavior to stay in the group. No group, no food, shelter, Mazlow's hierarchy of needs stuff.

Think about it. What three-year child old can say ""this is crazy, I don't deserve this and I'm leaving. You adapt to your situation to survive. If surviving means you have to turn that anger inward then that is what will happen. If survival means staying in a crazy home then that is what you will do.

Some escape but most don't. The cycle repeats. ",13,builder17,"I totally understand this fear - it's actually a really common trauma response, especially if you've had experiences with harsh authority figures in the past. That incident with your coach clearly left a deep impact, and it's completely valid that it affected you so strongly.

What you're describing sounds a lot like rejection sensitivity or authority-related anxiety. The good news is that this is something you can work on! Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? They can help you develop coping strategies and gradually work through these fears.

In the meantime, try reminding yourself of experiences like the one with your understanding boss - it shows that not everyone reacts with anger, and many people are actually quite reasonable. Maybe keep a little list of times when you were worried about getting yelled at but it turned out fine. It can help challenge that automatic fear response.

Remember, your worth isn't determined by other people's reactions, and making mistakes is a normal part of being human. You deserve to feel safe and comfortable in your daily life without this constant anxiety hanging over you.","

Bathrooms are like universal safe spaces - they're everywhere, completely normal to use, and one of the few places where it's socially acceptable to be alone for a few minutes without explanation.

I do the same thing at work and social events when I need a breather. Something about that private space helps reset your mind when things get overwhelming. Deep breathing, splashing some cold water on your face, and just having a moment to gather your thoughts can make a huge difference.

As for the in-laws situation - maybe casually mention sometime that you occasionally get migraines or that fluorescent lights bother you? That way you have a ""cover story"" that's less awkward than them assuming digestive issues. Though honestly, most people are too wrapped up in their own stuff to analyze your bathroom habits too deeply.

You're definitely not alone in using this coping strategy. It's a totally valid way to practice self-care and manage anxiety in the moment. Keep doing what works for you!","

It's especially frustrating when you've already tried many of the typical recommendations.

Something that helped me reframe this: Instead of seeing anxiety as ""wasting"" your life, try to accept that managing anxiety IS part of your life right now. Fighting against it or beating yourself up often makes it worse. It's like quicksand - the more you struggle, the deeper you sink.

Have you tried ""floating"" with the anxiety instead? When those morning sensations hit, try acknowledging them with ""Oh hey, there's my anxiety showing up again"" rather than ""Oh no, not this again!"" It sounds counterintuitive, but accepting its presence (while not letting it drive the car) can actually reduce its power over time.

Also, please be gentle with yourself. You're not failing or wasting time - you're dealing with a real challenge that many people face. Your worth isn't measured by how productive or anxiety-free you are on any given day.","

I tried to think of something cool to say, to brush it off and be tough, but all I could do was close the stream and leave.

i'm tempted to go back to his twitch channel and watch the clip again but i know it's just going to make me feel even worse.",9,IiteraIIy,"I totally get this. It's like these small negative interactions have this weird power to hijack your entire emotional state, while others seem to just brush them off and move on. You're definitely not alone in this.

Something that's helped me is realizing that being sensitive to others' behaviors isn't actually a weakness - it often means you're empathetic and aware. The challenge is finding the right balance between being aware and not letting it consume you.

A technique that works for me is the ""future self"" check: I ask myself ""Will this matter in a week? A month? A year?"" Usually, the answer is no. Those people who seemed to be whispering about you? They've probably already forgotten about it.

Also, try to remember that most negative interactions aren't really about you - that angry client is probably stressed about something else, that insensitive comment might come from someone's own insecurities.

It takes practice, but you can gradually build up your resilience without losing your empathetic nature. Be patient with yourself - you're not ""too sensitive,"" you're just working on finding your balance.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else hate how easily other people can ruin your day?

POST BODY:  A phone call with an angry client, a threatening email from a third party, a slightly insensitive comment, people stopping their conversations when you walk past...

I'm fairly certain that my peers cope with these things just fine. But almost every time they happen to me my day is ruined and I have to constantly seek reassurance from people that everything is alright.

I wish I could learn to just let go of these things instead of them going around my head like a sock in a washing machine for the rest of the day...

The best part is that you not only pushed through your comfort zone, but you actually enjoyed yourself! That's going to make future solo adventures so much easier because now you have this positive experience to look back on.

Don't forget to take a moment to really appreciate how far you've come. Each of these things - driving far, eating alone, and attending an event solo - would be an achievement on its own. You knocked out all three in one day!

It makes no sense to go to work if you're unable to physically function, so it's a good idea to skip work if you're unable to mentally function. Take a day to breathe, sleep in, and focus on what you can control in your home.",23,JibJig,"I totally get those days where anxiety hits you before you even get out of bed. Change and confrontation are two huge anxiety triggers for many people, so dealing with both at once must feel really overwhelming right now.

For the immediate anxiety symptoms, try the 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. It helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system and can make that ""can't breathe"" feeling more manageable.

About the changes - remember that your husband starting a new job, while stressful now, will settle into a new normal soon. As for the work situation, try to remind yourself that most workplace ""beef"" blows over pretty quickly. People usually forget about small incidents faster than we think.

Would it help to write down what you're worried about? Sometimes getting it on paper makes it feel more manageable. And don't hesitate to lean on your husband for support - you're both navigating changes right now.

Sending you good vibes. These anxious days suck, but they do pass. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

And you're right - we're definitely not alone in this. Modern life has us all carrying tension somewhere, whether it's jaw clenching during work calls or shoulder-scrunching while checking emails. These little moments of awareness and release are so important.

It's like your body goes into fight-or-flight mode before anything even happens.

While you're stuck in this job for now, there are a few things that helped me manage similar work anxiety:

- Create morning routines that ground you before logging in (10 min meditation, coffee outside, quick walk)
- Keep a ""wins"" folder with positive feedback/accomplishments to look at when you're spiraling
- Set boundaries around work hours and notifications if possible
- Practice reframing those ""what if"" thoughts (most worst-case scenarios never actually happen)

And remember - those anxiety signals don't always predict reality accurately. Our brains can get stuck in negative prediction loops from past experiences.

Totally valid that you can't leave right now, but maybe start casually looking and updating your resume? Having an exit strategy, even a long-term one, can help you feel more in control.

Love that you took your vitamins too. It's like once you get that first win, other little victories start falling into place. Those small acts of self-care really do add up.

If you're looking for easy ways to keep the momentum going, I found that keeping granola bars or trail mix nearby helped on the rough days when cooking felt overwhelming. And staying hydrated makes a big difference too.

It's totally normal to feel like everyone's watching you when you're alone in public, but you discovered what many people eventually realize - most people are way too focused on their own stuff to pay attention to others.

About the job application - many places now actually prefer online applications first. You could check the store's website or job sites like Indeed to apply. That way, when you do go in person, you can say ""Hi, I submitted an application online and wanted to follow up!"" It gives you a concrete reason to be there and can make that first step feel less intimidating.

Just like you conquered eating alone at McDonald's by focusing on your food and phone, you can handle the job thing one small step at a time. Today it was lunch, tomorrow it might be dropping off an application. You're already proving to yourself that you can do these things! üí™","

It's not pathetic at all - anxiety can hit anyone, regardless of age or gender, and it can be incredibly physically intense.

For immediate relief: Try taking slow, deep breaths (4 counts in, hold for 4, out for 4). Sip water slowly. If you can, find a quiet spot and try grounding exercises - name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, etc.

Please tell your mom what's happening. I know it might feel awkward, but this is exactly the kind of thing parents should know about. You might need to see a doctor to rule out any physical issues and discuss options for managing anxiety. There's absolutely no shame in getting help.

In the meantime, know that while panic attacks feel terrible, they can't actually harm you. They always pass, even though it doesn't feel like it in the moment. You're not alone in this - many people deal with anxiety, and there are effective ways to manage it.","

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay!

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how challenging it can be to push through those fears, especially when dealing with medication concerns and bipolar disorder at the same time.

I'm really glad you're prioritizing your health by getting vaccinated, but please don't hesitate to take your prescribed Ativan if you need it - the vaccine and benzos don't interact, and managing your anxiety is important too. Vaccine side effects like arm soreness and dizziness are totally normal and should pass within a few days.

The next couple weeks might be tough without your regular meds, but you've already shown incredible strength getting through this far. Consider reaching out to your clinic if your symptoms become difficult to manage - even with your regular doctor away, they should have resources to help you.

That ""autopilot"" feeling and cognitive fog are textbook symptoms.

I dealt with similar symptoms for years - the constant feeling of being ""off,"" struggling to form coherent thoughts, and constantly worrying that doctors were missing something serious. The hypochondria just feeds into the anxiety cycle, making everything feel worse.

A few things that helped me:
- Accepting that these ARE anxiety symptoms (even though they feel so ""physical"")
- Regular exercise to burn off excess stress hormones
- Mindfulness practices (even just 5 minutes/day)
- Working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety

While it feels permanent when you're in it, these symptoms can and do improve with proper treatment. Consider talking to a mental health professional who can properly assess you and provide targeted strategies. Hang in there - you're not losing your mind, even though it sometimes feels that way.","

POST TITLE: Does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?

POST BODY: I know it is a mental illness in itself but I‚Äôm talking about constantly feeling ‚Äúoff‚Äù.. like way less intelligent than you used to be, hard to process your thoughts in to words so they come out jumbled or silly sounding, constant headaches and just feeling like you‚Äôre on autopilot looking in to someone else‚Äôs life.. Idk I‚Äôve been dealing with this for 2+ years and I still find it hard to believe it‚Äôs just anxiety. I‚Äôm terrified it is something else that the doctor‚Äôs are missing which I‚Äôm sure is just anxiety fueled hypochondria lol.

Whatever you're going through right now that's making you feel this way, it's valid. Life can really pile it on sometimes and make us feel like we're drowning in it all.

If you want to talk about what's specifically got you at your wit's end, this community is here to listen. No judgment. Sometimes just putting it into words can help take some of the pressure off.

In the meantime, try to take a few deep breaths. Go punch a pillow, take a walk, blast some angry music - whatever helps you release some of that tension in a safe way. This moment sucks, but it won't last forever.

Hang in there, friend. You've got people in your corner.","

9ou4f3,Anxiety,The Biggest Problem With Anxiety is that It's Hard to Tell When Problems You're Having is ACTUALLY Caused by Anxiety,svrtngr,"Case in point:

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a tension-like headache for two fucking weeks and none of the doctors I've seen know what's causing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anxiety? Could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Not anxiety? Could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Brain tumor? Probably. (This is a joke, but you guys probably get it.)

&amp;#x200B;

That's just making the anxiety worse. ",854,102,1539741057,"Oh lord yes.  I have palpitations all the time.  As far as I know, not actual heart disease.  But maybe THIS time it is!  

Also don't even get me started on whether or not I really have hypertension and how bad it really is.",138,withbellson,"I have both sinus headaches and anxiety/stress headaches.

It took me forever to be able to tell the difference. (Anxiety is about everywhere, sinusitis causes pain around your eyes and nose)

Sometimes both of them even happen at the same time! It so annoying to try to solve the problem when you don‚Äôt even what‚Äôs causing.

It is getting better but it can still be so confusing...",5,LightningBolt_12,"I totally get this frustrating cycle. It's like anxiety creates physical symptoms, then we worry about those symptoms, which creates more anxiety, and round and round we go. It's especially maddening with something like a persistent headache because it COULD be anxiety... or not... and that uncertainty just feeds the beast.

Something that's helped me is keeping a symptom diary - tracking when things get better or worse and what's happening in my life at those times. It helps me spot patterns and gives me more concrete info to work with, both for my own peace of mind and to share with doctors.

Also, don't be afraid to get a second opinion if you're really worried. Sometimes just hearing ""this is most likely anxiety, and here's why"" from a medical professional can be incredibly relieving. But they should still take your concerns seriously and rule out other causes - that's their job.

Hang in there. Anxiety is a master of making us question everything, but you're not alone in this struggle. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

The pandemic has thrown a massive wrench into all our usual coping mechanisms and routines, and it's totally normal for anxiety to spike during times like these - even if you've previously had it under control.

Even tiny things like making my bed or having my morning coffee by a window can help ground me. Also, try to be extra gentle with yourself right now - we're all living through an incredibly challenging time.

Have you considered virtual therapy sessions? Many therapists have moved online, and it might help to have professional support during this period. Additionally, finding ways to safely connect with others (video calls, socially distanced walks if possible) can make a big difference.

Remember that feeling this way doesn't erase all the progress you've made with managing your anxiety. This is just an exceptionally difficult situation, and it's okay to struggle sometimes. Hang in there - this won't last forever.","

rjoobk,Anxiety,I‚Äôm graduating from my masters program and no one cares,ladymemedaddy,"So I‚Äôm graduating with my Masters at the end of December, but I finish classes in a few days. I also graduated college class of 2020 and spent my graduating sitting on my couch crying because I was so sad. I decided to try to let it go, since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn‚Äôt. Now, it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I‚Äôm happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn‚Äôt been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can‚Äôt even do that, and I don‚Äôt want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven‚Äôt been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don‚Äôt know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there‚Äôs nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it‚Äôs causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Here's what I'd suggest: Plan your own celebration for sometime after the wedding chaos dies down. Maybe in February? You could organize a nice dinner with your closest friends, get dressed up, make toasts, and properly commemorate your achievement. Sometimes we have to create our own moments to shine, and that's okay.

Also, please know that your feelings are valid. It's not selfish to want recognition for something you worked so hard for. Your sister's wedding is important, but so is your graduation. Both deserve their moment.

I'm a random internet stranger, but I'm genuinely proud of you. Getting a Masters degree is no small feat, and you did it during an incredibly challenging time. That shows real dedication and perseverance. Hold your head high - you've earned it! üéâ","

That's not a ""little"" victory at all - it's massive progress! Those deep breaths and sitting down were exactly the right moves.

It's especially encouraging that you're seeing this as proof that you can overcome these challenges. Because you absolutely can. Each time you face a fear and make it through, like you did today, you're building evidence that you're stronger than your anxiety wants you to believe.

I dealt with something very similar - feeling like I couldn't get a full breath even though all my medical tests were normal. The tricky thing about anxiety is that it can manifest physically even when you don't feel mentally anxious. It's like your body can be in ""anxiety mode"" while your mind feels fine.

What helped me was learning diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) and reminding myself that I was getting enough oxygen, even if it didn't feel like it. The more I focused on and worried about my breathing, the worse it got. A low dose of an SSRI also helped break the cycle for me.

Have you considered working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you specific techniques to manage this symptom. Also, the fact that you can play sports without issues is actually a really good sign that this is anxiety-related rather than a physical problem.

Hang in there - this is a really frustrating symptom but it can definitely get better with the right support and tools.","

If you believe in karma, balance the scales.",113,postedonacloud,"Done it. It happens. If you believe in karma, balance the scales.",113,postedonacloud,"Yes, I totally understand this feeling! I've had similar moments where stress got the better of me and I snapped at someone undeservingly. That immediate wave of guilt afterwards is really uncomfortable, and it's actually a good thing - it shows you have empathy and know your behavior wasn't okay.

While it's natural to worry about ""karma"" coming back to get you, try to reframe this as a learning moment rather than something that needs cosmic punishment. We're all human and sometimes our emotions get the best of us. The fact that you feel genuine remorse shows you're a good person who had a bad moment, not a bad person.

If you can't apologize directly, maybe channel that guilt into being extra kind to the next few people you interact with. This can help balance out your emotional ledger and remind you that one negative interaction doesn't define who you are.

Be gentle with yourself - high stress can make anyone act out of character. Maybe this is also a sign to look at your stress management strategies and see if you need some better coping tools.","

I didn't have a chance to apologize to this person and now I'm worried something terrible will happen to me because of my stupid action.

",1,pineapplepegasus,"I totally get those moments - when your brain just completely blanks on the most basic words! It's actually really common and happens to pretty much everyone, even when speaking their native language. Try not to beat yourself up about it.

If it helps, I once asked for ""bread tubes"" instead of ""hot dog buns"" at the grocery store, and my friend still brings it up years later as a funny memory. These little language hiccups often make for great stories later, even if they feel mortifying in the moment.

Pro tip for future orders: Most fast food places have menu boards or apps you can point to if words escape you. And honestly, the workers have probably heard way more unusual requests than ""tomato paste"" - they likely didn't think twice about it.

Don't let this keep you up tonight. Tomorrow's a new day with new opportunities to order ketchup correctly! üòä","

This happens a lot and is actually why many people don't like to talk about.  I feel like I could be better if I could talk about my anxiety without being told to just relax.",157,LovelyShark,"I totally get this. It's incredibly frustrating and invalidating when people dismiss anxiety as ""just making excuses"" - especially when it took so much courage to open up about it in the first place.

Your description of tensing up and wanting to crawl out of your skin is spot-on. Anxiety is a very real physical and emotional experience, not something we're making up for attention or to get out of things. And yes, sometimes anxiety can make us seem standoffish or rude when we're actually just trying to manage overwhelming feelings.

Something that's helped me is having a few trusted people who actually understand anxiety (whether through personal experience or education about it). Their validation makes it easier to brush off the dismissive comments from others. Also, remember that people's dismissal often comes from their own lack of understanding rather than any fault in you.

You're not alone in this, and your anxiety is valid. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

ou3vxb,Anxiety,He overdosed in front of me.,ScientistSuper7280,"I‚Äôm 24f on my way home from work one day I realized I had forgotten something. I decided to turn around but instead of taking my normal way I decided to take a shortcut that I have never taken before. I was flagged down by a man who said there was a guy ‚Äúsleeping or drunk‚Äù on the side of the road and asked me to see if I could wake him up. (The man that flagged me down couldn‚Äôt speak good English and it was a busy road). I got out of my car and went over to the man. He was ‚Äúsnoring‚Äù but I knew that he wasn‚Äôt drunk he was actually overdosing. I asked how long he had been there and the man said over 30 minutes. I grabbed the phone and called the police. I told them someone was on the side of the road with visible powder up their nose and puke all over them. The operator instructed me to try to wake him up. I found a landscaper and ripped the gloves off of him and proceeded to try and wake the man up. The snoring was getting louder, I was told to start CPR. The guy was stuck behind a tree and I couldn‚Äôt move him I‚Äôm very weak  and he was at least 200 pounds. I tried my best to drag him out. He stopped breathing and I realized he was choking on his own vomit. I pushed him onto his side and he began breathing again. The police showed up and he woke up after some help from them. 

My father is a recovering drug addict and this was one of the worst moments of my life. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I have no medical training, I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt believe no one helped me, people were just watching. They left him there for over 30 minutes. It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Has anyone ever dealt with helping a stranger like this? I can‚Äôt stop replaying the images in my head. I get the worst anxiety about this.

The fact that you were not prepared but stepped up to the challenge anyway makes it that much more incredible. People stand and watch because they don‚Äôt have the guts to get involved. It‚Äôs unfortunately not surprising; the bystander effect is recognized across cultures. Whether out of fear or indifference, few people rise up to the challenge of helping a stranger.

Many people would have driven past or just called 911 and left - you stayed and quite possibly saved that man's life. As someone who also has a parent who struggled with addiction, I know how traumatic this must have been for you.

It's completely normal to feel shaken up after an experience like this. Witnessing an overdose and being the only person taking action is incredibly intense, especially with your personal connection to addiction through your father. The images and anxiety you're experiencing are a natural response to trauma.

Reaching out to a therapist is NOT stupid at all - it's actually really wise. They can help you process this experience and give you tools to manage the anxiety and intrusive thoughts you're having. This is exactly the kind of situation therapy is meant for.

Please be gentle with yourself and proud that you stepped up when others wouldn't. You did everything right in an incredibly difficult situation. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

g14yme,Anxiety,I‚Äôm crying because the pharmacist treated me like a drug addict,knowledgesimm,"(UPDATED!)Today l went to the pharmacist to get my prescription of 7 pieces 0.5 mg xanax that my psychiatrist gave me for my generalized anxiety disorder carrying my passport like they asked of me and because in my country people my age don‚Äôt have any other id (15) and she refused to give it to me saying she needed an id card and people go around asking for this stuff so l told her l don‚Äôt have an ld card and to give me my other prescription of Cipralex and she refused and left the window. It scarred me and l‚Äôm scared to ask for my prescription of xanax in any other pharmacy.

Update: l‚Äôm so happy right now! I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem. This was my first time ever picking xanax and it was so scary but l got thorough it with your kind words and advice! Thank you all so much everyone who upvoted and replied :).",786,163,1586868703,"Im sorry this has happened to you, it sounds like an awful experience to have to endure! That pharmacists reaction seems inappropriate to me. You're not a drug addict. A passport counts as id as well though because it has your birthdate on it, right?? i would either phone your doctor/psychiatrist and explain what happened so they can talk to the pharmacist or go to another pharmacy. the pharmacist you spoke to definitely did not respond to you in a way that they should have, in fact im shocked that they just left the window that seems completely wrong and inappropriate to not even explain why they thought that they couldn't serve you. you had a passport and your prescription so i wouldn't worry about doing anything wrong - you haven't, but i know how these types of experiences can deter you from wanting to do a similar thing again. i do think its worth trying to go to another pharmacist, or even asking (if you are comfortable doing so of course) an older family member to pick it up for you if thats allowed in your country.

if you want to talk to someone to talk your mind of things then my pms are open for anything.",281,azacitidine,"As someone who works in a pharmacy, I'm confused as to how a 7 count script of xanax is a red flag. Passports tend to be a form of valid ID at pretty much every place I've been to as well. Was this a chain or an independent pharmacy? Though to be fair, no matter where it was, that was not how most people would have handled the situation. It really does sound a bit suspect that the interaction went like that. If it was a chain, ask to speak to a manager about your interaction, because that is not customer service. Even if they needed another form of ID, which I don't know why they would since a passport can validate the info needed, they could have been much more polite about it.",41,Sharinganedo,"I'm so glad you got this resolved and had a much better experience with the second pharmacist! It can be really upsetting and scary to be treated with suspicion when you're just trying to get legitimate medication, especially at your age and when dealing with anxiety. The first pharmacist could have handled that situation much more professionally and compassionately.

It's great that you brought your sister with you the second time - having someone to advocate for you can make these situations much less stressful. And now you know which pharmacy chain will accept your passport, so future refills should be smoother.

Don't let that first negative experience discourage you from taking care of your mental health. You're doing the right thing by following your psychiatrist's treatment plan. Just keep your prescription paperwork and passport handy, and remember that you have every right to receive your prescribed medication when you present valid documentation.","

iqahuc,Anxiety,Anyone else have their health issues brushed off by medical professionals due to an anxiety diagnosis?,Optimistic_Mute,"
Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance‚Äôs nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow I‚Äôm seeing that you‚Äôre a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don‚Äôt fly with me as a nurse.‚Äù This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real. After talking more he reluctantly suggested I go to the ED. I didn‚Äôt go immediately that night because the comments made made me feel like I was overreacting and that my need for care wasn‚Äôt important or a waste of time. I did go to the ED that afternoon around 3pm because my rash, itching, and fatigue were only getting worse. I was diagnosed with mites by the ER doctor and prescribed an anti-parasitic which has so far provided some relief. 

I‚Äôve filed a grievance with my insurance because I feel like my dignity as a patient was violated and prevented me from seeking out care. At first I thought maybe this isn‚Äôt a big deal but after consulting with friends they said that this was unacceptable and that I should file a report. I‚Äôm kind of used to going to the doctor and having them brush things off as anxiety and it just seems like a vicious cycle cuz I never do anything about it because of my anxiety and not wanting to make it a big deal.",843,105,1599766465,[deleted],84,[deleted],"I completely understand! In middle school I started passing out every day, and as a result I would get nervous that I would pass out, have a panic attack, and then pass out again. Turns out I have chronic EDS and POTS, which comes with dysautonomia and sensitivities to temperature. Took me 4 years to get an official diagnosis!",30,kr3pie,"I'm so sorry you experienced this - it's sadly a common issue for people with anxiety diagnoses to have their physical symptoms dismissed. You were absolutely right to file a grievance. That nurse's response was unprofessional and potentially dangerous - what if you had a severe allergic reaction that needed immediate treatment?

As someone who's dealt with similar situations, I've learned to be more assertive with medical professionals. Some phrases that help:
""I understand I have anxiety, but these are new/different physical symptoms that need evaluation""
""Please document in my chart that you're declining to examine/treat these symptoms""

Don't let them gaslight you into doubting your own body. Anxiety can cause physical symptoms, yes, but anxious people can also get sick just like anyone else! You deserve proper medical care regardless of your mental health history.

Keep advocating for yourself and don't feel bad about ""making waves"" - your health is worth it. I'm glad you eventually got the correct diagnosis and treatment, even if it took longer than it should have.","

Edit: Reading through all of the comments on this thread, I realized you‚Äôre right.  I called the dentist this morning and rescheduled my appointment to a few weeks from now.  It‚Äôs going to loom over me, but it‚Äôs usually okay once I get there.  I had braces for four years as a teenager and eight teeth removed to make room for the rest to be straight.

As someone who struggled with depression and anxiety for years, basic self-care like brushing teeth was one of the first things to slip. It's amazing how such a simple task can feel so overwhelming some days.

For anyone else struggling: Try keeping a toothbrush and toothpaste by your bed or desk. Sometimes removing that extra step of going to the bathroom makes it easier. And if you can only manage to brush once that day, that's still better than not at all. Progress isn't always perfect.

You're absolutely right about dental procedures being worse than the daily maintenance. Had to learn that lesson the hard way with some expensive root canals. Those few minutes of brushing are worth it to avoid hours in the dentist's chair (especially when anxiety makes dental visits extra challenging).

Keep fighting the good fight everyone. Small victories add up. üí™","

9ecvfp,Anxiety,"Wake up feeling fine until I ""remember"" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?",spaceraycharles,"Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ ",872,75,1536498905,"Yea man, sometimes I'm walking feeling fine and I remember that I have anxiety and unpleasant body sensations from it and boom, I get them lol.",163,nikolaretard,"Yea man, sometimes I'm walking feeling fine and I remember that I have anxiety and unpleasant body sensations from it and boom, I get them lol.",163,nikolaretard,"I totally get this - it's like your brain has developed an anxiety ""habit"" that kicks in the moment you become self-aware each morning. I've experienced something similar where even after the original stressor is gone, that anxious pattern sticks around like an unwanted houseguest.

What's helped me is acknowledging the anxiety without fighting it. When you notice that ""switch"" moment, try saying to yourself ""Oh hey, there's that familiar anxiety pattern"" rather than getting frustrated that it's happening again. This can help break the cycle of getting anxious about being anxious.

Some practical things that might help: Starting your day with a quick meditation or breathing exercise before your brain has a chance to ""remember"" the anxiety. Also, getting some physical movement in early - even just a short walk - can help interrupt that pattern.

Be patient with yourself - your nervous system is probably still cooling down from that stressful situation with your friend. It's totally normal for anxiety patterns to take some time to reset. Just keep gently redirecting your attention when you can, and consider talking to a therapist if it continues to bother you.","

Is your body relaxed right now? Do you shake your leg? Why aren't you still? Unless you're exercising, you should be still and calm. ",862,85,1537277993,Calm and quiet scares me tbh :(,87,Psylocker101,Calm and quiet scares me tbh :(,87,Psylocker101,"This really resonates with me. I used to be that person who would rush through conversations, trying to match everyone else's pace, only to end up tripping over my own words. It's like we're all caught up in this invisible race that nobody actually signed up for.

Something that helped me was treating conversations like I'm telling a bedtime story - there's no rush, and the listener isn't going anywhere. When I catch myself speeding up, I take a conscious breath and reset my pace. It feels weird at first, but people actually tend to pay more attention when you speak more slowly and deliberately.

As for the body awareness - that's huge. I just checked myself after reading your post and realized I was doing the classic anxious leg bounce! It's amazing how our bodies hold onto tension without us realizing it. I've found that setting random ""body check"" reminders on my phone helps me catch these moments and consciously relax.

Remember, moving at your own natural rhythm isn't falling behind - it's being authentic to yourself. Take all the time you need.","

8acm0d,Anxiety,When people say ‚Äútrust your gut feeling‚Äù means something so different to people with anxiety.,ycniuqroach,"Not that I expect everyone to understand, but when people ask what your gut feeling is about something, I literally have to shut it down, because my gut feeling is always anxiety???

But I get it. Our brains see anxiety where other people don't, so it makes a kind of twisted sense that our innermost decision\-makers are living with the same fears and uncertainties as us.",164,sleepyfuzzy,"I totally get this. As someone who also deals with anxiety, I've learned that ""trust your gut"" isn't always great advice for us because our ""gut"" is often just our anxiety speaking. It's like having an overly cautious alarm system that goes off for everything, even when there's no real danger.

What's helped me is learning to distinguish between anxiety-based feelings and actual intuition. I try to ask myself: ""Is this a realistic concern, or is my anxiety amplifying things?"" Sometimes writing down the specific thoughts helps separate legitimate worries from anxiety-driven ones.

Also, it's okay to take time with decisions and not feel pressured to make snap judgments just because others can. Maybe instead of ""trusting your gut,"" try gathering facts, making pros/cons lists, or talking it through with someone you trust who understands your anxiety. This can help ground your decisions in reality rather than anxiety-fueled what-ifs.

You're definitely not alone in this struggle. It's a very real challenge that many of us with anxiety face daily.","

ckkt3b,Anxiety,Does anybody else find themselves clicking the 'discard post' button a lot because they are afraid of being judged?,[deleted],"Edit: Wow, I didn't know that many people had the same issue. Thanks for everyone's feedback!",864,82,1564642335,"I rarely make it to that point at all. As much as I want to ignore it, the whole karma system + general vibes of certain subs makes me anxious to post anything. Most of my interactions are replies to posts or jumping into conversations, just feels easier. I think it has something to do with not being able to gauge your audience, if that makes sense.",105,KevTheObserver,,0,,"I do this all the time! It's like having a constant internal editor who keeps saying ""maybe this isn't good enough"" or ""people might think this is stupid."" I've probably discarded 10x more posts than I've actually submitted.

What helped me was realizing that most people are way too focused on their own stuff to spend time judging our comments, and those who do judge harshly usually aren't the kind of people whose opinions should matter to us anyway. Plus, your perspective might actually help someone else who's thinking the same thing but is afraid to speak up.

I started treating Reddit more like a casual conversation rather than some kind of permanent record. If something I post doesn't land quite right, that's okay - it'll be buried in new posts within hours anyway. The more I post, the easier it gets, and the less that anxiety voice pipes up.

Don't be too hard on yourself - the fact that so many people relate to your post shows you're definitely not alone in this!","

As someone who also started their fitness journey running at night due to self-consciousness, I totally get where you're coming from.

Here's the thing: every single runner out there had a ""day 1"" at some point. And most runners I know are just happy to see others out there pursuing their goals, regardless of speed or size. That realization helped me a lot when I was starting out.

Don't downplay your achievement by calling it a ""small step"" - a week of consistent exercise is huge, especially when pushing through anxiety. You're building both physical and mental strength here.

Keep up that momentum! And if you ever have days where the anxiety creeps back in, remember how you turned that passing runner into motivation instead of letting it derail you. That's the kind of mindset that leads to lasting change.

Please try to keep the momentum going, even if it's just small snacks throughout the day. Your body and mind need the fuel, especially during this challenging time apart.

They even thought they were sick too because of the shotness of breath.",822,122,1599918177,"i already had anxiety, but ive gotten more anxious attacks due to the pandemic.. so id not be surprised if this happened to others.",144,darkywitch,"Definitely. I only really had social anxiety and maybe a few anxiety attacks, but after the pandemic I started having panic attacks, health anxiety and an annoyingly persistent shortness of breath. Still not fully convinced it's not asthma or something else.",2,NoLightOnlyDarkness,"You're definitely not alone in this. The pandemic has caused a huge spike in anxiety and panic attacks, even in people who've never experienced them before. It makes total sense - we're dealing with unprecedented uncertainty, isolation, and constant worry about health and safety.

That shortness of breath symptom is super common with anxiety attacks, and I know it can be especially scary right now since it's also a COVID symptom. The key difference is that anxiety-related breathing issues usually ease up once you calm down, while COVID symptoms persist.

Some things that have helped me and others manage pandemic anxiety:
- Limiting news/social media consumption to specific times
- Maintaining a routine, even a simple one
- Regular video calls with friends/family
- Basic mindfulness exercises or deep breathing
- Getting outside for walks when possible

If the anxiety is significantly impacting your daily life, many therapists are offering online sessions now. There's no shame in getting professional help - these are genuinely challenging times and we all need support.

Hang in there. This won't last forever, even though it sometimes feels like it will.","

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think?

It's like being stuck in a loop where you worry about worrying, then worry about how that worry appears to others. You're definitely not alone in this.

Here's something that helped me: Most people are way too focused on their own lives to analyze your actions the way your anxiety tells you they do. And those who matter will understand - anxiety isn't something you need to constantly explain or apologize for.

Try to be as gentle with yourself as you'd be with a friend. If a friend told you they were overthinking something, would you call them whiny or crazy? Probably not. You'd likely be understanding and supportive.

Don't feel bad about deleting comments or needing to step back sometimes. That's actually a healthy boundary to set when things get overwhelming. You're not narcissistic for having these feelings - you're human, dealing with a real medical condition that millions of others also face.

Sending support your way. Don't feel pressured to delete this post - it's helping others who feel the same way. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

That sense of watching your identity slip away while becoming someone you don't recognize - it's one of the most disorienting experiences anxiety and depression can create.

But here's something I've learned through my own journey: While we can't go back to who we were, we can integrate parts of our past self into who we're becoming. Those things you loved - music, friends, laughter - they're still part of you, just buried under the weight of what you're going through right now.

It's encouraging that you're actively seeking help through therapy and medication. Sometimes things can feel worse before they get better as we process everything. Be patient with yourself. Recovery isn't linear.

Try to reconnect with one small thing you used to enjoy, even if it feels different now. Maybe just listening to music from your band days or texting an old friend. Baby steps.

8r7ozl,Anxiety,Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,ZexMurphy,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again.",835,106,1529031234,"It‚Äôs not too late for you to turn that around for yourself. You have to want it, though.",286,jupiterisagirl,"I understand. The anxiety is so debilitating that it prevents me from emerging from my comfort zone in all aspects in my life. And the years and the opportunities just went by. 

I hope you find a way to break through your cocoon. ",10,hyy65,"Thank you for having the courage to share this. Your message really hits home, especially that part about building walls and avoiding life thinking it would keep you safe. I've struggled with anxiety too, and that false sense of security from avoidance is so tempting.

But you're doing something really important here - using your experience to help others avoid the same path. That takes strength and wisdom. Your story could be exactly what someone needs to hear to make different choices.

It's never too late to start turning things around though. I'm glad to see your edit about not losing hope. You've already shown insight and self-awareness by recognizing how anxiety tricked you - that's actually a huge first step. Have you considered reaching out for professional help? Many therapists now offer sliding scale payments or telehealth options.

You're absolutely right that nobody is alone in this. Anxiety is incredibly common, but it doesn't have to define your future, even if it's influenced your past. Keep holding onto that hope - it's there for a reason.","

POST TITLE: Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.

POST BODY: Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again.

fxyye3,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations?,mkh4990,"I (30M) definitely feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations. When it comes to group conversations, my anxiety levels go though the roof to the point where I can‚Äôt function properly.",857,84,1586460687,It's so much easier to focus on one person. When everyone starts talking I feel like I don't have time to process everything so instead I just tap out.,130,aandr0meda,,0,,"Absolutely relate to this! One-on-one conversations just feel more natural and manageable. When it's just two people, you can really focus on the conversation, read their social cues better, and don't have to worry about ""finding your moment"" to speak up.

Group conversations can be overwhelming because there's so much more to process - multiple people talking, different dynamics at play, and that pressure to contribute without talking over others. It's totally normal to feel anxious in these situations.

What's helped me is starting with smaller groups (3-4 people) of people I'm comfortable with, and gradually working my way up to larger groups. Also, I've found that taking on a ""listener"" role initially helps reduce the pressure - you can ease into the conversation when you feel ready rather than forcing yourself to speak up.

Don't be too hard on yourself about this. Lots of people feel the same way, even if they don't show it. Some of us are just wired to prefer more intimate conversations, and that's perfectly okay!","

As someone who has also struggled with anxiety, I know how overwhelming something like grocery shopping can feel, especially after Covid made everything more complicated. Every step forward, no matter how small it might seem to others, is actually a massive achievement when you're dealing with anxiety.

You should absolutely be proud of yourself. You faced something challenging and proved to yourself that you can do it. Maybe next time it'll feel a little easier knowing you've done it successfully before.

A tip that helped me: I started keeping a ""wins journal"" where I write down moments like this. On harder days, it really helps to look back and remember the times I surprised myself with what I could do.

Keep celebrating these victories - you're doing great! üí™","

Don't be surprised if you feel a mix of excitement and nervousness in these first few weeks - that's totally normal. Everyone around you is figuring things out too, even if they look like they have it all together.

Quick tip from someone who's been there: start building small routines now while things are fresh (like where you like to study, when you review notes, etc.). It'll make everything feel more manageable as the semester gets busier.

Remember that pretty much every student feels overwhelmed at some point - it's part of the college experience. Don't hesitate to reach out to professors during office hours or use campus resources if you need them. They're there for a reason!

Keep that positive attitude going. You've already proven you can handle the first day - you've got this! üí™","

pjfsgz,Anxiety,Anyone else find having a medical appointment completely throws off the whole day?,Dream_1,My anxiety just focusing on that appointment unable to focus on my work or anything else which really bugs me because I need to get things done. My anxiety always gets the better of me :(,863,74,1630988602,[deleted],334,[deleted],,0,,"I totally feel this. Medical appointments have this weird way of becoming this massive mental block that takes over your whole day, even if it's just a routine check-up. It's like your brain goes into ""waiting mode"" and everything else feels impossible to focus on.

Something that's helped me is scheduling appointments first thing in the morning whenever possible. That way, I can get it over with and still have the rest of the day to be productive, rather than having that anxiety cloud hanging over me for hours.

Also, I've started setting specific ""worry windows"" - like giving myself 15 minutes to actively think about/prep for the appointment, then deliberately shifting to other tasks. It doesn't completely eliminate the anxiety, but it helps contain it a bit.

Don't be too hard on yourself though - it's super common to feel this way about medical stuff. Your feelings are totally valid, and sometimes just accepting that today might not be your most productive day can help take some of the pressure off.

Anxiety is like having an overprotective but completely irrational bodyguard in your brain that sees every single thing as a threat. That feeling of not even being able to drink water without your mind turning it into something dangerous? That's brutal, and I'm so sorry you're experiencing that level of anxiety.

Have you been able to talk to a mental health professional? I know it's probably something you've heard before, but proper treatment can make a massive difference. I went from barely functioning to actually managing my anxiety with a combination of therapy and medication. It's not perfect, but it's so much better than where I was.

In the meantime, something that helps me with those intrusive thoughts is to acknowledge them but then gently challenge them: ""I hear you, brain, but we know this water is safe. We've had it hundreds of times before.""

The fact that you pushed yourself outside your comfort zone today is awesome. Each small victory like this helps build confidence for future outings. Maybe next time it won't feel quite as daunting.

Pro tip: If you want to make future trips easier, try going during off-peak hours when stores are less crowded. I find early mornings or late evenings are usually pretty chill. Also, having a detailed shopping list helps me stay focused and makes the whole experience feel more manageable.

What you're describing sounds like an anxiety/stress hangover - when our bodies and minds go through intense anxiety or stress, it can take quite a while to return to baseline. Think of it like running a mental and physical marathon - you wouldn't expect to bounce back the next day.

While ""adrenal fatigue"" isn't a recognized medical diagnosis, the exhaustion and heightened anxiety you're feeling is your nervous system's natural response to being overwhelmed. Your body is essentially trying to recover from being in ""fight or flight"" mode.

Some things that might help during these recovery periods:
- Be extra gentle with yourself and reduce obligations where possible
- Focus on basics: regular meals, consistent sleep schedule, light exercise
- Try calming activities like gentle walks, breathing exercises, or meditation
- Remember this is temporary and will pass

If these episodes are happening frequently, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional who can help you develop strategies to manage anxiety and reduce the intensity of these aftereffects.","

I've experienced something similar where the anxiety just wouldn't ""turn off"" for days. It's absolutely exhausting and scary.

First, please know that although it feels terrible, you're not dying and you will get through this. Persistent anxiety can create a cycle where you become anxious about being anxious, which makes everything feel worse.

Some things that might help:
- Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 method works well)
- Scheduling an appointment with your doctor or a mental health professional
- Getting gentle exercise like walking
- Avoiding caffeine and alcohol
- Trying to maintain regular sleep patterns

Also, don't be afraid to reach out to friends or family. Sometimes just having someone know what you're going through can help reduce the intensity.

I deal with it too, especially during stressful periods. And you're right - it can definitely be connected to both anxiety and certain antidepressants.

A few things that have helped me:
- Getting a night guard from my dentist to protect my teeth
- Setting phone reminders to do ""jaw checks"" throughout the day to catch when I'm clenching
- Massaging my jaw muscles and doing gentle stretches
- Practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing when I notice tension

It might be worth mentioning the clenching to your doctor too, especially since you're on antidepressants. Sometimes adjusting medications can help if that's contributing to it.

Don't beat yourself up about it - it's a really normal physical response to anxiety. Your body is just trying to hold onto tension in whatever way it can.

opsui7,Anxiety,My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions!,chrwiakgjw462q1,"I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace.",854,77,1627007163,That‚Äôs fantastic! Congratulations! I hope others read this and find inspiration from your story!,47,SeekingSanityNow,That‚Äôs fantastic!

As someone who has also gone through CBT, I can really appreciate the amount of work and dedication you put into your healing journey. It's not easy to consistently do the exercises and homework, but you really committed to the process and it paid off.

I love that you highlighted how therapy isn't about being ""cured"" but rather about developing the tools to effectively manage anxiety when it comes up. That's such an important distinction that many people don't understand at first.

The fact that you actively participated, journaled, and pushed yourself to reconnect with people shows incredible strength. You should absolutely be proud of yourself!

POST TITLE: My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions!

POST BODY: I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace.

That is so awesome, especially as they are understanding of anxiety. Have fun at work :D",74,lonelytax,"That's fantastic news! It's so wonderful when you find an employer who actually understands mental health needs and is willing to accommodate them. Having a job that doesn't trigger your anxiety while still providing steady full-time work is honestly such a huge win.

The fact that they're working around your group therapy schedule is especially awesome - that shows they value their employees' wellbeing. Plus, delivery/maintenance work can be great for anxiety since you're often working independently and have clear, straightforward tasks.

One tip from someone who's been there: Make sure to document any accommodation agreements, just to have everything clear and in writing. But it sounds like they're really supportive, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Congratulations again! I hope this job works out great for you. It's really encouraging to hear success stories like this where people find workplaces that understand and support mental health needs. üéâ","

lc2rl3,Anxiety,I just want to be normal,kosmolite,"I see other people who don't struggle with anxiety and everything is so much easier for them. For example: You are shy? Just go and talk to people. Meanwhile I can't event talk straight if I'm anxious. I fear people won't understand me and they surely may try their best, but goddamnit, I just want to not feel anxious all the time about numerous things, I want to live my frickin' life, fulfill what I know I'm capable of. But why does it need to be so hard for me?

Anxiety is a real medical condition that makes everything feel 100x harder - it's like trying to run a race with weights strapped to your legs while everyone else gets to run freely.

I struggled with severe anxiety for years, and that feeling of watching ""normal"" people navigate life effortlessly while you're struggling to breathe is absolutely crushing. But here's what helped me reframe it: Those people aren't necessarily ""stronger"" - they simply don't have the same internal barriers to overcome. Your achievements, even small ones, actually take MORE strength because you're fighting against that anxiety every step of the way.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can provide tools and strategies specifically for anxiety that make things more manageable. It won't make you ""normal"" overnight, but it can help make life feel less overwhelming.

You're not broken or unfit for this world. You're fighting a tough battle that many others don't see or understand. That doesn't make you weak - it makes you incredibly resilient for keeping going despite it all.","

Those emotional releases can be really overwhelming, and it's actually pretty healthy that you found a way to express it, even if just through typing ""fuck"" repeatedly. It's interesting that you mention physical work helped you move past it - that's actually a really solid coping strategy! Physical activity is great for processing intense emotions since it burns off that excess emotional energy and releases endorphins.

Next time you feel that build-up coming, maybe try going for a run, doing some pushups, or even just taking a brisk walk right at the start. It might help you channel those feelings before they peak.

Glad you're feeling better now, even if exhausted. Make sure to hydrate and rest up. We all have those moments - you handled it constructively by working through it rather than letting it spiral.","

In the meantime, there are other ways to get help:
- Many areas have mental health crisis lines you can call
- Some practices offer online GP consultations 
- You can self-refer to mental health services in many places
- Pharmacists can sometimes provide initial guidance

I know your trust has been damaged, but please don't give up. That first call proved you have the strength to ask for help - you just need to find the right person to give it. Would you like help finding resources in your area?","

Something that's helped me cope is creating a gentle Sunday evening routine that I actually look forward to. I do some light prep for Monday (picking out clothes, quick lunch prep) to feel more in control, then deliberately switch to ""me time"" - maybe a favorite show, a relaxing bath, or some reading. Basically treating Sunday evening as its own special time rather than just seeing it as pre-Monday anxiety hours.

Also, try to remind yourself that you've successfully handled hundreds of Mondays before. The anxiety you're feeling now isn't actually making tomorrow any easier - it's just stealing your peace today.

If the sleep issues are really rough, maybe consider moving some of your Monday morning prep to Sunday afternoon? That way your evening can be more relaxed instead of filled with tomorrow's stress.

First, myself",893,34,1604982549," The Worst Part Of Anxiety Is Feeling Unloved, Unimportant, And Unappreciated",139,Raosaab47,,0,,"I hear you, and this is such a powerful realization you've come to. That last line - ""First, myself"" - shows you're already on the right path.

It's completely natural to want love, understanding, and care from others. We're social beings, after all. But you've hit on something really important: self-love has to be the foundation. When we learn to truly listen to ourselves and show ourselves compassion, it changes how we interact with the world around us.

Start small. Maybe it's taking a few minutes each day to check in with yourself, writing down your thoughts, or doing one thing daily that makes you feel cared for. It's not selfish - it's necessary. Think of it like putting on your own oxygen mask first on a plane.

You absolutely deserve love - both from yourself and others. And you're right, it starts with you. Keep nurturing that relationship with yourself. The rest will follow.

Sending you strength on this journey. You've already taken the first step by recognizing this truth.","

kgkjs8,Anxiety,Does anybody have a high amount of social anxiety but no fear of public speaking or making presentation?,discocrisco,"For me, I have a huge amount of social anxiety but I have zero anxiety with making presentations or public speaking.  

Being in business meeting is easy for me.  Or speaking at AA meeting.  It is almost second nature.

I wonder if anybody else has the same issue and specifically, struggle with one on one communication.  Dating is near impossible for me.",815,112,1608426824,"I used to be in theatre. I‚Äôve literally performed in front of hundreds of people with little to no issue, I would be able to look directly into the audience, I could sing despite being self conscious of my voice...

But going to a social gathering? I want to throw up. Any situation that involves possible one-on-one conversation makes me want to throw up, shake, and I end up either talking about any random thing or I don‚Äôt talk at all. I have to know everything about the situation in order to alleviate the anxiety just a little bit. 

I think the difference is maybe just knowing what to expect and having a general outline of what you need to be talking about. At AA, you talk about AA stuff. At a business meeting, you talk about business stuff. Going on a date... what do you talk about? The food? The weather? What questions will be brought up? What questions should I ask? There‚Äôs a million possibilities, but presentations only have a few outcomes.",169,individual-person,,0,,"I totally get this! I've noticed the same pattern in myself and others - being able to give presentations confidently while struggling with casual social interactions. It actually makes sense when you think about it: public speaking is structured and you're essentially performing a role, while one-on-one interactions require more spontaneity and personal vulnerability.

With presentations, you can prepare, you know your material, and there's a clear purpose and format. But casual conversations and dating? That's unpredictable territory where you have to be more authentically ""you,"" which can feel way more exposing for those of us with social anxiety.

Have you considered using some of those public speaking strengths in your personal interactions? Like how you probably prepare for presentations, you could have a few go-to topics or questions ready for social situations. Start viewing one-on-one conversations more like mini-presentations - you're just sharing your story and listening to theirs.

You're definitely not alone in this. It's a pretty common experience for people with social anxiety to feel more comfortable in structured social situations than casual ones.","

In the meantime, something that helped me was setting really small, achievable goals each day - like just taking a 5-minute walk or doing one small task. It helps fight both the depression inertia and gives your anxious mind something concrete to focus on.

Also, while caffeine and sugar might give you temporary energy, they can actually make anxiety worse in the long run. Maybe try gradually cutting back and replacing them with more stabilizing alternatives?

I do the exact same thing with Parks & Rec and The Good Place. There's actually some psychology behind why we find comfort in rewatching familiar shows - it's called ""repeat consumption"" and it can help reduce anxiety because you know exactly what's going to happen. No surprises means your brain can relax.

Think about it like comfort food - these shows are predictable, the characters feel like old friends, and you don't have to invest mental energy into following a new plot. When you're anxious, your brain is already working overtime, so having something familiar and lighthearted can be really soothing.

While it's a perfectly fine coping mechanism, just make sure it's not your only tool for managing anxiety. Maybe try mixing in some other stress-relief techniques like short walks or breathing exercises. But don't feel guilty about your B99 marathons - sometimes Jake Peralta and the gang are exactly what we need!

I've noticed the same thing with my anxiety. The mask can feel like a little security blanket - it hides facial expressions we might be self-conscious about and creates a subtle barrier between us and the world that feels protective.

I've heard quite a few people mention this same experience, especially those with social anxiety. It's like the mask gives us a bit of emotional distance and privacy, even in public spaces. For some, it reduces the pressure to maintain certain facial expressions or worry about how others perceive us.

Just be mindful that while masks can feel comforting, it's good to also work on developing other anxiety management tools (therapy, breathing exercises, etc.) since we can't always rely on masks in every situation. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with appreciating this unexpected benefit of mask-wearing in your workplace!

I'm glad you've found something that helps make your workday more manageable. Healthcare work is stressful enough without anxiety adding to it! üíú","

What you're describing sounds a lot like anxiety and specifically death anxiety, which can be really overwhelming. That feeling of manually controlling your breathing and being hyper-aware of it is also a classic anxiety symptom.

I've dealt with similar thoughts, and they can definitely create this awful spiral where the more you try not to think about it, the more it consumes you. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They have specific techniques for dealing with intrusive thoughts and death anxiety that can be really helpful.

In the meantime, something that might help with the breathing issue is to try grounding exercises - like the 5-4-3-2-1 method (name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, etc.). It helps get you out of your head and back into the present moment.

You're not alone in this, and you're not weird for feeling this way. It's a natural human fear that sometimes gets amplified by anxiety. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if it's affecting your daily life. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

lbjexo,Anxiety,does anyone else get more frightened by the thought of a responsibility rather than the responsibility itself?,horror_haller,"for example, (some of!!) my responsibilities tend to be easier than i think, but the idea of doing them terrifies me.

 i think i get terrified because everytime something good happens to me something bad needs to happen to balance it, it's like some unwritten rule in the universe that applies specifically for me. 

also, unrealted, but i have to ask this; which one bothers you more, physical anxiety or mental anxiety?

EDIT: thanks for all the support y'all. have an amazing, anxiety free day!",881,42,1612342305,"I feel the exact same as you do.

I can‚Äôt say which is worse. Physical definitely feels worse because you can‚Äôt control the way your body is feeling / reacting to your anxiety, it‚Äôs simply there and you cant get  rid of the feeling. (flight/fight) Mental is always there... a voice constantly telling you you‚Äôre not good enough or can‚Äôt do it.

The anticipation anxiety is often way worse than actually doing the thing itself. Our minds tend to catastrophize and build up these scenarios that rarely match reality.

That feeling that good things must be ""balanced"" by bad things - I've been there too. But try to remember that's just our anxiety creating false patterns. Good things can happen without a cosmic debt needing to be paid. You deserve good things!

To answer your question about physical vs mental anxiety - personally, I find mental anxiety harder to deal with because it's this constant background noise of worry that's harder to pinpoint and address. At least with physical symptoms, I can usually identify what's happening and use specific coping techniques.

One thing that helps me with responsibility-related anxiety is breaking things down into tiny steps and just focusing on the next small action. It makes things feel more manageable and less overwhelming.

Keep being brave and tackling those responsibilities - you're doing better than you think! üí™","

I also had anxiety since childhood but just powered through it because I thought that's what everyone did. It wasn't until 32 that I really started taking it seriously and doing the actual work beyond just taking meds.

You made a really good point about how life's demands can mask these issues. When you're constantly in ""survival mode"" with school, work, and responsibilities, it's easy to push mental health to the back burner. Plus, as kids/teens, we often don't have the tools or awareness to recognize anxiety as something that can be addressed.

Exercise and self-care are fantastic starting points! I found that combining those with mindfulness practices really helped me understand my anxiety triggers better. One thing that helped me was keeping a simple anxiety journal - just noting when anxiety spikes and what was happening at the time. It helped me spot patterns I never noticed before.

You're already doing the hardest part - acknowledging it and taking action. Be patient with yourself as you figure out what works best for you. It's never too late to start this journey.","

I love how you've made this an open, judgment-free zone where people can just be themselves. Sometimes taking care of ourselves means stepping away, taking breaks, or celebrating differently than what society expects. And that's completely okay.

m9imxi,Anxiety,Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism?,[deleted],"Like, to a crippling level. I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao",863,60,1616281794,"I struggle hard with negative feedback - I can get 95% glowing feedback and 5% negative and the couple negative ones completely overpower the good until it's all I can think about...for months, literally. It sucks all the joy and the fun out of it for me and makes me physically sick simply at the *thought* of picking up a pen. Logically, of course I know that the people who love it far outnumber those who don't, that I shouldn't care about those who don't, etc, but mental illness doesn't respond to logic.",115,larki18,,0,,"This is incredibly common, especially among creative people! What you're describing sounds a lot like rejection sensitive dysphoria - where even constructive criticism feels like a punch to the gut. I struggled with this exact same thing when I started writing.

Something that helped me was starting really small - maybe share your work with just one trusted friend who understands your anxiety. Let them know you're working on receiving feedback and ask them to be gentle but honest. You can even set parameters like ""just tell me one thing you liked and one small suggestion.""

Also, try reframing criticism as proof that you're brave enough to put yourself out there. Every piece of feedback, even if it stings, means you're taking steps to grow. That's something to be proud of!

And yes, therapy can be super helpful for this! A good therapist can give you tools to manage the anxiety and build confidence. There's no shame in getting support - lots of writers work with therapists to deal with these exact feelings.

You're not alone in this at all. Keep writing, be patient with yourself, and take baby steps with feedback. You've got this!","

DO YOU GET A OVERWHELMING SENSATION ALL OVER YOUR BODY AND FEEL REALLY SCARED???,3,JackW357,"I totally get this - nighttime anxiety is like your brain's favorite time to play the ""what if"" game, right? It's incredibly common to have anxiety spike at night when everything gets quiet and there are fewer distractions from our thoughts.

Have you tried creating a ""wind-down"" routine that starts an hour before bed? Something like:
- Dimming lights
- Writing down your worries in a journal (gets them out of your head)
- Some light stretching or breathing exercises
- Listening to sleep stories or meditation apps

Also, when those health anxiety thoughts pop up, try reminding yourself: ""This is just my anxiety talking. I was fine all day, and I'll be fine in the morning."" It sounds simple, but acknowledging these thoughts as anxiety symptoms rather than real threats can help break that spiral.

If this is seriously affecting your sleep regularly, it might be worth chatting with a doctor or therapist. They can give you more specific strategies for managing nighttime anxiety.

You're not alone in this - night anxiety is a real struggle for many people. Sending you peaceful vibes for better nights ahead! üåô","

Sorry for that rant. If anyone would like to talk about it, I'd be happy to possibly make some new friends!",829,92,1551813064,"Yes, there's a reason you're anxious. You have generalized anxiety disorder. 

*Gentle hugs*",273,TheDrachen42,"Sorry you are going through this. Please know that their judgment is a mirror of how they deal with their own emotions. A lot of times they do not give themselves permission to feel a certain way if they do not find a reason for it. But sometimes there is no immediate reason. 

Usually a lot of men can be quite technical, where they want to pinpoint the reason for anxiety and solve it.

In the end, you could explain anxiety, or any other disorder, by looking at genetical predisposition and environmental factors such as childhood experiences or drug use. But that doesn't help you.

I think what's best to say in these situations is ""you're making me feel worse"". Confront them with how black and white they see the anxiety and hand them a mirror for their own behavior. ",3,joogroo,"I totally get this. Having GAD myself, it's so frustrating when people try to rationalize anxiety or suggest there must be a ""reason."" Sometimes your body just decides today's the day for anxiety! It's like asking someone why they have asthma or diabetes - these are real medical conditions that don't need a specific trigger to flare up.

And the binge eating urges - people really don't understand how it's not as simple as ""just eat something."" It's like telling someone with OCD to ""just stop thinking about it."" The compulsion and lack of control are the whole issue.

Please know your feelings are valid, even when you can't point to a specific cause. You're dealing with real mental health conditions that deserve to be taken seriously. Have you considered finding a support group for people with similar experiences? Sometimes it helps just to be around others who truly understand what you're going through without trying to ""fix"" it.

gqmycs,Anxiety,Does anyone else have intense fear that they‚Äôll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,hocrm,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill ‚Äújinx‚Äù it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she‚Äôs independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way &lt;3 )*",846,74,1590453859,"If you end up being 27 and living with your parents then so be it. I'm 26 and live with my parents still. Have battled unemployment, depression, anxiety, and other shit but my parents still support me. You should look at it this way, enjoy having that support and family around as much as you can, because it won't always be like that. I was the same way when I was your age, all I can suggest is to push yourself but don't rush it. I didn't get my license until I was 21. It's hard to imagine yourself doing those things you said but you can do it, and I'm sure you will do most if not all of the things you mentioned.",103,JulianGiraffe,,0,,"I really feel for you - what you're experiencing is actually a pretty normal reaction to facing independence, just perhaps more intensely than most. The fear of losing family and being ""thrown into the deep end"" of adulthood is something many of us have dealt with.

Here's what helped me: Start taking baby steps toward independence while you still have your support system. Maybe begin with small things like making your own doctor's appointments or paying for groceries. Each tiny victory builds confidence. You don't have to tackle everything at once.

Also, remember that being independent doesn't mean being alone. Healthy adults still lean on family and friends - we just learn to stand on our own feet while maintaining those connections. Your family clearly loves you and wants to help, so maybe talk to them about gradually teaching you life skills rather than doing things for you.

Consider talking to a therapist too - they can help you develop tools to manage your anxiety about all this. Growing up is scary, but you don't have to figure it out all at once. Take it one small step at a time.","

I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way &lt;3 )*

Please don't beat yourself up about having this reaction. Anxiety isn't always logical, and feeling overwhelmed by unexpected attention is actually really common - even for people who don't usually struggle with anxiety. The fact that you pushed through your comfort zone to share something meaningful about your grandparents is actually pretty brave.

Maybe next time you could try posting with the mindset that you'll let yourself step away from the notifications for a while if it gets overwhelming. There's nothing wrong with sharing something and then taking care of yourself by creating some distance when you need to.

I'm glad you felt safe enough to vent here. Anxiety can feel really isolating sometimes, but you're definitely not alone in experiencing this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

d8gc1f,Anxiety,One of my favorite phrases my therapist told me to keep in mind when I start to feel anxious...,Kaygarthedestroyer,"He said, ‚Äúyou want to notice your thoughts as they float down the river of your mind, without getting swept away by them.‚Äù

Just ‚Äúnoticing‚Äù my anxious thoughts, not entertaining them nor judging or analyzing them helps me to de-escalate my worries before they turn into a full blown panic attack. 

I hope this helps in some way.",864,55,1569288922,"This sounds like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

Another good metaphor that I like is imagining yourself on a bridge looking below at 3 different trains on 3 tracks. One train carries carts full of your thoughts, one carries your physical responses to those thoughts , and the last carries your urges to act( e. g escape the situation). The idea is to try stay on the bridge without getting involved with anything on the tracks. Just watch the trains pass and just notice. It really helps to desensitize you.",140,UrbanUnicornz,[deleted],62,[deleted],"This is such a powerful metaphor - I love how it captures the essence of mindfulness without getting too technical. I've struggled with anxiety too, and learning to be an ""observer"" of my thoughts rather than getting tangled up in them was a game-changer.

Your therapist's river analogy reminds me of something I learned in meditation - thoughts will always come and go, just like water flowing downstream. We don't have to grab onto every thought that passes by. Sometimes just acknowledging ""oh, that's an anxious thought"" and letting it drift away is enough to break the spiral before it starts.

Thanks for sharing this. It's a really helpful visualization tool that I think a lot of people here could benefit from. Sometimes the simplest metaphors are the most effective for managing anxiety in the moment.","

icv4t1,Anxiety,Just went to the dentist for the first time in ten years,SexyAbeLincoln,"And it was fine! No cavities, good x-rays. 

When I got out of college I was broke and didn't have insurance, so I stopped going to the dentist. After a while I finally got a decent job and dental insurance, but my anxiety had become worse and my shame/avoidance behaviors kicked in. The more time that passed, the more shame I felt about not having been to the dentist. So I just didn't go. 

I don't know what changed recently, but the other day I just looked up a place with good reviews and made an appointment before I could think about it too much. I told them it had been a few years so I didn't have any x-rays to send over. Nobody made a big deal about it. The dental hygenist and the dentist were both very kind. Also, apparently these days they let you watch Netflix while your teeth are being cleaned?? Back in my day your only entertainment was the sound of metal scraping against tooth enamel. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. None of my friends know about this because I'm too embarrassed to admit to it, but I'm very proud of myself. And to anyone else struggling with avoidance, *you're not alone.* Please try and prioritize your health and ask for help if you need it.

Recently I‚Äôve been thinking that I need to do this, and reading this is inspiring.",76,InTheFlesk,"This is so relatable and I'm really glad you shared this! The shame spiral around avoiding medical/dental care is so real - the longer you wait, the more anxiety builds up about going, which makes you wait longer... it's a tough cycle to break.

Huge props to you for just booking that appointment and going through with it. That takes real courage. And what a relief that everything turned out fine! The Netflix thing is pretty great, right? Dental offices have gotten so much better at making the experience less stressful.

Your last paragraph is spot on - the anticipation and fear is almost always worse than the actual experience. I hope your post encourages others who might be in the same boat to take that first step. Sometimes just hearing someone else's success story can help break down those mental barriers.

Congrats again on taking care of yourself! Don't feel embarrassed - you faced your anxiety and that's something to be proud of.","

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I‚Äôm already taking. I don‚Äôt want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that‚Äôs being sold on the street to get high. I‚Äôve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don‚Äôt* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So‚Ä¶ weed. Sure, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmore harmless‚Äù than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance ‚Äî like medication, alcohol, food ‚Äî can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It‚Äôs always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don‚Äôt want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù. Hell, I don‚Äôt want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me. 

Like I‚Äôve said above, I know people generally mean well. But it starts getting annoying when they keep pushing for me to take weed, like it‚Äôs a panacea for my illnesses. I want to tell them: I‚Äôm glad it helps you, I am, but just because it works for you doesn‚Äôt mean it will work for me. If we exchange routines ‚Äî you take my meds and I take weed ‚Äî I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd say an entirely different story.

It's exhausting when people try to push their ""miracle solution"" on you, even if they mean well. You know your body, your struggles, and what works for you better than anyone else.

The fact that you're so self-aware about your addictive tendencies and carefully managing your current medication shows really good judgment. You're absolutely right that weed isn't some magical cure-all, and it can definitely become its own dependency issue.

I've seen friends go through similar situations where well-meaning people keep pushing certain solutions, whether it's weed, CBD, or whatever the latest trend is. It's okay to firmly tell people ""I appreciate the suggestion, but I've made an informed decision about my treatment plan with my doctor, and I'm not looking to change it.""

Keep trusting your instincts and doing what works for you. Mental health treatment isn't one-size-fits-all, and you don't owe anyone an explanation for your choices.","

Please don't beat yourself up about not doing it sooner. Everyone's journey is different, and you did it exactly when you were ready to do it. That's what matters. The past is the past - you're taking care of yourself NOW, and that's amazing.

Just remember that the first counselor you see might not be the perfect fit, and that's okay too. It's like any relationship - sometimes you need to try a few times to find the right match. You've already done the hardest part by making the appointment.

A tip that helps me: I keep a little note on my phone of ""wins"" like this. On tough days when anxiety is telling me I can't do something, I look back at that list as proof that I've overcome similar challenges before.

b137g2,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? Read more inside.,saltyman420,"What‚Äôs up y‚Äôall, hope you are all doing well.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I‚Äôd always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I‚Äôm gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I‚Äôm doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what‚Äôs plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It‚Äôs kinda because it‚Äôs a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I‚Äôm like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks.",814,102,1552584798,"One of my hobbies is I'm a musician... A lot of the time my mind is focused on the fact that I'm not good enough and what other people think of the stuff I make (Especially when I cross reference stuff)... It not only makes me less creative but makes me demoralized and just want to quit all together so I don't work on stuff... as a result I don't improve and that feeds back into the problem. Its not just music either... but my university work too. 

In summary I feel this all the damn time and I hate it so much...",88,-Arrez-,"Honestly, I feel like this just comes with being an adult. Your job, bills, relationships, family issues... these things take a lot mental energy and leave me with little else. ",1,Annethraxxx,"I feel this so deeply. It's like anxiety creates this fog that makes it impossible to access that childlike wonder and creativity we used to have. Instead of dreaming up new worlds, we're stuck in these exhausting thought loops about past mistakes and future worries.

But here's what's helped me start getting some of that spark back: I deliberately schedule small pockets of ""play time"" where the only rule is there are no rules. Could be 15 minutes of doodling, writing a silly story, or just letting my mind wander without judgment. At first it feels forced, but it slowly helps break that anxiety cycle.

The creative mind isn't gone - it's just buried under layers of adult stress and overthinking. It's like a muscle that needs gentle exercise to get strong again. Start small, be patient with yourself, and maybe try to reconnect with some of those old interests that used to light you up.

You're definitely not alone in this. Anxiety is really good at making us forget how to play and dream, but that capacity for wonder is still in there somewhere.","

Maybe we could try pretending we're giving advice to a friend when we're dealing with our own anxiety? Like literally imagine you're writing a supportive Reddit comment to yourself. It sounds a bit silly, but it can help create that mental distance that makes us so good at helping others.

Also, the fact that helping others calms you down is actually really beautiful. It shows you have natural empathy and emotional intelligence. Perhaps focusing on supporting others (while still taking care of yourself) could be part of your own anxiety management toolkit.

Just remember - you deserve the same compassion and understanding that you so readily give to others. Your advice is probably spot-on, you just need to work on believing it applies to you too! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Am I just being a bitch? I can't bring myself to just message them, even though I want to.

Anyone got advice?",870,46,1622205813,"I struggled with this for a while too, until my therapist gave me a technique that completely relieved these thoughts for me.

Here's what she told me:

First, pick three or four characteristics that you would want people to describe you as. I chose supportive, kind, intelligent, and calm. Take your time and really reflect on what your ideal self would be like. Once you choose your words, think of these as your *objectives.* 

When you are socializing, all that is in your power is being the most \*your characteristics\* as you can. In your case, (I'll use my words for this example), you are afraid of reaching out to people, but if your message is kind, supportive, calm, and intelligent, then what more can you do? If you are being the best you can be, there is no reason to live up to other people's expectations of you. If they are actually bothered by you, then it is their issue, not yours. 

I personally struggled with replaying scenes of socializing with people in my head afterward, so I would use this to sort of grade myself - I would ask, ""was I as supportive as I could have been? How so?"" and then go through all of my characteristics.

I recommend putting little sticky notes around your house, or put a note on your phone to remind you of this. It took a little bit for me to actually accept that this is all that I can do, but now, I never worry about what other people think of me because I am simply trying to be the best version of myself, and if someone doesn't like that, then that is their burden, not mine, and it shouldn't be yours either.

I hope this helps :) and please ask for clarification if I didn't explain clearly enough!",193,hankhan18,"I feel like this to, it‚Äôs not true though. It‚Äôs just our brains playing tricks on us. The people in our lives love us more then we think",11,sasha_Black03,"I totally get this feeling - that constant worry about being a burden or annoying others is really tough to deal with. You're definitely not being a ""bitch"" - this is a really common form of social anxiety that a lot of people struggle with.

Here's something that helped me: most people actually love getting messages from old friends. Think about how you feel when an old friend reaches out - it usually feels pretty good, right? They're probably feeling the same way about hearing from you.

Start small. Maybe send a simple ""Hey, saw this and thought of you!"" with a meme or article they'd like. Or just a ""Hope you're doing well!"" Most people understand that life gets busy and connections fade sometimes - it doesn't mean you don't care.

And remember - if someone doesn't respond well, that's on them, not you. You're making an effort to maintain friendships, and that's something to be proud of, not ashamed of.

Take that first step. The anxiety might still be there, but pushing through it gets easier with practice.","

I wanted to change it to CNN but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. So i changed it to local news. So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself.",850,66,1554907846,"Your next step would be to politely ask if they mind watching the news instead. I know that‚Äôs a huge feat when you have anxiety, but you are not a burden, and they may even feel appreciated that you value their opinion. Or another solution could be headphones and streaming something if that‚Äôs available for you. But I suppose that could also be counter productive if you‚Äôre trying to challenge your anxiety by staying connected with your outside world and not staying in a technological bubble. Either way, I AM PROUD OF YOU! :)",148,PoblanoMyOmelette,"I never have watched the 700 club and I rarely partake in watching TV evangelism,  but I will say a few things about this. 

First, I am shocked this post was upvoted so many times. And I truly believe it wasn‚Äôt upvoted because of the victory you had, but because you made a very stressed point about not wanting to hear anything about Jesus. 

It deeply... deeply saddens me, grieves me to see such repulsiveness to the lord on your part. Where you are willing or have the thought of leaving to your car to get away from him. Before you stop reading, and yes I am speaking directly to the original poster, please hear me out. 

What exactly did God do to you to cause you to be so repulsed by him? Don‚Äôt blame it on the hosts. Because I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what this is all about. 

God, Jesus Christ, didn‚Äôt do anything to you to cause you harm. He didn‚Äôt cause any of this world to act the way it does. Mankind, in all his ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù fights tooth and nail against God because he thinks he knows better. And satan and his army of demons, work in the invisible world and heavenly places to seek out and destroy us. It is satan, not God who causes strife. 

If anything, you should be repulsed by CNN or any other news network for that matter, especially modern pop culture. It‚Äôs filled with the work of satan. 

Let me stress this again, God did not do anything to you to cause YOU to hate him. You hate him because you‚Äôve been deceived. 

God has done EVERYTHING he could to save us from our sin. When he said, ‚Äúit is finished,‚Äù on the cross, he meant it. Anyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved, our salvation is sealed in him. 

The fact is, in your current mindset and where your heart is, you are going to hell. Many are on that path. Many! The Bible says so. 

God loves us so much. You have NO IDEA how much he loves us. If you think for a second how hard this worldly life is, imagine how bad hell will be. With no second chances. And eternal separation from Jesus Christ, his love and his glory. 

Yes, I‚Äôm approaching this the classical hated way by so many who disbelieve by bringing hell into the equation. And I am standing my ground in this. Because that‚Äôs the final verdict for all who deny the one and ONLY living God. 

My intention is not to fear you into allowing the lord into your heart. My intention is to show you what‚Äôs on the line. God, is beyond good. He offers love like you‚Äôve never experienced. Your family, husband, kids or no one else can even come close to the love Christ offers. He is a gracious, loving, merciful and forgiving God. He‚Äôs coming back soon. 

I would hate to see you continue to hold on to so much hate for him and be eternally separated in complete agony. Christ said there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth there. Is it really worth leaning on your own understanding for these things? Your own understanding will get you no where. 

I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice all of my karma to stress to you how wrong you are right now. And it‚Äôs out of love. 

Over 700 people upvoted this post and it goes to show just how far separated we are from Christ. It deeply saddens me. We all have our own choices to make. And mine right now is to scream at you as loud as I can and say go the other way. You won‚Äôt be let down. 

What hope is there for any of us to live a part from God? Honestly ask yourself this question. What really matters in your life a part from God? My belief is a part from God, nothing.... absolutely nothing matters in this life.  If God is not the head of our life, we are dust in the wind. 

I pray you come to Christ someday. You won‚Äôt be popular, people will hate you, you won‚Äôt be upvoted, you‚Äôll be down voted because you speak in his name. But that‚Äôs ok. Jesus said the world hated him first and so we‚Äôll be hated as well as a result.

Wake up people! Jesus is coming back soon. Don‚Äôt be deceived! The day of the lord is at hand! And I can‚Äôt wait for it. But in the meantime, I desperately want to see people on Christ‚Äôs side. Not their own  misdirected side. 

Out of love to all! 

Amen brothers and sisters.",-6,Makingchanges33,"Good for you for speaking up! It's completely reasonable to be uncomfortable with religious programming in a medical waiting room, especially content that makes claims about healing disabilities. Medical facilities should aim to be welcoming and inclusive spaces for everyone.

Changing it to local news was actually a really diplomatic choice - you found a neutral alternative that's still informative. Don't feel bad about wanting to avoid potential conflict with the other patients. Small steps like this take courage, and you handled it thoughtfully.

For what it's worth, most medical offices appreciate feedback about their waiting room environment. If you're comfortable, you could mention to the staff that having neutral programming would be more appropriate for their diverse patient base. They might not have even realized what was playing.

Be proud of yourself for advocating for a more comfortable environment, even if it felt a bit awkward in the moment. These small acts of speaking up do make a difference!","

niopdf,Anxiety,Do you ever worry if you stop worrying that something will happen?,ayanaloveswario,"I‚Äôm not sure if I can even put this into words that make sense. But in the past few months a lot of things have hit me all at once. I got COVID, switched to two different birth controls...both have significantly worsened my anxiety. I used to have specific things that worried me but now it‚Äôs like it could be anything. I find myself always thinking about the worse case scenario and about anything bad that could possibly happen.

Like if you let your guard down, that's when everything will fall apart. I've been there.

What you're describing is actually a really common anxiety pattern, especially after going through multiple stressful events (COVID + hormone changes from BC can be huge anxiety triggers). Your brain is trying to protect you by staying ""on alert,"" but it's stuck in overdrive.

Here's something that helped me: Worrying doesn't actually prevent bad things from happening - it just steals peace from the present moment. The bad things that happened in your past weren't because you ""weren't worrying enough."" They just happened, as things sometimes do.

Maybe start small - try letting go of worry for just 5 minutes at a time. Notice that the world doesn't fall apart. Gradually build up that trust. And if you can, consider talking to a therapist - they can give you some great tools for managing these thought patterns.

Be gentle with yourself. This is a really tough headspace to be in. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Also there's the whole ""don't let them win"" thing. Don't let domestic terrorism events make you scared to live your life because that's often the goal of the perpetrators- to instill terror.

Also, knowing your emergency exits and having an exit plan is important in any group event. That's true for any type of emergency. Could help make you feel a little better.",260,Szikk,"I hate that we all have to feel this way. like let's go to the beach and relax, oh wait let me pack my Kevlar flak jacket and helmet and riot shield.

Mass shootings are terrifying, and it's completely normal to feel anxious about public spaces. But I'm so glad you ended up going and had an awesome time! That's exactly what I would have encouraged - not letting fear stop you from living your life.

The reality is that while these events are horrific, they're still statistically very rare. Living in constant fear gives these tragic events more power over our daily lives than they deserve. It's okay to be aware and cautious, but try not to let anxiety rob you of beautiful experiences like the one you just had!

If you find these thoughts becoming overwhelming regularly, talking to a therapist can really help provide tools to manage anxiety about public spaces. They can help you find a healthy balance between staying aware and still enjoying life.

I get nonverbal when overwhelmed/overstimulated as well",110,llama1122,"I totally understand what you're going through. Going non-verbal during sensory overload and stressful situations is actually pretty common, especially when you're trapped in an environment with no escape route. It's like your brain just hits the mute button as a defense mechanism.

Since you're stuck on the couch without much privacy, maybe try these coping strategies:
- Noise-canceling headphones or earplugs if you have them
- Step outside for brief ""phone calls"" when you need air
- Use your phone to text family members instead of speaking when you're feeling non-verbal
- Find a quiet bathroom for short breaks if possible
- Download a white noise app to help drown out the chaos

Don't feel guilty about going non-verbal - it's your body's way of protecting itself when things get overwhelming. If you feel comfortable, you could let one understanding family member know that you sometimes need quiet time to recharge, so they can help run interference with others.

Hang in there. Holiday visits are temporary, and you'll be back in your own space soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

The fact that you feel guilty about ""inconveniencing"" others and want to be independent actually shows the opposite of attention-seeking.

Please don't let one bad therapist make you doubt yourself. It's completely reasonable to be upset by what she said. A good therapist should create a safe, non-judgmental space to work through these challenges, not dismiss or shame you for them.

I'm glad you're seeing a psychiatrist soon. In the meantime, know that having anxiety doesn't make you ""crazy"" or ""useless."" It's an incredibly common condition that can be managed with the right support and treatment. Many people struggle with driving anxiety and phone anxiety - you're not alone in this.

That crushing anxiety you're feeling? It's often a stress response to big positive changes, even though that seems counterintuitive. Your brain is basically freaking out because you've pushed yourself out of your comfort zone, even though it was in good ways.

Please know that you have every right to refuse to work while sick - not just for your own health, but for the safety of others. If your superiors are pressuring you, consider reporting this to your state's healthcare worker protection board or union if you have one. Your health matters too.

Have you considered looking for healthcare positions in other states or settings that might have better working conditions? Or even taking a brief break from direct patient care to protect your mental health? There's no shame in stepping back when a situation becomes unsustainable.

Apparently I also have an RBF, so people at my old school have told me that I was intimidating or they thought I was angry or something. At my new school, they're not as fazed, but it still makes it exceptionally hard to make friends. I try to make a point of piping up a bit before going back to quiet, so that I come off as polite but shy.

I ended up liking these two people where the silence wasn't awkward or pressuring but comfortable.",23,seekingpetrichor,"I totally get this - I'm the same way and have had people tell me they thought I was stuck-up when they first met me. The reality was that I was just anxious and overthinking every potential interaction!

Something that helped me was realizing that being quiet doesn't make you rude - it's totally normal to be reserved, especially in new social situations. What I started doing was making small gestures to show I'm friendly even when I'm not talking much - like smiling, nodding along in conversations, or just saying a quick ""hey"" when passing people. These little acknowledgments go a long way in showing others you're not dismissing them.

Also, if you feel comfortable, it can help to be upfront about it. I've told people ""Sorry if I seem quiet, I can be a bit shy at first!"" Most people are actually really understanding when you explain it that way.

Don't be too hard on yourself. There are lots of us ""quiet types"" out there, and there's nothing wrong with taking time to warm up to people.","

fzyk4u,Anxiety,Anyone else hate their birthday?,uncoolforever,"Today is my birthday. I‚Äôm not looking for attention I just need to vent. Every single year I dread my birthday. It‚Äôs like I wake up the day of with the false sense of expectation about ‚Äúmy special day‚Äù and then am terribly let down that it wasn‚Äôt made special. Does that make sense? I don‚Äôt want it to be special but still end up being let down. I hate it so much and wish it would just pass like any other day. I‚Äôm a grown ass adult and feel like a child because I would rather lay in bed all day than to expect people to make it special, then they try to make it special while just wishing they wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs selfish, I know. I‚Äôm a mess.",767,146,1586704945,"Yeah. Shit sucks honestly. You're not alone.

Never got any attention or anything special for my past couple birthdays. On my 18th bday, nobody except a few close friends and family wished me a happy birthday. Didn't get any presents from anyone. Ever since I haven't expected anything at all to come out of the rest.

Also, happy birthday :)",106,Mine_CTM,"I guess I'm sort of the opposite?   
I have social anxiety and would much rather no one make a big deal about it and would rather it not be ""special"" as it makes me super anxious. I especially hate having birthday parties and celebrating and would much rather just be left alone like a normal day.",38,AnxiousTeen16,"I totally get this. Birthday expectations are such a weird emotional rollercoaster - you simultaneously want it to be special while also wanting everyone to ignore it, and then feel guilty for feeling either way. You're definitely not alone in this.

Here's what helped me: I started taking control of my birthday by planning exactly what I want (even if that means absolutely nothing). Some years I explicitly tell people ""I'm treating this like a normal day"" and other years I plan something small just for myself - like ordering my favorite takeout and watching movies in peace. 

It's not selfish to have complicated feelings about your birthday. The whole ""special day"" pressure can be really overwhelming, especially when you're not sure what you want or how you want to feel about it.

You're not a mess - you're just a human being dealing with a legitimately complex emotional situation. Be gentle with yourself today. And happy birthday, if you want it - or just happy regular Thursday if you prefer that instead. üôÇ","

8hvlpl,Anxiety,Does anyone else get upset and hurt when your posts or comments get downvoted?,carb-queen,I just joined reddit the other day and I‚Äôm feeling like it‚Äôs really not good for my mental health. Whenever something gets downvoted I feel like people are thinking bad things about me or I said something wrong and I feel stupid. It‚Äôs like high school social anxiety all over again,766,147,1525774825,"Down votes could be a good way to train your mind to accept criticism from other people, especially that they are from people you don't know.. So try not to take it personally...",240,amuletofchange,[removed],-9,[deleted],"I totally get this feeling - seeing those downvotes can really sting, especially when you're new here. I struggled with the same thing when I first joined Reddit. It's completely normal to feel sensitive about it.

Here's what helped me: Remember that downvotes often have nothing to do with you as a person. Sometimes people downvote because they disagree, they're having a bad day, or they're just following what others did. Plus, Reddit can be pretty random about what gets upvoted or downvoted - even great comments sometimes get buried.

Maybe try focusing on smaller, friendlier subreddits that match your interests? Communities like r/CasualConversation tend to be more welcoming. And it's totally okay to take breaks when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Don't let imaginary internet points define your worth. You're not stupid, and you're not doing anything wrong. It takes time to get comfortable with how Reddit works, and your feelings are completely valid. üíú","

8vtkqi,Anxiety,"Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?",anetanetanet,"**EDIT:** Wow I didn't think I'd get this many comments. I'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! 

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. 

I especially have this with groups of teenagers, I'm genuinely afraid of them lol

If I'm in a group I might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.

What's your experience been with this? Did you eventually get over it? ",799,114,1530635249,I get this sometimes and I'm in my 30s. I don't think it's an age thing. I think it's related to social anxiety and that intense feeling of being judged by everyone....being hyperaware in social settings.,138,[deleted],"Lol why do you care about teenagers? They are still experiencing life and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. 

At my undergrad, people would laugh at me bc they knew I was a lesbian. No joke, it was so stupid. I knew this bc some people would whisper and think I couldn‚Äôt hear them. I didn‚Äôt give a shit bc it meant they‚Äôre just immature and not yet fit for a society of diverse people. ",-3,RobynHood-,"This is so relatable - I dealt with similar bullying growing up and that hyper-awareness of other people's laughter definitely sticks with you. It's like your brain got wired to assume the worst after years of actual negative experiences.

What helped me was realizing that as an adult, most people are way too wrapped up in their own lives to even notice others around them, let alone mock them. Those groups of laughing people? They're probably cracking up about some TikTok or inside joke between themselves.

The fear of teenagers makes total sense too - they represent that difficult time in your life. But you're not that vulnerable kid anymore. You're an adult who survived those experiences and came out stronger.

It takes time to rewire those thought patterns, but try to challenge that automatic ""they're laughing at me"" assumption when it pops up. Ask yourself what evidence you actually have versus what your anxiety is telling you.

You're not ridiculous for feeling this way - trauma responses don't just disappear because we've grown up. Be patient with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

ed5jr6,Anxiety,I got a 4.0 this semester in college!,vaguefully," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.",877,35,1576818988,"I also suffer from depression and anxiety, along with PTSD.

Getting a 4.0 is amazing on its own, but doing it while battling anxiety, health issues, and isolation? That's absolutely remarkable.

I love that you're not just celebrating your success but also using it to encourage others. Your advice about accommodations and communicating with professors is spot-on - so many students suffer in silence when help is actually available.

As someone who also deals with anxiety, I know how exhausting it can be to constantly fight those internal battles while trying to maintain academic performance. Each assignment probably felt like climbing a mountain, but you kept going. That resilience is worth so much more than just the grades themselves.

Please take some time to truly celebrate this achievement. You didn't just succeed academically - you proved to yourself just how capable you are, even under extremely challenging circumstances. You've earned every bit of this success.

Hoping you can get some well-deserved rest over the break! üéâ","

I dealt with similar fears about losing loved ones and would lie awake running through worst-case scenarios in my head.

What helped me was creating a ""wind-down"" routine about an hour before bed. I dim the lights, do some light stretching, and write down my worries in a journal. Something about getting them out of my head and onto paper makes them feel more manageable. I also started listening to sleep stories or nature sounds to give my mind something gentle to focus on instead of my anxious thoughts.

Remember that worrying about something doesn't prevent it from happening - it just steals peace from your present moment. Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you develop specific coping strategies for these intrusive thoughts.

You're not alone in this. Nighttime anxiety is really common, and while it might not go away completely overnight, there are ways to make it more manageable. Be gentle with yourself as you work through this. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

gkttro,Anxiety,Does anyone else‚Äôs anxiety cause abdominal issues?,SensitiveBorder2,"After moving a year and a half ago I started having bouts of severe abdominal cramping followed with...lets just say it sped things up. This has happened once or twice a month for 17 months now and I never had prior issues. My doc thinks it‚Äôs just irritable bowel (a really common thing especially with anxiety) I‚Äôm worried about something like Crohn‚Äôs disease with how bad the cramping can get. All my bloods were normal except low B12 implying some level of malabsorption.

Still I‚Äôm just curious if anyone with anxiety like me has had GI upset from it often, I never had issues before but obviously moving was quite a jump and stressful time.

From my understands it‚Äôs a fairly common anxiety symptom. I often get an upset stomach on anxious days.,129,[deleted],"Yes, and I have Crohn‚Äôs too. For me, I can feel the difference between the anxiety cramps and then the rush it causes, and a Crohns flare up or the standard Crohns pain. The burning cramping feeling for me is always anxiety related and an IBS issue, whereas for me, Crohns feels like my intestines are trying to digest glass. But if you feel like something really isn‚Äôt right, then ask for a second opinion. I was misdiagnosed for 5 years before I got the correct diagnosis and treatment!",1,preachitpickle,"I deal with very similar issues and can totally relate. The gut-brain connection is incredibly strong, and anxiety can absolutely wreak havoc on your digestive system. When I'm going through particularly stressful periods, my IBS symptoms flare up significantly.

It's good that you've gotten medical tests done to rule out more serious conditions. While the cramping is definitely scary and uncomfortable, IBS triggered by anxiety is extremely common and manageable. Some things that have helped me:

- Keeping a food/stress diary to identify triggers
- Deep breathing exercises, especially during meals
- Peppermint tea for cramping
- Regular exercise (helps both anxiety and digestion)
- Working with a therapist to manage anxiety

The fact that this started after a big move makes a lot of sense - major life changes are huge anxiety triggers. While it's always good to stay on top of your health, try not to let health anxiety make your symptoms worse (easier said than done, I know!).

Consider working with both a GI doctor and mental health professional to develop a comprehensive management plan. You're definitely not alone in this!","

jn9o4i,Anxiety,"Terrorist attack happened in my city yesterday, I feel like I'm going to break down",OrdinaryCow7,"Yesterday evening my city was hit by a terrible terrorist attack. Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside. 

Whoever read this far, thank you. I don't even know why I wrote this. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it somehow.",839,70,1604407676,I‚Äôm so sorry,167,SuccessfulPast9,I‚Äôm so sorry,167,SuccessfulPast9,"I'm so sorry you're going through this traumatic experience. What you're feeling - the anxiety, fear, and difficulty concentrating - are completely normal reactions to witnessing such a horrific event in a place that's so familiar and important to you. Please don't feel guilty about struggling right now - this is a genuinely traumatic situation.

Regarding your exam tomorrow, I strongly encourage you to reach out to your professor or academic advisor immediately. Most universities have protocols for students affected by traumatic events and can offer accommodations. You shouldn't have to choose between your mental health and your academics right now.

And please do call your therapist - you don't need to know exactly what to say. Simply telling them what you've shared here is enough. They can help you process these feelings and develop coping strategies for the coming days.

In the meantime, try to limit your exposure to news coverage and graphic content of the attack. Focus on basic self-care - staying hydrated, eating when you can, and connecting with loved ones who make you feel safe.

This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside. 

Whoever read this far, thank you. I don't even know why I wrote this. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it somehow.

8slguo,Anxiety,Didn't go to a party due to anxiety and now I have anxiety because I didn't go,RainingAtmosphere,"This is SO silly but there was a little party today at my university and my stomach was twisting in knots about going so I skipped it even though my sorta-friends were going. I just stayed at home for hours pretty much doing nothing, feeling sad for no reason, but I was under the impression we would all go to a club tonight anyways so I figured i'd save up my social energy for that. And my roommates came home and don't want to go to the club anymore, so now I'm feeling awful and anxious and so sad that I didn't go, I SHOULD have gone and now I have so much regret and anxiety that I missed out. I think I would have had so much fun but yet again I feel like I missed out, and wasted my night. This keeps happening, I really have to get better at forcing myself to just do things...",851,58,1529524913,"You may try making a little pact with yourself before you go. Like, I'll stay for 30 minutes and if I'm not having a good time, I'll leave. Quite a few times I've done this, and when the 30 minutes are up most of my anxiety has subsided and I'll end up staying and having fun. Just getting out the door if often the hardest part for me. 

If you do decide to stay home, stick to it! Find something fun to do solo so you don't end up wondering what's happening at the party and thinking about what you're missing out on.

Good luck! As someone with social anxiety, I can totally relate to this.",203,strangeXpowers,"Oh I know this feel very well. It just shows you how stupid those false alarms of anxiety are. It's a useless feeling that just scares you without reason and causes you pain regardless of what you do.

Try not to let anxiety take over and stop you from doing something you want to do. The more you let it bar you from events and parties, the harder it will be to break out of that thought pattern. Next time try pushing yourself a bit more, and eventually you will be able to go and have fun without being freaked out. Good luck!",3,Pandasticus,"I totally get this cycle - the anxiety before an event, choosing not to go, then feeling anxious about not going. It's such a frustrating loop that many of us with social anxiety experience.

Try to be gentle with yourself about today. You weren't being silly or weak - anxiety is a real challenge that can make these decisions really difficult. Instead of dwelling on what you ""should"" have done, maybe use this as a learning experience for next time.

One thing that helps me is making a commitment to say ""yes"" to the next social invitation, no matter what. Then when anxiety hits, I can tell myself ""I already decided I'm going"" rather than debating it in the moment. Start small - maybe a coffee meetup or lunch rather than a big party.

The fact that you recognize this pattern and want to work on it is actually a really positive sign. Each time you push through the anxiety and go to something, it gets a tiny bit easier. You've got this! üí™","

f8xi8b,Anxiety,Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.,CaptainPasty,"I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

EDIT: Thanks for the award stranger. I'm glad it cheered someone else up too!",864,45,1582575969,"no need to be shy and insecure around girls specifically! they are also human like guys are and arent some weirdos. just dont think about everyone liking you in some complicated way, be yourself, stay calm and act the way you like (be decent tho) and im sure you ll get many more smiles!",122,immortalycerine,"One of the thing I learned about my anxiety is that it lies about how attractive I am. I'm not model material but I don't look as much like Alan Rickman as my anxiety would have me believe. Besides, who doesn't want to date Hans Gruber, Metatron and Snape?",31,hamfisted_postman,"That's awesome man! It's amazing how such a small moment can feel like such a big victory when you're working on building confidence. I totally get that instinct to look away - I used to do the same thing all the time.

Here's something that helped me: realizing that making eye contact and smiling is actually a really normal, friendly human interaction. Most people respond positively to it, just like that girl did today. You're not being weird or creepy by acknowledging someone's existence with a brief look and smile.

Try to remember how good this moment felt, and use it as proof that you're more capable than your insecurities want you to believe. You didn't burst into flames, she didn't laugh at you - instead, you got a genuine smile back! That's how most of these little interactions go when we give them a chance.

Keep building on this. Each small win makes the next one easier. Proud of you for pushing through that comfort zone today!","

Stay realistic too.  One accepted date does not make her your girlfriend exactly.  Don't rush things.  It's easy to get over-eager and scare a person off.",49,cornbadger,"Congrats, that's awesome! It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there again after going through a bad relationship. Those experiences can really mess with your confidence and make you hesitant to try again.

The fact that you worked through your anxiety and took that chance shows real personal growth. And the best part is it paid off! It must feel great knowing that someone you've been interested in feels the same way about you.

Just remember to take things at whatever pace feels comfortable for you. There's no rush, and it's totally okay if you still have some lingering anxieties - that's completely normal. The right person will understand and be patient.

gozgvh,Anxiety,I am so proud of my wife,underwaterdude1,"My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn‚Äôt pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn‚Äôt want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said ‚Äú I know you need me tonight but I don‚Äôt know if I am strong enough.‚Äù She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. ‚ÄúBut I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.‚Äù 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn‚Äôt have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come.",879,29,1590211622,"This makes me super happy.

Although I‚Äôm not married I‚Äôve been with my partner for 5 years now and go through pretty much what you mentioned.

Feel free to send a PM or chat request if you wanna tLk.",15,cryingmetsfan,"This is such a beautiful moment of growth for both of you. It's incredibly challenging to navigate a relationship where one partner has severe anxiety, especially when it affects your ability to express your own needs. The fact that your wife was able to acknowledge her limitations (""I don't know if I'm strong enough"") while still pushing through to support you shows remarkable progress.

I can tell you're being really patient and understanding with her journey, but don't forget that your needs are just as important. Maybe you could work with her therapist (if she has one) to develop strategies for these situations - like having a code word for when you really need support, or establishing a calm-down routine that works for both of you.

The fact that she was able to stay present and support you, even while fighting her own anxiety, is huge. It shows that all the work you've both been putting in is paying off. Keep celebrating these victories - they're stepping stones to an even stronger relationship.

Wishing you both continued growth and healing together.","

Here's what I've learned though - those feelings of self-doubt and anxiety don't mean you're failing at being an adult. They're actually super common, even among people who seem to have it all together. The real difference between kid-you and adult-you isn't the absence of fear or doubt - it's learning to move forward despite those feelings.

It's great that you're trying CBT! Keep in mind that therapy is often like working out - you might not see results right away, but small changes add up over time. The fact that you're actively working on this stuff shows you're more capable than you give yourself credit for.

Also, remember that your childhood self didn't know how complex adult life would be. They were imagining a simplified version of adulthood. You're dealing with the real thing, and you're doing better than you think. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

Like listening to a lecture and the professor's mic crackles, or the sink faucet spurts a little bit, stuff like that.

Is this an anxiety thing? Constantly feeling like you're about to be jumpscared?

It's to do with the amygdala which is typically smaller and overactive in people with anxiety disorders.

It's called an ""exaggerated startle response"" and it's really normal for people with anxiety. Your body is basically in a heightened state of alertness, so you react more intensely to unexpected stimuli.

I deal with this too - I've literally jumped at my own shadow before! It's because when you have anxiety, your nervous system is already on ""high alert"" mode, so even small surprises can trigger that fight-or-flight response. It's not something you're choosing to do or being dramatic about.

If it's really bothering you, there are some things that can help reduce it over time:
- Regular exercise to burn off excess nervous energy
- Mindfulness/meditation to help calm your nervous system
- Therapy to work on the underlying anxiety

Don't feel embarrassed about it - it's just your body trying to protect you, even if it's being a bit overzealous about it. Your friends might notice it, but it's just part of who you are and nothing to be ashamed of.","

Seeing those downvotes can make you second-guess everything you wrote and wonder what you did ""wrong,"" even if you didn't actually do anything wrong. It's a very human reaction.

Here's something that helped me: Remember that downvotes often have nothing to do with you as a person. Sometimes people downvote because they're having a bad day, they misunderstood your point, or they just disagree - and disagreement doesn't mean you're wrong. Reddit can also be pretty random about what gets up/downvoted.

Try not to delete your posts right away. Give them time to breathe - sometimes early downvotes turn into upvotes later, and even if they don't, your perspective might still be valuable to someone who needs to hear it.

If you find yourself getting really affected by votes, it might help to take short breaks from Reddit or stick to smaller, more supportive communities. Your mental well-being is more important than karma.

The fact that you're standing up to it shows real strength. You're not letting it define you, even when it's being particularly loud and obnoxious. That's actually huge.

Keep fighting the good fight. And remember, it's okay to reach out for support, whether that's through therapy, friends, or communities like this one. We're all in this battle together, and sometimes just knowing you're not alone in telling anxiety to shut up can make it a little more bearable.

But I am getting weird anxiety over how I look and feeling super self conscious about my appearance all the time.

I've no idea why, it's not been much of an issue before. I definitely don't need a new thing to worry about! It's so exhausting that stresses like this never seem to truly stop, even when I think I'm getting better. 

Edit: I finally managed to read all these comments now I'm home from work. Thank you everyone for making me feel like I'm not on my own in this!

You finally get one worry under control, and your brain goes ""Hey, but what about THIS thing?"" It's actually really common with anxiety disorders; when we're wired to worry, our minds tend to find something to focus that energy on.

The good news is that you've already proven you can manage anxiety successfully - look at how far you've come with work and social stuff! Those same coping skills can help with these new appearance concerns too. The fact that this is a new worry might actually be a sign of progress - your brain is running out of its usual material to stress about.

Have you considered talking to a therapist? They can help you identify these anxiety patterns and develop strategies that work across different types of worries, rather than just tackling them one at a time. Plus, it's exhausting dealing with this alone.

Keep being proud of the progress you've made. Anxiety is tricky, but you're clearly getting better at handling it, even if it doesn't always feel that way.","

POST BODY: I've been doing a lot better lately with not panicking over work and social events and making life plans. But I am getting weird anxiety over how I look and feeling super self conscious about my appearance all the time.

I've no idea why, it's not been much of an issue before. I definitely don't need a new thing to worry about! It's so exhausting that stresses like this never seem to truly stop, even when I think I'm getting better. 

Edit: I finally managed to read all these comments now I'm home from work. Thank you everyone for making me feel like I'm not on my own in this! Some of you have made me think I might need to try the doctor/therapist route again because I think I can only get so far on my own. Overall though, today was a good day! I hope you have all had a good day too :)

gdfekk,Anxiety,Apparently May is Mental Health Month and I‚Äôve officially decided to seek help!,swagachu11,"I‚Äôve been on medication before and I don‚Äôt love it-but that‚Äôs not to say that it doesn‚Äôt help.

So now that covid is taking over and my anxiety is getting a lot worse I‚Äôve officially decided to reach out to some therapists in my area. Fingers crossed I find a good one!

Please remember if you meet with a professional that you dont find helpful or theres not a connection, you can always try a new one. 

I know it's hard to have to work at getting help but itll pay off in the long run if you take an active part in your recovery.",34,ADSwasAISloveDKS,Same. Should be getting the call today goodluck!!,2,DivineIntentions,"This is such a positive step - proud of you for making the decision to seek help! It's completely valid that medication wasn't the right fit for you personally. Mental health support isn't one-size-fits-all, and therapy can be an amazing alternative or complement to other treatments.

A tip for finding the right therapist: Don't feel bad about ""shopping around"" a bit. It's totally normal to have initial consultations with a few different therapists before finding one you click with. The therapeutic relationship is really important, so finding someone you feel comfortable with makes a huge difference.

And you're absolutely right - the pandemic has been rough on so many people's mental health, especially those dealing with anxiety. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Reaching out for support during these challenging times shows real self-awareness and strength.

Wishing you the best of luck finding a therapist who's a good match! Keep us posted on how it goes if you feel comfortable sharing. üí™","

Those dark nights can feel impossibly long and lonely, but you did it - you're still here, and that takes incredible strength. Please don't worry about responding to everyone right now.

afxcrm,Anxiety,Anxiety over replying to texts/emails?,givemeajetpack,"I get soooo anxious over replying to texts and emails. I'll avoid the most basic of messages for days, weeks, or sometimes even months. I don't completely understand my thought process but I think it goes something like this:

1. Receive text/email. Feel some anxiety over what to say back so I put it off.
2. Put it off long enough that I feel that too much time has passed for me to answer without it being weird.
3. Experience mounting anxiety and my mental block grows as days go by without me answering.
4. Convince myself that the person who sent me the text/email in the first place now hates me and thinks of me as lazy/irresponsible/uncaring.

Does anyone else have this problem? How have you been able to work through it?

&amp;#x200B;",804,100,1547482688,"I was literally coming here to write this. I am currently ignoring an email from my therapist because I‚Äôm too scared to open it. MY LITERAL THERAPIST WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT MY ANXIETY. I hate it, I don‚Äôt know how people just send emails and texts without worrying about it. ",122,Massigoux_Cat,,0,,"I struggle with this exact same thing! That spiral of ""too much time has passed now"" followed by even more anxiety is so real. You're definitely not alone in this.

What's helped me is setting a simple rule: if I can respond in under 2 minutes, I do it immediately. No overthinking allowed. For longer messages, I give myself permission to draft something quick like ""Thanks for your message! I'll get back to you properly soon"" - this takes the immediate pressure off while acknowledging the person.

Also, remember that most people are way more understanding than we imagine. They're usually just living their lives, not obsessing over our response times. I've had friends reply after weeks with a simple ""Sorry for the delay!"" and honestly, I was just happy to hear from them.

Maybe start small - pick one delayed message and respond today, even if it feels awkward. Breaking that anxiety cycle with action, even imperfectly, can help reduce the power it has over you.","

They‚Äôre my favorite comfort viewing.",89,PitchOk5203,"This is totally normal and actually really common! I do the exact same thing with The Office and Parks & Recreation. There's something incredibly comforting about watching shows you know by heart - it's predictable, familiar, and doesn't require emotional energy to process new content when you're already feeling overwhelmed.

It's like comfort food for your brain. You know exactly what's coming, there are no unexpected stressors, and you can just let your mind relax into something familiar. Plus, if you've chosen comedies or feel-good shows, they can help shift your mood in a positive direction.

I've actually read that this is a pretty common coping mechanism - lots of people use familiar shows as a form of self-soothing during anxiety. The predictability helps counter the chaos that anxiety creates in our minds. So please don't feel crazy! You've found something that works for you, and that's what matters.

BTW, Lord of the Rings is an excellent choice - those movies are like a warm blanket on a cold day! üôÇ","

You handled the rejection like a champ too. A lot of people would take that personally or let it discourage them, but you've got exactly the right mindset about it. There are plenty of other opportunities out there, and each time you do this, it gets a little easier.

The fact that she smiled and was polite about it shows you probably approached her respectfully too, which is awesome. Keep that energy - confidence without being pushy is attractive.

Seriously, be proud of yourself. Breaking through anxiety barriers is tough work, and you just proved to yourself that you can do it. That's the kind of momentum that leads to good things, whether it's with dating or just life in general.

9g1bwv,Anxiety,Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,FleshEatinThugRpllnt,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.
Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down. Sorry for the rant, and thanks for your time if you did choose to read through this, I hope you all lead long, fulfilling lifes.

P.S. Idk if I should start going to counselling for issues like this, do you think it could be beneficial to someone like me?",799,104,1537016952,"I find alcohol makes my anxiety flare up the day after, if I had got really drunk the night before. I didn't drink super often  but  the after effects I experienced mentally were bad enough to make me quit completely for a while. 

I agree it can be easier to come out of your shell, but for me at least finding balance with drinking was important. I have to drink slowly and don't ever get full on wasted anymore. The buzz helps me feel comfortable partying/talking with people/even singing karaoke but does not leave me with anxiety attacks or insecurity the next day.  

It's easy to over analyze yourself and your actions after sobering up. Can you talk to the people you were with, maybe get some reassurance about how they were receiving you? It can be anxiety inducing to have those conversations but if it's just you over analyzing, talking to them could really help you feel better.

",155,BuggySeance,"What you're describing is actually really common - it's called ""hangxiety"" (hangover anxiety) and lots of people experience it. The alcohol temporarily reduces your social anxiety while drinking, but then your brain chemistry rebounds the next day, often making you feel worse and overthink everything.

The fact that you feel you need alcohol to socialize is worth paying attention to. While it's normal to feel more outgoing when drinking, relying on it as your main way to interact with people can lead down an unhealthy path.

And yes, counseling could be really helpful! A therapist can help you work through your social anxiety and develop confidence in social situations without needing alcohol as a crutch. They can also give you tools to manage those post-drinking anxiety spirals.

Don't be too hard on yourself about last night. Most people are too focused on their own actions to critically analyze yours, and what feels like a huge social mistake to you probably went completely unnoticed by others.

Take care of yourself, and definitely consider giving counseling a try. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to seek help.","

I did something similar when I moved cities last year and found that going out alone actually helped me meet new people more easily than when I was with friends. You're more approachable and likely to strike up conversations when flying solo.

qrij6t,Anxiety,"Stop telling me to take deep, slow breaths/be mindful",orchidlighthouse,"I‚Äôm so annoyed when someone tells me I need to take deep slow breaths/use mindfulness and meditation to manage my anxiety. My anxiety feels like a train about to run me over, complete with intense, obsessional, and paranoid thinking about how I may or may not have messed up at work/how someone probably doesn‚Äôt like me/how I‚Äôm an awful person and ruined something, etc. Yet you want me to ‚Äúlisten to my breaths,‚Äù be mindful of my body and think about seagulls on a beach. Is there anything else you‚Äôd like me to do? Sprout wings and fly?",771,130,1636627164,"I think some people have touched on this already. To give it some emphasis - the time to practice mindfulness/breathing is *not* when you're in crisis. And by ""practice"", I mean building up those skills so that you learn how to use them effectively.

If someone handed you a musical instrument you don't play and told you to walk out onto a stage with an audience and an orchestra waiting and perform a random concerto, you wouldn't be able to do that, either. However, by taking small steps in a safe place, you can learn enough to build up your skills and your confidence to use those skills in an intense situation.

Genuinely, one of the things that can help an anxiety attack is using mindfulness to embrace the feeling instead of resisting it. But to get to the point where that helps instead of hurts? It takes SO. MUCH. WORK. If you can do that work, it can help enormously. Most likely, it will not be easy, nor will you see results quickly. For me, in combination with other tools, it has made a huge difference in reducing the frequency and intensity of panic episodes.",228,asliceofpi,"There is actually this funny but accurate video that was going around YouTube, check it out, it is called ""what if we talked about physical health the way we talk about mental health"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWA0es85hMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWA0es85hMs) 

It is just the not so helpful and really rude things people say to those of us experiencing mental health issues. Your post just made me thing of that. 

Sometimes advice comes from a good place, but people need to realize that they are not being helpful and sometimes making things worse.

I hope you find something that works for you and find some relief!",12,justgettingby2021,"I totally get your frustration. When you're in the grip of intense anxiety that feels like being hit by a freight train of racing thoughts and paranoia, being told to ""just breathe"" can feel dismissive and even a bit insulting. It's like telling someone with a broken leg to ""walk it off.""

While breathing exercises and mindfulness can be helpful tools for some people, they're not a one-size-fits-all solution, especially for severe anxiety. Have you considered working with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders? They can help you develop coping strategies that actually match the intensity of what you're experiencing - whether that's CBT, exposure therapy, or even medication if appropriate.

In the meantime, instead of fighting those intrusive thoughts or trying to force yourself to relax, sometimes it helps to just acknowledge ""Yep, my anxiety is being a real jerk right now"" and let those thoughts pass through without engaging them. No seagulls or beach visualization required.

You're not broken, and you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Anxiety this intense deserves real support, not just well-meaning but oversimplified advice.","

Absolutely. I use it to distract me from my thoughts but it just exacerbates them sometimes.",107,[deleted],Delete your Facebook. You'll see noticable improvement within days.,3,NorthWoods16,"I totally get this - phone addiction is especially tough when you're actually relying on it for important life stuff like apartment/roommate hunting and car shopping. It's like you're caught between needing to be connected and feeling overwhelmed by it.

Here's what helped me: Set specific times to check those important things (like apartment listings) instead of constantly refreshing. Maybe 2-3 scheduled checks per day. For everything else, try using app timers - most phones have these built in now. Start with something manageable like 1 hour per app.

The anxiety piece is real though. When you're dealing with a difficult living situation and big life changes, the phone becomes this weird comfort/anxiety cycle. Have you tried replacing some phone time with other anxiety-managing activities? Even simple stuff like taking a walk, journaling, or doing a puzzle can help break that cycle.

Don't beat yourself up about it. You're going through a lot right now, and it's normal to seek comfort where you can find it. Focus on making small changes while being kind to yourself.","

858mjn,Anxiety,"Telling someone with Anxiety to ""calm down,"" is like telling someone with Allergies to ""Stop and smell the roses.""",BetaTekt,Just thought I'd share this showerthought.. ,850,49,1521340588,Love it. Never in the history of the world has an anxious person been helped by being told to calm down or relax.,73,TherapistWow,,0,,"This is such an accurate analogy. As someone who has dealt with anxiety, hearing ""just calm down"" or ""don't worry about it"" can actually make things worse because now I'm not only anxious, but I'm also feeling guilty about being anxious.

What's helped me is when people instead say things like ""I'm here with you"" or ""What do you need right now?"" It acknowledges that anxiety isn't something you can just switch off - it's a real physiological response that needs understanding and support.

For anyone dealing with someone who has anxiety, try asking how you can help rather than telling them how they should feel. Sometimes just sitting quietly with someone or helping them focus on slow breathing is more valuable than any advice. Think of it like helping someone through an asthma attack - you wouldn't tell them to ""just breathe normally,"" you'd help them work through it with patience and support.

Just like allergies, anxiety is a real medical response that deserves to be taken seriously. Great shower thought that really puts it in perspective!","

a9kws0,Anxiety,Just got engaged!,no_tread_on_snek,I was so so nervous but it went well and she said yes. So happy. ,834,64,1545793767,Congratulations. I proposed last night and she said no.

That moment when they say ""yes"" is absolutely incredible, isn't it? The build-up of nerves and then that rush of pure joy - there's really nothing quite like it. 

Pro tip from someone who's been there: take some time to just enjoy this special moment together before diving into wedding planning. The first few days of being engaged are magical, and it's worth soaking that in. Maybe plan a nice dinner just the two of you to celebrate, or call your closest friends/family together for a small engagement celebration.

Don't worry if the proposal wasn't ""perfect"" or if you stumbled over your words (most of us do!) - what matters is that you both chose each other and are starting this amazing new chapter together.

Wishing you both all the happiness in the world! üéâüíç","

We should have better treatment against this hell.",662,236,1666094695,"I think, in my opinion, it's because the systems that led to our anxiety haven't changed. Precarious housing, shitty jobs, shitty people doing shitty things to other people. Lack of resources, lack of support and caring communities. We're expected to solve our feelings from within, as if external factors can be ignored or ""overcome"".",963,boisnoise,Idk I think we have overall good options for anxiety. They aren't quick fixes so a lot of people fall off the bandwagon.,7,glad_reaper,"I totally feel your frustration. It seems crazy that with all our medical and scientific advances, anxiety can still have such a devastating impact on people's lives. While treatment has improved over the years (we have more therapy options and medications than ever), it can still feel inadequate when you're in the thick of it.

The tricky thing about anxiety is that it affects everyone differently, so there's no one-size-fits-all solution. What works great for one person might do nothing for another. Have you been able to work with a mental health professional? Sometimes it takes trying different approaches (CBT, medication, mindfulness, etc.) or combinations of treatments to find what clicks for you.

Don't give up hope though. Research is ongoing and new treatments are being developed. In the meantime, communities like this one can help - you're definitely not alone in this struggle. If you're looking for immediate resources, I'd be happy to share some coping techniques that have helped others manage their anxiety.

Hang in there. Your frustration is valid, and you deserve to find relief that works for you.","

What they did was completely inappropriate and violated your personal boundaries - no one should EVER physically force you to do something after you've clearly said no. Your reaction was totally valid and understandable. Being physically handled against your will can be incredibly triggering and traumatic.

Please know that you did nothing wrong by setting boundaries or by needing to leave to take care of yourself. That guy was way out of line, both with trying to force you into VR and with being careless enough to hit you afterward. A ""safe place"" means respecting people's boundaries and autonomy.

If you feel comfortable, you might want to talk to the host about what happened. They seemed responsive when they noticed you were upset, and they should know how their other guest's behavior affected you. This could help prevent similar situations in the future.

Take care of yourself while processing this. There's no timeline for getting over a violating experience like that. Your feelings of helplessness and distress are completely valid.","

Magnesium deficiency is actually pretty common and can definitely contribute to anxiety symptoms. I've had similar experiences - started taking magnesium for muscle tension and was surprised when it helped calm my racing thoughts too.

Just a friendly heads up - make sure you're taking a well-absorbed form like magnesium glycinate or citrate (oxide isn't absorbed as well). And while it's great that you're seeing such positive results, it's always smart to keep your doctor in the loop about supplements.

It's such a relief when you finally find something that helps after struggling with anxiety for so long. I hope you continue to experience these benefits! Keep in mind that while magnesium is helping, it might be worth exploring other anxiety management tools too (therapy, meditation, etc.) to build a complete toolkit for your mental health.

Thanks for sharing your experience - posts like these can really help others who are looking for natural ways to manage their anxiety.","

That constant pressure of ""I should be doing more"" or ""I'm falling behind"" is so mentally exhausting, especially in your early 20s when it feels like everyone else has their life figured out (spoiler: they don't).

Here's something that helped me shift my perspective: Your 20s aren't a deadline, they're a starting point. You're literally at the beginning of your adult life. I know so many people who found their passion in their 30s, changed careers in their 40s, or discovered new purposes even later.

Try to catch yourself when you're creating these arbitrary age markers. Ask yourself: ""Who decided this was the timeline? Is this pressure actually helping me, or is it just making me feel worse?""

You're not failing - you're learning and growing, which is exactly what you're supposed to be doing at 21. The best version of yourself isn't a destination you reach by a certain age - it's a continuous journey that lasts your whole life.

Be gentle with yourself. You have so much time ahead of you, I promise.","

As someone who also struggled with driving anxiety, I know exactly how huge this achievement is.

One piece of advice that helped me: remember that confidence comes with experience. Take it slow, maybe start with quiet roads during off-peak hours, and gradually work your way up to busier situations. There's no rush - you've already done the hardest part by getting your license.

Thanks for sharing your story. It's really inspiring for others who might be in the same position you were in. You're proof that driving anxiety doesn't have to be permanent, and that's a powerful message for anyone else struggling with this fear. Enjoy your new freedom! üöó","

Here's the thing - hookup culture can make us hyper-focused on specific body parts, but real sexual chemistry is about so much more. Confidence (even if you have to fake it at first), attentiveness to your partner, and building anticipation through foreplay are what make memorable encounters.

If someone judges you solely on size, that's their loss. The right partners will appreciate you for the full package of who you are and how you make them feel. Keep working on building that confidence - it sounds like you've got the skills and mindset to be a great partner, regardless of size.","

Have you considered talking to a mental health professional? They can be really helpful in breaking down these complex feelings, especially when dealing with both depression and health anxiety. Sometimes just having someone validate that your struggles are real can be the first step forward.

In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. You don't have to force happiness - sometimes just getting through the day is enough. Maybe focus on small things that bring even tiny moments of peace or distraction, whether that's a hot shower, a favorite song, or petting a cat.

You're not alone in this. Many of us have been in that same dark place, and while it might not feel like it now, things can get better with the right support and tools. Hang in there, friend.","

Nice job overcoming it,5,BigFuckHead_,"That's amazing, and you absolutely should feel proud! Making medical appointments and actually going through with them can be really anxiety-inducing, especially that first phone call. I remember how my heart would race every time I had to call for an appointment when I first started doing it on my own.

Each of those steps - making the call, getting yourself there, checking in - they're all separate victories. And now that you've done it once, I promise it gets easier every time after this. You're building really important life skills that you'll use forever.

Don't minimize this by calling them ""baby steps"" - they're real steps forward in taking charge of your own healthcare, which is a huge part of becoming independent. You faced your anxiety and pushed through it. That's something to celebrate! 

Keep this feeling in mind next time you need to make an appointment. You've proven to yourself that you can do it! üí™","

This article has some really helpful tips on how to deal with phone anxiety:   [https://www.verywellmind.com/afraid-making-phone-calls-tips-3024317](https://www.verywellmind.com/afraid-making-phone-calls-tips-3024317)",59,Laell-Daeva,,0,,"Yes! Phone anxiety is super common - you're definitely not alone in this. I used to get that exact same knot in my stomach and would literally pace around my apartment working up the courage to make important calls.

What helped me was:
- Writing down key points before making calls so I feel more prepared
- Starting with ""easier"" calls (like ordering takeout) to build confidence
- Reminding myself that the person on the other end is just another human doing their job
- Setting specific times for making calls rather than letting them loom over me all day
- Using breathing exercises right before calling (sounds cheesy but it helps!)

Also, give yourself credit for recognizing this and wanting to work on it. Phone anxiety is a real thing that many people struggle with, not some personal failing. Start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that each call you make - even if it feels awkward - is helping you build that confidence muscle.

It does get easier with practice, I promise! üí™","

I used to (and sometimes still do) agonize over every message, trying to get the tone and wording just perfect. It's exhausting, right?

Something that really helped me was reminding myself that most people aren't analyzing our texts nearly as intensely as we are. They're probably just reading it quickly between activities and responding based on their schedule, not because of anything ""wrong"" with our message.

Try this: Before sending a text, ask yourself ""Would I judge a friend this harshly for sending this exact same message?"" Usually, the answer is no. We're often our own worst critics.

Also, it's okay to take breaks from your phone after sending messages. Watching for those response bubbles can really feed the anxiety. Maybe put on a show or do something else you enjoy while waiting - it helps take the pressure off.

You're definitely not alone in this! üíú","

Try not to take it personally - for every negative person, there are many more supportive users who genuinely want to engage and help others.

I'd suggest focusing less on the votes and more on the meaningful interactions. Some of my best Reddit experiences have come from good conversations in the comments, regardless of karma. Remember that downvotes often say more about the voter than your actual comment.

It's totally normal to feel anxious about putting yourself out there, but don't let a few negative people stop you from participating. Maybe stick to smaller, more niche communities at first where people tend to be more supportive. And if you find yourself obsessing over votes, it's okay to step away for a bit or turn off vote notifications.

Keep being genuine and contributing thoughtfully - the right communities will appreciate that. And your mental health matters more than imaginary internet points! üíú","

As someone who also dealt with driving anxiety, I know exactly how massive this achievement is. The fact that you pushed through despite getting and letting permits expire multiple times shows incredible persistence - most people don't understand how paralyzing that fear can be.

What really resonates with me is how you focused on how great it would feel afterwards rather than getting caught up in anxiety techniques. Sometimes just keeping your eye on the end goal is the most powerful motivation.

Your story is going to give so much hope to others dealing with similar fears. You're proof that there's no ""right"" timeline - whether it takes 7 years or 17 years, what matters is that you did it when you were ready.

Enjoy your new freedom! The confidence boost from conquering such a significant fear tends to spill over into other areas of life too. You should be incredibly proud of yourself. üéâ","

I don't get it.",83,AnxietyMostofTheTime,,0,,"Hey there, what you're describing actually makes a lot of sense and you're definitely not alone in this. It's a pretty common anxiety pattern - sometimes our brains go into overdrive over small things but then kind of ""shut down"" during bigger situations as a protective mechanism. That dissociation you mentioned is actually your mind's way of coping when things feel too overwhelming.

Please don't hate yourself for this. Anxiety doesn't always follow logical rules, and that's okay. Have you considered talking to a counselor or therapist? They can help you develop strategies to manage both the anxiety attacks and the dissociation. In the meantime, learning some grounding techniques (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method where you name things you can see, touch, hear, etc.) can help when you feel yourself starting to disconnect.

For immediate situations like tonight - it's totally okay to wake your friend and ask for a blanket. True friends would rather help you be comfortable than have you suffering in silence. You deserve to take care of yourself, even in small ways.","

i‚Äôll use my old friend as an example. we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúA.‚Äù If i told A that i had a good day or did well on a test, she would roll her eyes &amp; say ‚Äúof course *you* did.‚Äù she always got mad whenever i had something positive happen in my life. even if it was as simple as getting something in the mail. 

she did have anxiety &amp; depression, so i‚Äôm totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i‚Äôve been envious of others before &amp; i‚Äôve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia &amp; depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn‚Äôt leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i‚Äôm not a very open person &amp; prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with ‚Äúoh well you should live a day in my life‚Äù or ‚Äúoh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.‚Äù i‚Äôm obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered &amp; she would respond with ‚Äúya well my family has been murdered twenty times.‚Äù 

it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people‚Äôs problems. that contributes to why i don‚Äôt open up. i‚Äôm always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven‚Äôt showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can‚Äôt bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don‚Äôt want to have a future &amp; i don‚Äôt feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren‚Äôt working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don‚Äôt believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can‚Äôt look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren‚Äôt valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don‚Äôt compare other people‚Äôs problems to theirs. don‚Äôt minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. üåªüñ§üåº",828,64,1611882946,"I hear you ... one comment that's imprinted into my brain comes to mind.

I hope you can find people (whether friends, family, or mental health professionals) who will truly listen and validate your experiences instead of comparing them to others. You're worthy of that kind of support. üíú","

POST TITLE: can we please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people‚Äôs problem? your problems are valid.

POST BODY: i‚Äôve had friends that minimize or compare my problems. i‚Äôve had teachers &amp; therapists &amp; social workers do it too. but either way... it needs to stop. 

i‚Äôll use my old friend as an example. we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúA.‚Äù If i told A that i had a good day or did well on a test, she would roll her eyes &amp; say ‚Äúof course *you* did.‚Äù she always got mad whenever i had something positive happen in my life. even if it was as simple as getting something in the mail. 

she did have anxiety &amp; depression, so i‚Äôm totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i‚Äôve been envious of others before &amp; i‚Äôve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia &amp; depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn‚Äôt leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i‚Äôm not a very open person &amp; prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with ‚Äúoh well you should live a day in my life‚Äù or ‚Äúoh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.‚Äù i‚Äôm obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered &amp; she would respond with ‚Äúya well my family has been murdered twenty times.‚Äù 

it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people‚Äôs problems. that contributes to why i don‚Äôt open up. i‚Äôm always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven‚Äôt showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can‚Äôt bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don‚Äôt want to have a future &amp; i don‚Äôt feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren‚Äôt working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don‚Äôt believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can‚Äôt look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren‚Äôt valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don‚Äôt compare other people‚Äôs problems to theirs. don‚Äôt minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. üåªüñ§üåº

Multiplayer games are so stressful, I feel like I have to do well or else everyone else will get mad at me.",148,red_circle57,,0,,"Totally get where you're coming from! I'm also primarily a single-player gamer and there's absolutely nothing weird about it. Single-player games let you enjoy the experience at your own pace, immerse yourself in amazing stories, and not deal with the pressure or toxicity that can come with online gaming.

While multiplayer games can be fun with friends, they often feel like a competitive job rather than relaxation. Single-player games give you that peaceful space to explore, learn, and enjoy without judgment. Some of my most memorable gaming experiences have been solo adventures like Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3.

Don't let anyone make you feel bad about your gaming preferences. There are millions of single-player gamers out there who feel the same way. Gaming is about having fun and unwinding - if multiplayer stresses you out, there's zero reason to force yourself into that scene. Keep enjoying what makes YOU happy!","

O.o,82,Eye_For_An_Ego,"I totally get this - being an emotional sponge is exhausting, especially when you're caught between two people you care about. It's like being stuck in the middle of an emotional thunderstorm that you can't control.

Have you heard of the term ""empath burnout""? It's when highly empathetic people get overwhelmed from absorbing others' emotions. What's helped me is creating emotional boundaries - reminding myself that I can acknowledge others' feelings without taking them on as my own. Your home should be your sanctuary, not a battlefield.

Maybe try creating some ""emotional safe zones"" for yourself? Like, making your bedroom a complete drama-free zone, or scheduling some time to get out of the house regularly - even if it's just going for a walk or sitting in a caf√©. It's not selfish to protect your own peace.

Remember, you're not responsible for fixing their relationship or managing their happiness. It's okay to step back and take care of yourself first. Sending you good vibes - this is a tough situation to be in. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I found starting my morning with stretching and a meditation/mindfulness exercise to be really helpful in grounding myself and keeping from having a total freak out. It takes practice to redirect your thoughts like that but it can be a very powerful tool in combination with medication.",184,AriaToaster,Aaah shit. And it's ALWAYS the worst.,16,MocMasterYT,"Yes, morning anxiety is definitely a real thing and you're not alone! I dealt with this for years - that pit in your stomach when you first become fully awake and your mind starts racing about the day ahead. It's great that you're seeing some improvement with medication.

A few things that helped me manage morning anxiety:
- Getting up at the first alarm instead of snoozing (the anticipation makes it worse)
- Having a simple morning routine that I can autopilot through
- Deep breathing exercises right when I wake up, before even getting out of bed
- Setting out clothes/items the night before to reduce morning decisions

Also, try to be gentle with yourself during this time. Your body's cortisol levels are naturally highest in the morning, which can amplify anxiety symptoms for some people. It's not your fault and it doesn't mean anything is wrong with you.

Stick with your treatment plan and maybe mention to your doctor that you're still experiencing morning symptoms specifically - they might have additional suggestions. Hang in there!","

Do you enjoy your job? I was suffering the same way last year in my job of five years, and it got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt sit through a 30 minute meeting without excusing myself to the bathroom to stave off a panic attack. There‚Äôs honestly nothing worse than feeling like every day is a battle against yourself. I finally took a few weeks annual leave and ended up taking off 3 months unpaid. I know not everyone has the luxury of being able to do so, and I was very lucky to be able to do this, but even a short break may help you reset a little bit. The time off helped me realise that work was behind a lot of my anxiety and I‚Äôm now transitioning into a new career path and feeling amazing about it. Of course I couldn‚Äôt have done all this without therapy. If it‚Äôs possible for you I definitely recommend taking some kind of break to rest, even a short one, and getting into therapy (if you‚Äôre not already). Hope this helps a little, and I really empathise with you and hope things get better üíï",8,yourfavambo,"I feel this so deeply. That constant internal screaming while maintaining a ""perfectly fine"" exterior is absolutely exhausting. You're basically performing an Oscar-worthy act every single day while your mind is in complete chaos - that takes a massive toll.

Have you considered talking to a therapist who specializes in anxiety? They can teach you specific coping techniques for managing work stress and panic attacks. In the meantime, even small things like taking 5-minute bathroom breaks to do deep breathing exercises or going for a quick walk during lunch can help create tiny moments of relief.

I know the ""just find another job"" advice isn't always realistic, but maybe you could start quietly looking around while working on managing the anxiety? Even having an escape plan in progress can sometimes make the current situation feel more bearable.

You're not alone in this. High-functioning anxiety is particularly brutal because people can't see how much you're struggling. But your feelings are valid, and you deserve support. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to.","

Yes,6,trippyearthling,"I totally get this - the ""lazy day guilt"" is so real, and it's frustrating how our bodies can seemingly punish us for trying to rest! Those physical symptoms sound really rough, especially the migraine and chest pain.

Here's what helped me: Instead of full bed days, I try to have ""gentle days"" where I still do some light movement - even just stretching or walking around the house a bit. Also, staying hydrated is huge (as you noticed!). Maybe keep a water bottle by the bed next time?

It sounds like your body and mind might be reacting to the sudden shift from being productive to complete rest. Sometimes anxiety kicks in when we feel like we ""should"" be doing something. Remember though - rest is productive too! You're recharging after a busy week, and that's important.

Next time, try setting a timer to get up every couple hours for water/stretching, and remind yourself that taking breaks is healthy and necessary. You deserve rest without the anxiety hangover!","

Having a panic attack on your first day must have been really scary, and it's completely understandable that you needed to step back and take some time for yourself.

You know what's really impressive? That you're listening to yourself and going at your own pace. There's no ""right"" timeline for education - what matters is that you're doing it when it feels right for YOU. Your academic achievements show you've got the smarts, and now you've given yourself time to build up the emotional readiness too.

A suggestion for when you start: Consider reaching out to your school's counseling services before classes begin. They can help you develop strategies for managing anxiety and create a support plan. Also, remember you don't have to tackle everything at once - it's totally okay to ease in with a lighter course load at first.

You've got this! Taking care of your mental health before jumping in was a mature decision, and that kind of self-awareness will serve you well in college.","

Anxiety can definitely cause dizziness even when you don't feel actively anxious - it's like your body stays in a heightened state even after the mental symptoms calm down.

Have you considered seeing a vestibular physical therapist? They specialize in balance issues and can often help identify the root cause. Also, keeping a symptom diary (noting when dizziness occurs, what you were doing, etc.) could help spot patterns.

Don't be afraid to get a second opinion if you're still concerned. While it's probably not anything serious, you deserve to feel confident about your health and find relief from these symptoms.","

POST TITLE: Does anyone ever feel like they are in a constant state of mild dizziness

POST BODY: I can feel dizzy when walking around my house without feeling anxious. I have had anxiety and dizziness at the same time but when I‚Äôm dizzy and not anxious it scares me. I have thought maybe I‚Äôm anxious without knowing and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm dizzy. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I have had high anxiety for almost a year and this is the after effects. I don‚Äôt really have health issues and my doctor doesn‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs necessary to do an mri on my brain because it‚Äôs very unlikely I have an issue in my brain.

Those late-night emotional spirals can be absolutely brutal, especially when you're feeling lonely. I've definitely been there.

Listen, I know you're probably exhausted, but try to resist the PS4 temptation right now. Even a short power nap before class might help you get through the day better than pulling a complete all-nighter. Set an alarm for 8:00 AM, grab a quick shower if you can, and maybe some caffeine.

When you have some time later, it might be worth looking into your school's counseling services. They usually offer free sessions and can help develop better strategies for dealing with those anxiety-filled nights. No pressure though - just something to consider.

Hang in there, and be gentle with yourself today. Sometimes just making it through is enough. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

There were also times that i even felt i was about to cry just by thinking those things. Can somebody please tell me what i am going through.,821,67,1570611647,"It's called Catastrophizing. I do it all the time and it's what broke my last relationship, as it made me depressed and anxious but it was my own head making up stuff that wasn't real. Or taking a scenario out of context and making it worse for myself when not the case.

For example yesterday my friends didn't sit with me at lunch. My head thought the worst, ""they probably hate me,"" ""they're embarrassed to sit with me"", ""they're fed up with the negativity you give off"" I made myself feel sick and couldn't finish my lunch.
My friend later messaged me saying she didn't see me at lunch and thought was I wasn't in the office, but no, I just sat slightly out of view. They just didn't see me.

If you can might be best to talk to someone about it or try some techniques to control your thoughts. It's not easy, trust me. But good luck.",124,blancheneige37,,0,,"I know exactly what you're describing - it's often called ""mental rehearsal"" or ""catastrophizing"" and it's actually really common! I do this too sometimes, where I'll play out entire arguments or scenarios in my head until they feel completely real and I'm genuinely upset by them.

What you're experiencing is your brain trying to ""prepare"" for potential situations, but sometimes it can spiral into unhelpful territory. The good news is that being aware of this pattern is the first step to managing it.

When you catch yourself doing this, try to:
- Pause and remind yourself ""This isn't real right now""
- Take a few deep breaths
- Ground yourself in the present moment by focusing on your surroundings
- Ask yourself ""Is this helpful thinking?""

If these thoughts are really impacting your daily life, talking to a therapist can be super helpful - they can teach you specific techniques to redirect these thought patterns.

You're not alone in this, and it doesn't make you weird or broken. It's just your mind being a bit overprotective of you! ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I do the same thing, just I can't help but scream ""fuck"" at the top of my lungs. 

My girlfriend is like ""what the fuck?"", Then I have to make up some bullshit of how I stubbed my toe or some other shit. 

Anyway, just to remind myself and you, that everyone you meet is the absolute center of their universe. I can tell you now, that whatever embarrassing shit you did, that memory for THEM is totally eclipsed by what you, and the people you were with were thinking of THEM. 

Everyone is so wrapped up in their own lives that they don't remember that stuff, just like YOU dont remember the embarrassing shit that someone ELSE did! 
There is someone, the same as you, sat there thinking ""oh shit! I hope u/throwawayhelpson99 don't remember that shit I did that time!""",65,Dr_BeefCake,"Hey there, I really feel for what you're going through. Those intrusive memories and the physical reactions you're describing - covering your face, screaming, the constant cringing - that sounds incredibly distressing and exhausting to deal with 24/7.

First, please know you're not alone in this. Many of us get stuck in these cycles of replaying embarrassing moments and beating ourselves up over past actions. It's a very human experience, even though it feels terrible.

Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? What you're describing sounds like it could be related to intrusive thoughts or anxiety, and there are actually specific techniques that can help manage these feelings. In the meantime, try to remember that you're probably the only one who remembers or cares about these past moments. We tend to be our own harshest critics.

When those thoughts hit, try grounding yourself in the present moment - focus on your breathing, name 5 things you can see right now, or put on some music. It won't fix everything, but it might help break that cycle of torment temporarily.

Hang in there. You deserve peace of mind, and this won't last forever.","

Nothing could have prepared me for that.",210,UncannyDreamz,,0,,"I completely understand these feelings. The frequency of mass shootings in the US is both heartbreaking and terrifying, and it's completely normal to feel anxious about it. That quote you saw is particularly disturbing - children should never be considered ""sacrifices"" for any political stance.

While it's natural to think about escape routes and safety plans (I do it too), try not to let these thoughts consume you. Consider talking to a therapist about managing this anxiety - it's a very real concern that many Americans struggle with.

What helps me is focusing on the positive actions we can take: getting involved in local advocacy groups, supporting organizations working for sensible gun reforms, and building stronger communities. These things help me feel less helpless.

Remember that while these tragic events make headlines, they shouldn't stop you from living your life. Your feelings are valid, but don't let fear win. Connect with others who share your concerns - you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.

I cannot stand being in a line or somewhere that draws attention and I *hate* feeling eyes on me.

That's actually a really big deal and you should be proud of yourself. Social anxiety is no joke, and that feeling of being watched or judged is totally real, even if others might not understand it.

I love that you discovered it wasn't nearly as scary as your mind made it out to be. That's usually how it goes with anxiety - our brains can turn simple tasks into these huge, scary scenarios. And you know what? Even if you had messed up, most people at gas stations are way too focused on their own stuff to even notice.

Don't let your husband's ""sheltered"" comment get to you. Everyone has different things they struggle with, and pushing through those struggles takes real courage. The fact that you did it AND found it empowering enough to switch to always pumping your own gas? That's awesome progress!

Keep challenging those anxious thoughts - each small victory makes the next one a little easier. üí™","

That awful spiral where anxiety makes you worry about your health, but the mental exhaustion makes it impossible to actually do the things that might help... and then you feel guilty for not doing them, which creates MORE anxiety. It's like being stuck in the world's most unfun merry-go-round.

Something that helped me was starting ridiculously small - like, literally just standing up and stretching for 30 seconds when I get anxious thoughts about not moving enough. No pressure to do a ""real"" workout. Sometimes that tiny bit of movement helps quiet the anxiety voice a little, and sometimes it leads to wanting to do a bit more. But even if all you do is that 30-second stretch, it's still better than nothing and you don't need to beat yourself up over it.

Be gentle with yourself. Mental exhaustion is real exhaustion, and anxiety is already putting your body through enough stress. You're doing your best to navigate a really tough situation. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It's actually pretty meaningful that they responded that way - it shows how much more awareness there is now about mental health among law enforcement. Just a few years ago, this situation might have gone very differently.

Don't beat yourself up about having an anxiety attack in that moment. These things can hit us at the most inconvenient times, and being questioned by police would make anyone's anxiety spike. The fact that you were able to communicate what was happening, even in that state, shows real strength.

Keep staying on top of your treatment and give those new meds time to work. Anxiety is tough, but it sounds like you're taking all the right steps to manage it.","

It's really frustrating when people treat anxiety like it's some kind of trendy personality trait while you're actually struggling with real anxiety attacks during class.

Your experience during math class sounds really tough. Have you talked to your school counselor or teachers about this? They might be able to help create accommodations or strategies to make those moments more manageable. Sometimes just having permission to step out of class when you need to can make a huge difference.

Try not to let others' casual attitudes about anxiety diminish your real experiences. What you're going through is valid, and it's okay to be frustrated. Focus on taking care of yourself and getting the support you need, regardless of how others talk about anxiety.","

And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted.

Remember that recovery isn't linear - some days will be better than others, and that's okay. You're not alone in this struggle, and there's nothing ""wrong"" with you for experiencing it.

Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

I often wondered if there is even a way to do that honestly. Like right now, I love going to my Dr. I know that sounds weird, but I feel safe and comfortable there. That is Friday, but to me it seems literally like Friday will never get here. It is just Tuesday and to me, the next 2 days are going to literally drag by no matter what I do to move them quicker. It just feels like days are turning into months and I am thinking this is something to do with my mild depression. 

I am starting work here soon, thinking that might calm some of it down. I was just wondering what you did to get out of the thought loop, because that feels like what I am going through. Keep up the good work and stay sober. Seven years in July free from opiates. Best decision I ever made in my life well other than leaving my ex husband. ",2,elasticheart1388,"Thank you for sharing your story - it's incredibly brave and could literally save someone else's life. As someone who has also struggled with depression, I know how rational those dark thoughts can seem in the moment. But you did the hardest and most important thing: you reached out for help.

It's amazing how clear things become when we remove alcohol from the equation. Depression and anxiety are hard enough to manage on their own without throwing a depressant into the mix. The fact that you recognized this, got professional help, and made such a dramatic change in 90 days is truly inspiring.

I'm especially glad you mentioned the automatic thoughts and thought loops - learning to recognize and break those patterns is such a crucial skill. You're doing the work, and it shows.

Enjoy your retreat - you've earned it. And thank you again for sharing this message of hope with others who might be struggling. Stories like yours remind us that change is possible, even when things feel hopeless.","

POST TITLE: 90 days.

POST BODY: Almost jumped 14 stories 90 days ago. Hungover, isolated, ashamed, totally hopeless. It was Christmas and I had zero will to live. Jumping made total rational sense. The end of all this pointless suffering. But I didn't. 

I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

Please, if you are suffering and drinking, give it a try. You have nothing to lose. I am going on a retreat tomorrow and I'll be on a flight for a bit, but I'll answer any questions and reply to all comments.

gpr8c6,Anxiety,Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day,FallUpJV,"For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that.

It's actually really common for people who've dealt with social anxiety to be especially sensitive to confrontation or harsh responses - our brains tend to replay these moments on loop.

While you acknowledge laughing wasn't ideal in that moment, their aggressive response was disproportionate and says more about them than you. A simple ""hey, this is actually serious"" would have sufficed.

Something that helps me with similar situations is reminding myself that most people's reactions are about their own stuff - maybe they were having a bad day or are dealing with something difficult. It doesn't make their behavior okay, but it helps take some of the personal sting out of it.

Have you tried any grounding techniques when these thoughts start spinning? Taking a few deep breaths and mentally listing things you can see/hear/feel can help break that anxiety cycle. Over time, practicing self-compassion and remembering that one awkward moment doesn't define you can make these situations easier to move past.","

As someone who has dealt with panic attacks, I know how absolutely exhausting and scary it can be when they're happening constantly. The fact that you took action by getting into therapy and working with a doctor on medication shows amazing strength.

Getting your weight back to a healthy level is huge too. Anxiety can wreak havoc on appetite and eating habits, so rebuilding that physical health alongside your mental health is really important.

Just remember that recovery isn't always linear - if you have a day with a panic attack in the future, it doesn't erase all this progress you've made. You've proven to yourself that you have the tools and strength to manage this. Keep celebrating these victories, no matter how small they might seem to others.

Wishing you many more panic-free weeks ahead! üí™","

hf4z51,Anxiety,"DAE get ""emotional build-up"" over time because of anxiety and the only solution is to cry it out?",[deleted],"I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for 19 years now. Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety. Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

‚Äê----------------------------------

EDIT: I'm really glad we all kind of took the opportunity to bond over something so stressful. It makes me happy that the anxiousness I felt yesterday opened the floor for us to talk candidly about what we experience. I hope everyone feels like they're not alone. I hope we all get to feeling better, or at least discovering new, healthy ways of coping with things. ‚ù§",795,86,1593018826,i do that too. i may not even notice the emotional build-up until i cry my eyes out. but its always refreshing.,73,darkywitch,,0,,"I totally get this. That build-up of anxiety is like slowly filling up a pressure cooker - eventually, it needs a release valve. Crying is actually a really healthy way to let it out, even though society sometimes makes us feel weird about it.

I do the same thing - bottle it up for weeks or months until I finally break down. Something that's helped me is scheduling regular ""emotional release"" time where I can just let myself cry without judgment. Sometimes I'll put on a sad movie or music as a trigger if I need to. It's better than waiting for it to explode randomly.

Don't apologize for ranting - this is exactly what these spaces are for. We all need somewhere to be real about this stuff. When you're in that anxious headspace, remember you're not alone in this experience. Many of us are right there with you, trying to navigate these same overwhelming feelings.

Take care of yourself, and cry whenever you need to. It's not weakness - it's your body and mind taking care of your emotional health. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

e45wza,Anxiety,Does anyone else shut down when being yelled at?,ChewTommy,"(M24) Whenever my mom is in a bad mood or pissed at someone or something. I feel like as if I have to walk on eggshells around her. If I take too long to do something or do it wrong she yells at me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love my mother to pieces but when she‚Äôs yelling at me my mind kind of shuts off, I can‚Äôt even think of a response and even if I do it never comes out right. I start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100. 

Then I get the usual thoughts of being useless, a failure etc. The rest of the day I feel like absolute garbage and I accomplish nothing other than laying in my bed. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Have you found a way to deal with it and not feel like trash?",805,76,1575157962,"This happened to me a lot, but that‚Äôs because I  grew up with a dad who has anger issues, so anytime someone yelled or argued with me I would be filled with anxiety and fear and spend the rest of the time thinking how everything is my fault and how much I hated myself. 

I still feel like this at times but i just distract myself with video games or something until I calm down and collect my thoughts. I reflect on what happened and the other person‚Äôs perspective and that usually clears the depressive thoughts away especially if I go back and have a conversation with that person.",121,twoluna,,0,,"This is a completely normal reaction - it's called the ""freeze"" response, and it's one of our basic stress reactions alongside fight or flight. I experience the same thing when faced with yelling, and it took me years to understand it wasn't a personal failure.

What you're describing (shutting down, stuttering, anxiety spike) is your nervous system's automatic response to perceived threat. The negative self-talk and depression afterward are also really common after these encounters.

A few things that helped me:
- Reminding myself that someone else's anger isn't always about me
- Learning to step away when possible (""I need a moment to collect my thoughts"")
- Working with a therapist to process these reactions
- Setting boundaries when possible, even small ones

You're not useless or a failure. Your brain is trying to protect you in the way it knows how. It might be worth having a calm conversation with your mom when things are good about how yelling affects you. If she's receptive, it could help both of you find better ways to communicate.

Stay strong, and remember that your reaction is valid. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I didn‚Äôt even know what to write down in the answer book, so it turned in to a long written explanation of why I hadn‚Äôt been to class and what was happening. I never saw the professor again after that final was turned in and I took a few years off of school to get myself together.

Later I felt so pressured that I just explained to him the truth in private. It just so happens people are PEOPLE. Haha, despite all the negativity on the internet, most folks are willing to extend a helping hand or show high levels of empathy when they see someone is truly struggling.

BTW, if you're in college/univeristy try to get formal accommodations. It's just a good way to track all of it, because not all professors will react with the same level of kindness. Also when it comes to job searching you have a paper trail to explain any sort of bad grades or whatever! Good luck!  ",13,[deleted],,"

As someone who has dealt with anxiety, I know how monumentally difficult that first step outside can be after being isolated for so long. The fact that you not only went for a walk but also managed to grocery shop is incredible progress.

You made a really important observation about how the anxiety started fading the longer you were out. That's exactly how exposure therapy works - your brain slowly learns that the situation isn't as threatening as it feels. You're absolutely right about needing to keep at it regularly. Each time you go out, it gets a tiny bit easier.

Don't feel bad about feeling anxious or awkward - you still did it, and that's what matters. You're building your confidence one step at a time. Maybe try setting small, manageable goals for yourself, like a 5-minute walk every other day, and slowly build up from there.

You should be really proud of yourself. This is a massive step forward, and you've proven to yourself that you can do hard things. Keep going! üí™","

POST BODY: wasn't easy but I managed to leave my apartment after 1 month of never stepping foot outside and it was nerve wrecking at first but the longer I stayed out I noticed my anxiety started to fade the more I walked. this is coming from someone with severe anxiety and agoraphobia.

I felt awkward and got anxious when I was at the cash register but I made it through.

n0n5fq,Anxiety,Why do people do this?,SnapesSocks,"I got made fun of today. I‚Äôm 42 years old and I got made fun of today. I was trying to get windshield wiper fluid on my way home with my very rambunctious and distracting 5 year old. I stood at the wrong register, because no one told me where I was being rung up and my kiddo was talking to me non stop. (For reference, the cash registers are only 2 feet away from each other.) When I saw that the total on the register in front of me was $3, I realized that wasn‚Äôt right and immediately turned to the other register that said $9 and paid that cashier. It was that simple. And I was so upbeat and friendly to them, outgoing even. On my way out the door with my kiddo, I overheard one cashier tell the other that I ‚Äúmust be stupid how could I not have noticed...‚Äù etc. the door closed. 

I‚Äôve got my anxiety mostly under control at this point in my life but it‚Äôs been a long battle. Something like this...guaranteed they‚Äôve already forgotten it, but it‚Äôs going to stick with me and rattle around in my brain, and make it harder for me the next time I need to go out and do something. And I also know that that‚Äôs all on me. 

But it would have taken nothing for her to say nothing or at least to wait until the door closed behind me. The way she did it was so offhand and uncharitable. Why do people do that?",777,100,1619639355,"in my experience working in service jobs, there‚Äôs a tendency to expect customers to act as if they are as familiar with the space as are the employees who work there every day. employees make fun of customers for minor misunderstandings and faux pas that are actually perfectly understandable. even knowing that, it‚Äôs hard not to take it personally, though. i‚Äôm sorry you had that experience.",389,user6733688544,"Honest answer: It's more about her than you.

I'm a lot more chilled out and compassionate now at age 36 than I was between the ages of puberty-23. For me age played into it, but some people never grow past it.

I already had a lot of issues, but my anger issues were the worst back then. When I worked a register it only took one bad customer for my mood to switch from feeling indifference towards customers into annoyance with or even sheer hatred for all of them, no matter how nice or friendly they might be. I hated my job. (Bad customer = screaming, yelling, doing everything in their power to ruin your day kind of bad.)

Though that kind of talk was reserved for the breakroom. I kept a professional customer service smile and attitude anywhere customers could hear, but I also have an explanation for why she didn't wait.

Sometimes it wasn't even about being aggravated or mad. Sometimes it was just a toxic form of bonding with my coworkers. They all complained about or mocked customers, so I did too. That's practically what the breakroom was for. She was apparently in rush to engage in that kind of bonding. I saw it happen more than once during my retail years.

It's terrible behavior, but it really does say more about her than you. She's an angry, bitter person who probably hates her job. You just had the misfortune of encountering her. Everyone gets distracted and makes simple mistakes sometimes. Her poor perspective on life doesn't mean anything bad about you. Please remember that.",122,TerminologyLacking,,"

Lurking in this sub has helped me cope with a lot of my insecurities and has helped me realise that i am not alone. So thank you all for that! 

To all of you, I also want to say that there is a way out of anxiety. You can get better, no matter which road you choose to do it through and it is definitely wort it! I really hope for you all that you will keep on fighting and come through all of your struggles. No matter if you think them small or overwhelming, struggle is a struggle, so keep on fighting that devil! 

Some advise from my therapist (psychiatrist) that might help some if you (it helped me a lot!) is to realise that worrying wont solve anything. Not that you should be able to control when your brain starts to worry, but if it starts, then don‚Äôt give it as much attention (i used to worry about everything and it drained all of energy). A point my therapist also made was that if two persons got in an accident, one who worries about such accident and one who doesn‚Äôt, the one who worries won‚Äôt be any more prepared than the one who don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs an incident, it‚Äôs a part of life. 
Getting to accepting that fact helped me through everything. I don‚Äôt say it will help
everyone, but i hope it will help some of you &lt;3 

Lots of love from me!

Edit: just to clarify about the term ‚Äúcured‚Äù. I lacked a better word, but maybe acceptance is a better substitute? Idk, but what i mean is that my anxiety no longer is an issue that i have to use so much energy on :) I know how to deal with it and don‚Äôt feel it anymore - and if it should come back tomorrow, in a week, a month, a year, a decade, i know how to deal with it ;) And if it comes, it comes. No amount worrying can ever prepare me for it, on the contrary!  :)

Idk, but what i mean is that my anxiety no longer is an issue that i have to use so much energy on :) I know how to deal with it and don‚Äôt feel it anymore - and if it should come back tomorrow, in a week, a month, a year, a decade, i know how to deal with it ;) And if it comes, it comes. No amount worrying can ever prepare me for it, on the contrary!  :)

Edit: It‚Äôs not time for me to leave the sub yet! I‚Äôm definitely staying! Great thanks to you all for the upvotes and rewards! 

Edit: please feel free to AMA about the process, i will try my best to answer the best i can!

Edit: typo

Edit: wow! Thanks kind strangers for all the upvotes and the awards! I‚Äôm just glad i can help! ;)

9kgj4s,Anxiety,Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.,Irarhet,"Every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control. Being able to understand, ""Hey, listen, you're having a panic attack,"" and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating.

When you feel these energies, which are overwhelming, observe them and let them pass as if you are detached from them and don't judge yourself for feeling this way because we all have (and are) feeling similar emotions  right now!!

n9nzjp,Anxiety,I battled my anxiety and got the Covid vaccine!,iheartrevolution,"I've spent most of the last 14 months inside, and my preexisting anxiety has gotten more intense. I've also had a previous anaphylactic reaction to a food allergy and most of my anxiety attacks have been regarding having a reaction to new foods or foods that are similar to what I know I am allergic to. Because of this, I have been extremely nervous about  getting vaccinated. I knew it was the right thing to do, and the way that the world gets better. I trust science and understand the facts that there's much more risk in long term Covid effects than negative effects from the vaccine. However, hearing allergic reactions to the vaccine being discussed and knowing that it's one of the issues they look out and prepare for has triggered my anxiety and made me afraid for when it was my turn.

I put it off much longer than I should have, but today I finally faced the fear and got through it. My experience was so positive. I found a local Buddhist university and knew that was the location I was meant to get it at. Everything went right, from the beginning. The parking attendant allowed us to pull right up and get the shot in our car even though the location recently went from drive through to walk up.

The nurse who stayed with me after was awesome and we spent the 30 minute wait talking about all the things I get to look forward to about entering the world again.

That gentleman looking me in the eyes and not just reassuring me, but in a way commanding me, to know I would be okay meant the world to me.

x5rqor,Anxiety,Why do you think boomers do not understand anxiety?,Bananabread4,"I keep reading posts where people vent about their parents not being understanding with anxiety (and other mental health) symptoms.

My parents do this as well. They think anxiety can be solved somehow, like when one has a migraine and they take something for it and it goes away. They look at me confused and perplexed while I explain them some of the symptoms.

k2vm53,Anxiety,Finally mustered up the courage and applied to grad school!,wrxcurls,"I graduated from undergrad about 5 years ago and never got a job in my field. I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn‚Äôt understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist. I finally did something that scared me, and even if it doesn't work out, at least now I can say that I tried and I gave it my all.",797,70,1606597355,"Very inspiring!

2. Attempt to start making some change by studying or job hunting, but immediately shut down and end up doing nothing and sleeping or finding a distraction instead.

acbd0s,Anxiety,Aced a phone interview and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,Queenbach,"Three years ago you would‚Äôve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I‚Äôd either pass the phone to my family, or I‚Äôd be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I‚Äôd blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn‚Äôt even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They‚Äôd be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could‚Äôve said better, the ways I could‚Äôve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn‚Äôt write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I‚Äôm hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I‚Äôm here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!",829,32,1546556147,Good job on the interview! Here's a upvote to celebrate,25,SomtimesDepressed,"I feel you. I had to call gamefly today to fix my account, it looked like my heart was about to grow legs and hop out. ",13,Shattered_Persona,,"

eq8lgh,Anxiety,I'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things,waterpanne,"You think I choose to feel this way? ""Just don't worry about it"" wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. Amazing advice, thanks.


I have some really bad fears that I can't get over and I am just at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore",778,83,1579304624,As if anxiety is a choice.,133,[deleted],"It sucks to hear people say that, but hey, it's a good gesture. Not everyone can sit down and explain exactly why your rationale isnt how you should be thinking about things. People most of the time understand that you won't stop worrying about things. As a person with hella anxiety, I tell people to not worry about things. Not cuz I think it'll stop their worrying, but because I know that it really is reassuring
