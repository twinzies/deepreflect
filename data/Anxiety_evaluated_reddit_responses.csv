But I can understand where these people are coming from and as yet another example of a child who had to take care of her mother, I just have to stand up for these people offering these words of caution. 

You've shared this story as a heartwarming, positive tale. And it is. Sort of. There's a lot of people commenting who are basically taking this as something to strive for in their relationships with their children, and that's the issue here. The people who are offering criticisms are just trying to make it loud and clear that while yes, it's sweet that your child offered you comfort, it's also a dangerous trend to set. I can't speak to how your child felt but I'd expect that most would feel a little scared by seeing their parent in such a state. You've made it very clear that you usually shield him from that, we've heard that loud and clear. 

But *in general* it should really be known that this is not a good road to go down. I really think that's all the naysayers are trying to get across, so please try not to take it as an attack.

5tm37a_14,5tm37a,top-comment,"I have heard this several times before and I just want to say this out loud for once rather than stifle it, let's call it an exercise in fighting my anxiety about how poorly it will be received.

I have epilepsy and anxiety.  I deal with both on a daily basis, they are both powerful beasts that can take similar forms but that are inherently distinctly different.  One key difference is this: anxiety is a cognitive function that can be harnessed and controlled; epilepsy is a biological process that, in most cases, cannot be halted through sheer willpower.  I view it like being trapped in a metal room - with anxiety, the door has heavy resistance and at times seems impossible to open; with epilepsy the same door is locked, barred and spot-welded shut.

Please don't get me wrong, anxiety can be crippling and is a severe widespread problem that should not be treated lightly.  My battles with both have been exhausting, but respectively very different.  These experiences have taught me one extremely important difference between the two:  anxious thoughts *must* must be faced to overcome anxiety, seizures do not have to be faced to overcome epilepsy.


To anyone out there with anxiety - you are not a victim, this sucks but you are not condemned to a life of these attacks/episodes.  You *can* pull yourself out of thought-spirals, overwhelming anxious thought, etc.  Maybe not this moment, maybe not next week or next year, but you can and with enough determination will do it.  Please don't compare yourself as someone who has a condition that can only really be managed with medication, it's not true and not fair to yourselves in your fight against anxiety.

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?"
7aimw8_46,7aimw8,top-comment,"I used to. Here's why it happens and how you can stop it.

The reason why is that you have trained your mind (and in reality, it has been trained by outside forces) to look at future events critically. If you're like me, you think of everything that can possibly go wrong when you go out, you think about hard it'll be, how tired you'll be. What if you miss the bus? What if there's traffic? What if the other person is late? What if what if what if.

What if is the poster child of the anxious thought. It can seem like a good idea, to prepare yourself for the next days tasks, but our problem is that we only ever think *negatively* about the next day.

But if doing things was ALWAYS negative, you wouldn't ever do things. 

So try this instead. Start to visualise what you need to do tomorrow entirely positively. Instead of thinking worst case, start to think best case. Imagine seeing your friend, and they're super happy to see you. Imagine the food you'll eat. Imagine the fresh air, blah blah. Just go through the next days task, imagining it entirely possible.

Anxiety and excitement feel quite similar when low level. So it's possible to reconfigure your mind to interpret that anxious feeling as just being excited for the next day.

After you complete the day, get some post it notes. Write three notes about the things you enjoyed that day, put em in a jar or something. 

Remember, anxiety occurs in your mind, and it colours your reality. But the same can be said for positive emotions. It's why so many people in life talk about it. If you start to think positively, your body will react as if something positive is happening. 

You can do it, you can cope, it's not too much for you! 

If you're still at a point where the anxiety is just too high to do this stuff, don't worry. You might need a little bit of CBT first, I found that helped me a huge amount. You might need to learn and practice some mindfulness techniques and meditation.

But it's entirely possible to rewrite your brain, so don't worry. If you keep going, keep trying, you can make it.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day?

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday.

Try not to let anxiety take over and stop you from doing something you want to do. The more you let it bar you from events and parties, the harder it will be to break out of that thought pattern.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT.

Going over it in your head can be therapeutic to an extent, but thinking about explaining your position and actually doing it are as different as thinking about your favourite food and eating it; both are good feelings but only one will actually help you out. So my advice would be not to worry about it or be ashamed of it- what you’re doing is perfectly normal, but at the same time if you want to really put your views out there then don’t be satisfied with your current habits because they won’t get you where you want to be. Overcoming confrontation difficulties can be incredibly hard but even the tiniest steps can feel far more rewarding than any crutch strategies for dealing with these situations after the fact.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?,"I'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because I'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. Am I just spineless or is this something that others feel?"

Clicking on their profile, they frequent /r/drugs and /r/blackmarket, including posting a picture of a pile of white powder on a scale.

I won't go into the politics of drug taking - people have different views and it's their body and all that. But I do feel we should stay vigilant of those who are trying to take advantage of people who are in a potentially desperate point in their lives where they could make rash decisions. "

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal.

If you’re like me, being around others can make you nervous, unless they’re very close to you. It takes a lot of energy to keep up acceptable social interaction.

If you’re comfortable talking about your anxiety, it can be surprisingly helpful to tell people you trust about this. It lessens the chance of hurt feelings, and it can be incredibly reassuring to have a friend look after your well-being. 

There are a few people these days that will ask where my energy is at before going out, and will offer to leave with me if I need to. That assurance alone is often enough to make me feel more relaxed.

You’re not broken. Your energy just has different parameters. Being social is draining.

",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.,"Every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope. Happiness/contentment does seem far away and even impossible at times, and in the case today, it led to nearly catastrophic panic attack today.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control. Being able to understand, ""Hey, listen, you're having a panic attack,"" and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating. I was able to stop the attack, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still under high anxiety right now.

It was a Trance Festival and everyone at Trance shows make me feel very comfortable. They are all so happy and Friendly. Easing myself into it. 

Ill leave you with this crazyness. And thank you a ton 

 Ive been having a reoccurring dream about going to the beach.. and I never get there. I can see the beach but something always happens keeping me from going to the beach. I like to dissect dreams... but I left this one alone because In reality.. ive been wanting to visit a real beach for a long time. I haven't been in years. So I though it was just a desire. 

I finally took the dream apart after I had a weird beach dream.. I found the beach in this dream and I fell to my knees to feel the sand and the sand turned into brown carpet. So i lifted up the carpet to look for the sand and there was another layer of carpet, I kept lifting up the layers of carpet (there were 3) and then there was this hole or window or something Where i could see the real beach and I became very upset because there were so many people on the beach that there was no place for me to sit and enjoy the peace and serenity. 

Anyway the dream ended up up being completely symbolic. The Beach is a Symbolic for the meeting place between my rational self (the Sand) and my emotional self (the water). The carpet was symbolic for the harsh realities of my life, the carpet being brown and dirty was symbolic for the foundation or comfort zone I have laid out for myself is no longer working for me and that I am refusing to confront issues in my life. Peeling up Carpet was symbolic that the way i view the world will be drastically changed and will specifically challenge my comfort zone. 

The sea specifically is symbolic for Emotional turbulence in my life and the everything that I worry about will resolve itself I overwhelm myself with my own emotions.. So I could see the resolution in my dreams.. but in this one.. the only thing keeping me from reaching that was all of the people I didnt want to be around. 
And what hit home for me here.. was the symbol of a crowded beach, It means that I seek company and a social life. It is the bridge that I need to cross to find the ocean.. My peace.. the meeting place between my rational and emotional mind. 
I am aware that Socializing is healthy.. and I used to at least try. Until I turned about 22 years old.. I spent the next two years avoiding people like the plague. Which is sad for me.. because I enjoy helping people, even if its out of blunt honesty and tons of people say I make them feel so good and happy Like I am a light in the dark.. but I just get so overwhelmed around them all. When I am not helping with problems..I dont know what to say. Advise comes easily out of my mouth.. but regular conversation.... no. there is no dictionary in my mind for that. 

Any way I thought it was a bit synchronistic that I was talking to you about trying to be social and then also got the message from my dream that Its time for me to try again. So thank you for contributing to that.

I am 26 and don't do anything fun. It's no wonder I am depressed. I never go to bars or clubs or have a group of friends to hangout with. I don't have any hobbies that'd help me meet people. I am doing nothing right towards socializing. I work and hang at home with my family. That's all i do. 

Who else is missing out on life and meeting people?"

a0k03f_621,a0k03f,op-engaged,Thanks!  I'm willing to try just about anything. ,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,A cool anxiety technique I learned,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!"

It's really about all pets/animals and is very sweet and soothing :)",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,I’m very grateful for my cat,"It’s 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share. "

I have a group chat on Facebook of Xbox friends I've become really close to over the last 2 years, to the point where we're like family in always having each others backs and being there for each other. Things have felt distant lately and whenever I say something that just gets read and no replies, I feel like I'm just bothering them all and being annoying. Doesn't help that my depression wants me to know that I'm worthless and everyone would be better off without me. 🤷‍♀️ Sigh.

",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,Aced a phone interview and I CAN’T STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,"Three years ago you would’ve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I’d either pass the phone to my family, or I’d be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I’d blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn’t even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They’d be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could’ve said better, the ways I could’ve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn’t write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I’m hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I’m here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!"

So glad you fought your way to get to where you are ,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,"This time last year I couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.","I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you.

1. Receive text/email. Feel some anxiety over what to say back so I put it off.
2. Put it off long enough that I feel that too much time has passed for me to answer without it being weird.
3. Experience mounting anxiety and my mental block grows as days go by without me answering.
4. Convince myself that the person who sent me the text/email in the first place now hates me and thinks of me as lazy/irresponsible/uncaring.

anwqai_936,anwqai,op-engaged,"This is one of the reasons why Anxiety is classified as a disorder. Those of us with anxiety and other things like depression and panic ect... it is caused by the inability for our brains to regulate chemical processes. So with anxiety and panic, our Amygdala is pretty fucked up. The amygdala is incharge of regulating norepinephrine ( the stress signal), dopamine, serotonin, Adrenalin and cortisol. When the Amygdala cant regulate properly it either, sends to much or not enough of these chemicals, and it never happens like clock work. One day we will get too much, then the next fived days not enough and the next 4 days not enough and the next too much ect... its not a perfect pattern.. if it was... we would probably be better able to adapt to our ""regular"" cycles. 

&amp;#x200B;

So With us.. we have to remember and learn about how our unique, malfunctioning brain works.. If you feel on top of the world for a day, after a long haul of feeling like shit, remember that you will experience a crash eventually, But Dont pout about it, its just biology, our brains and bodies are not used to the amount of dopamine and serotonin production that the amygdala is giving off that day or week that we feel on top of the world, This will result in a crash, where we feel tired,and it will probably go back to producing to much cortisol, which is what happens when normal people are tired. Tired people are stressed and depressed. It is an annoying vicious cycle, i do not wish upon anyone, but what really helped me was being able to listen and know my body... 

On those days that you feel high in the sky, observe what is happening, and observe that fact that you are not used to it, so you will crash, and you must enjoy the ride. Be prepared for the next days to come.

It sucks, but it is not a hopeless cause. If you really try, you can help calm the shit out of your own brain. I have done it. I will never be completely cured of  depression or anxiety, Everyone feels anxious  and depressed at times because this is natural, what you want to cure is the anxiety or depression you feel when you cannot think of a reason why. Once you have done that, You can move onto curing more specific things like social anxiety, chronic stress, activities or memories that give you depression or anxiety.

I wont put all of the specifics, because if you want to help yourself you are going to look up each of these things.  ( I am putting the ones that I have tried that worked at the top) Things to help you heal your amygdala are:

atleast 15- 20 minuets of sunlight per day

Meditate and stretch. ( yoga or not stretch your body) 

Diet change ( their are specific foods that do not help and can even cause depression and stress, its not the food specifically that causes it, it is what that food does to the body which domino effects to your brain. You basically have a brain in your stomach, many people call the stomach ""the second brain"" when in fact it should be the first brain, your stomach has a larger neural network then the brains in our head do, so when you are choosing food to eat, remember that what you feed your belly, you are feeding to your brain.)

Good nights sleep

10 min nap in the middle of the day

Water- Drink it, Swim, take baths, showers, put your feet in it or watch it. Water is therapeutic.

Switching up your routine, ( or getting a routine, if you are like me that was not a thing before)

Get a hobby.

Exercise ( I hate working out, but what helped me was at that moment which I started to feel like shit, panic, anxious, depressed, I would walk it out, Even run up and down the stairs, when we are active our brains produce special chemicals that sort of override the stress hormones and lack of serotonin and dopamine) 

Getting a pet and\\or having plants in your house ( again if you like me and have trouble keeping plant alive, choose succulents. Plants bring good chi, especially if you dont go outside very much to be around plants, having them in the place where you are most often helps you ).

The best thing I ever did for myself  to heal Panic disorder and anxiety, that I never thought of until I started Cognitive behavioral Therapy ( on my own, no money required)  was when I learned that I need to insert my self into settings and situations that I would otherwise not, As in do shit that gives me anxiety. For example I am scared to death of heights, So I went free climbing with my boyfriend in a canyon, yes I did cry on the way down, and no I did not look down when I got to the top of the maybe 50 feet we climbed, but there was this weird thing that happened, where I felt like I could do that again, and thinking about what I did didnt bring me anxiety&gt; I repeatedly did this. I have social anxiety, and I inserted my self into social situations, slowly at first, but last weekend I stayed out of my room for an entire party my roomates had, there was NO retreating. I took a job in a city 20 mins away from house, which I have to drive through a snowy canyon to get too... Do I have driving anxiety anymore? Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my last drug I will prescribe you.

Change. Change up your life, like your day to day routine, change stuff. There was a study they did with school kids that showed when the kids change which side of the classroom they sit in every day it helps them learn better, Basically not changing where you sit, creates a sort of comfort and familiarity, lessening attention. When we change up our lives often, we crawl out of the comfort zone, things that were unfamiliar and anxiety ridden before, become more friendly to us. When we change things, we create more energy, we are tired less often, and less fatigue means less depression, less stress, less anxiety. 

Change your life, and you will really change your life. 

Take it slow, remember that you are human and humans are a mystery to this world. We are powerful machines, and Mind over Matter does exist. Do not fall into this preconceived notion that you have a problem that can only be fixed by medications and doctors.. most of the time, that is not true. Take the steps to help your self first, and if you really just cannot do it, then spend the money on a therapist.. But in all honesty, we are our own best therapists.

apyki0_943,apyki0,op-engaged,"From the second I saw the title of this post I felt a connection to it. I've thought that same thing countless times. ...now onto reading the rest of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had the worst day I've had in a while. Very similar to the situations you described. Just as I thought I was becoming pretty good at this adulting thing, it felt like I had reverted to being a little kid. Scared of making mistakes. Unable to control my behavior. It was an awful feeling. I'm glad it's over now, but like you, it's pretty fucking humiliating. And disappointing...you feel like you're getting your shit together and then everything just falls apart again one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what you can do. All I know of is just find some degree of peace tonight and start again tomorrow. I wonder, are you always so anxious that you get tearful? Or do you normally just feel bad but without crying?

&amp;#x200B;

Is feeling incompetent something that's been bothering you for a while now? Have you been comparing yourself to other people a lot more lately, like there's something to lose if you aren't the best (e.g. a new coworker that might perform better than you, a new mutual friend with your partner that might get new attention, hope that you could successfully achieve your goals if you don't do well at your current job now)? All of those things can stack up and it sounds like maybe you have a lot more behind your anxiety than usual since you're posting this.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm finding that my returning depression is making my anxiety a lot more crybaby-ish and prone to catastrophizing than usual.

Usually a lot of men can be quite technical, where they want to pinpoint the reason for anxiety and solve it.

In the end, you could explain anxiety, or any other disorder, by looking at genetical predisposition and environmental factors such as childhood experiences or drug use. But that doesn't help you.

I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I’m doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

b25lyk_1053,b25lyk,op-engaged,This is absolutely great. Thank you for sharing. Would you mind if I shared this to my Facebook support group?,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too","I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ❤️"

b2b1t3_1061,b2b1t3,top-comment,"I've recently become aware that I have an issue with competing noises or background noises.   They make me bonkers.  For example - if my kids are playing on a tablet and my husband has the TV on or if we're driving and listening to a podcast but someone is also trying to get to tell me something. Or if the baby starts crying while music is playing.    
Ugh.   ",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure. Do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?"

I have anxiety and mild depression as well, I get to where it feels like days turn into months. I feel like I can't get outside of my own head sometimes. I often wondered if there is even a way to do that honestly. Like right now, I love going to my Dr. I know that sounds weird, but I feel safe and comfortable there. That is Friday, but to me it seems literally like Friday will never get here. It is just Tuesday and to me, the next 2 days are going to literally drag by no matter what I do to move them quicker. It just feels like days are turning into months and I am thinking this is something to do with my mild depression.

First, I am shocked this post was upvoted so many times. And I truly believe it wasn’t upvoted because of the victory you had, but because you made a very stressed point about not wanting to hear anything about Jesus. 

It deeply... deeply saddens me, grieves me to see such repulsiveness to the lord on your part. Where you are willing or have the thought of leaving to your car to get away from him. Before you stop reading, and yes I am speaking directly to the original poster, please hear me out. 

What exactly did God do to you to cause you to be so repulsed by him? Don’t blame it on the hosts. Because I don’t think that’s what this is all about. 

God, Jesus Christ, didn’t do anything to you to cause you harm. He didn’t cause any of this world to act the way it does. Mankind, in all his “wisdom” fights tooth and nail against God because he thinks he knows better. And satan and his army of demons, work in the invisible world and heavenly places to seek out and destroy us. It is satan, not God who causes strife. 

If anything, you should be repulsed by CNN or any other news network for that matter, especially modern pop culture. It’s filled with the work of satan. 

Let me stress this again, God did not do anything to you to cause YOU to hate him. You hate him because you’ve been deceived. 

God has done EVERYTHING he could to save us from our sin. When he said, “it is finished,” on the cross, he meant it. Anyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved, our salvation is sealed in him. 

The fact is, in your current mindset and where your heart is, you are going to hell. Many are on that path. Many! The Bible says so. 

God loves us so much. You have NO IDEA how much he loves us. If you think for a second how hard this worldly life is, imagine how bad hell will be. With no second chances. And eternal separation from Jesus Christ, his love and his glory. 

Yes, I’m approaching this the classical hated way by so many who disbelieve by bringing hell into the equation. And I am standing my ground in this. Because that’s the final verdict for all who deny the one and ONLY living God. 

My intention is not to fear you into allowing the lord into your heart. My intention is to show you what’s on the line. God, is beyond good. He offers love like you’ve never experienced. Your family, husband, kids or no one else can even come close to the love Christ offers. He is a gracious, loving, merciful and forgiving God. He’s coming back soon. 

I would hate to see you continue to hold on to so much hate for him and be eternally separated in complete agony. Christ said there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth there. Is it really worth leaning on your own understanding for these things? Your own understanding will get you no where. 

I’m willing to sacrifice all of my karma to stress to you how wrong you are right now. And it’s out of love. 

Over 700 people upvoted this post and it goes to show just how far separated we are from Christ. It deeply saddens me. We all have our own choices to make. And mine right now is to scream at you as loud as I can and say go the other way. You won’t be let down. 

What hope is there for any of us to live a part from God? Honestly ask yourself this question. What really matters in your life a part from God? My belief is a part from God, nothing.... absolutely nothing matters in this life.  If God is not the head of our life, we are dust in the wind. 

I pray you come to Christ someday. You won’t be popular, people will hate you, you won’t be upvoted, you’ll be down voted because you speak in his name. But that’s ok. Jesus said the world hated him first and so we’ll be hated as well as a result.

Wake up people! Jesus is coming back soon. Don’t be deceived! The day of the lord is at hand! And I can’t wait for it. But in the meantime, I desperately want to see people on Christ’s side. Not their own  misdirected side. 

Out of love to all!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone &lt;3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on ""imagining you're elsewhere"" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :') 
EDIT #4: Close your eyes after you read all of it ;)"

Last night I finally slept after days of being awake even if it was only for a few hours then again today I had a small nap.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

Hold that boy close and never let him go.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it"

Here is a story of me and my anxiety last summer.

I was going through a really stressful time. My sleep was shit and I was sad all the time. I started noticing at some point that my stomach had started hurting all the time. I would get weird different types of stomach pains in different areas of my stomach. I would have diarrhea and nausea literally every morning.

I ended up going to the doctor. A lot. I visited time and time again, always complaining about my stomach. They would run blood tests, take samples of my poop and eventually they even took an ultrasound of my stomach. I was in constant pain all the time. Yet nothing was wrong. 

I even got one of those things with a camera shoved down my throat to check my stomach. Yet again, nothing wrong. I never found any relief in any of the doctors telling me I was ok.

I wasnt ok! I was feeling like shit. I went to the gas station one day to fill up, and there was a restaurant attached, so I decided to order a warm meal. I took one bite and suddenly it felt like my heart was about to burst. I ran to the bathroom and it felt like I couldnt breathe. 

I was having my first panic attack. I didnt know this at the time. I didn’t know what to do, so I drove home to see my mother. She was watering some plants and I just told her everything and how scared I was.

She looked at me and said what im experiencing is completely normal. She said everybody goes through anxiety at some part of their life. She then asked me if I was hungry. I said yeah sure.

Just half an hour ago I was sitting in a gas station bathroom crying and feeling like shit, but now I was eating normally. Actually I was eating like a madman lol.

Slowly, but surely I started to understand It was my anxiety causing all this. 

I got even more confirmation the next week when I went to my sisters and her husband. We went fishing and had a couple of beers afterwards. Didnt know I was dealing with anxiety at the time, bad idea to drink alcohol.

We all went to bed and I just couldnt sleep. My heart was beating out of my chest! It felt like my chest was going to explode. I called a taxi and went to the hospital. I complained about shortness of breath and my heart beating like crazy. Got everything checked up and the nurses said there is nothing wrong with me. I chatted with them for a while and one of them asked if I had ever experienced panic attacks. 

At that point I truly started realizing what I was dealing with. OP if you read all the way here, just know that what is happening is normal and part of the process. The pain you feel is real! The tools to combat, however, might be in your mind! 

A year later I’m still struggling with anxiety but everything regarding gastrointestinal issues I am able to process relatively well.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?,"I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious.

Another good metaphor that I like is imagining yourself on a bridge looking below at 3 different trains on 3 tracks. One train carries carts full of your thoughts, one carries your physical responses to those thoughts , and the last carries your urges to act( e. g escape the situation). The idea is to try stay on the bridge without getting involved with anything on the tracks. Just watch the trains pass and just notice.

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about!

Thanks for sharing this here - it will inspire a lot of people.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,Hadn’t Left the house in four years update.,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best."

I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best."

I start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100.

Well done!",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
&gt;""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""  
- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship"

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

“does she actually give a shit about this?”

“you look stupid just stop”

the usual. 

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys."

I hope everything will go well for you!! Stay strong! ❤",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

f2ej20_2425,f2ej20,op-engaged,Congratulations,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!"

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?"

I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear.

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone &gt;&lt; Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here"

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem. This was my first time ever picking xanax and it was so scary but l got thorough it with your kind words and advice! Thank you all so much everyone who upvoted and replied :)."

g4y8e7_2806,g4y8e7,top-comment,"I really relate to this, I also was a ""gifted"" kid. Everything came easily to me until college.  I wasnt used to being challenged or having to actually study. On top of having had high expectations for myself, I developed anxiety and depression which fucked up my memory. Now, I feel like I cant learn anything let alone want to. I failed all of my college courses and I dropped out, because I couldnt handle the pressue. I feel like a complete failure.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity","I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?"

A wise person once told me it is ok to feel down, angry, and whatever we classify as ""negative emotions"" - let them go through you but the point is to not hold them for too long to the point it becomes heavy and impedes you from living your best life. When you feel these energies, which are overwhelming, observe them and let them pass as if you are detached from them and don't judge yourself for feeling this way because we all have (and are) feeling similar emotions  right now!!

 But I saw this documentary about HAPPINESS and it was about who the happiest people in the world seem to be.

Simple life living, no bullshit societal stipulations that f\*\*\* with your head…. just the sound of a breeze, the crashing of waves, and the beautiful sunny landscape filled with the stillness of nature. 

Maybe no one relates to this. 

Maybe this is just wishful thinking. 

Maybe it’s just the concept of “if I’m going to feel like hell, I might as well feel it in an absolutely breathtaking place where things are just a lot more chill and peaceful."

It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)"

This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

gms6fi_2969,gms6fi,top-comment,I’m in a really weird place right now where my anxiety is actually better than it’s been in years because I don’t have the stressors in my life that I usually do. It’s weird to be in a place of feeling pretty good when most of my peer have never felt worse mentally,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Does anyone that has dealt with depression /anxiety pre Covid19 feel even more out-of-sync with their peers even tho “everyone” is struggling with mental health, sadness and anxiety?","I’m just trying to figure out if it’s just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I’ve been there so long).

I just don’t know how to relate I guess."

gnfhvp_2976,gnfhvp,top-comment,"This is so spot on for me. I have severe anxiety and I struggle with the simplest of tasks. Mopping the floor can take me a month because I’ll put it off til the next morning. Then the evening. Rinse repeat.

I can put off shopping until my cupboards are bare and sometimes go through withdrawal because I can’t do something as simple as refill a repeat prescription.

An interaction on one of my posts today had me realise that the more I ruminate over tasks, the more daunting they become. 

One of the household chores I never seem to struggle with for example, has always been the dishes. Because it’s never been something I’ve put on my mental to do list. I tend to wash a couple of dishes while I’m waiting for the kettle to boil or waiting for the microwave to ping etc etc and they just get done. 

But mopping the floor becomes an impossible task because I overthink it. “I can’t just mop the floor. I’ve gotta sweep first. Then I have to pick up all the stuff on the floor. Then I’ve gotta make up the bucket etc etc etc. Oh and there’s no point having a clean floor if the stove is dirty. So I have to clean that first and then the wall tiles are gonna look weird if the floor is all shiny. So I’ll have to clean those too... then the windows will need doing. Eh. There’s no time for all that now” then I’ve made it into a whole thing.

You might already know that anxiety is caused by our fight/flight reflex, aka how our body protects itself from a threat. The main point is that its purely an animalistic response left over from when we were apes - upon seeing a bear, our bodies give us a hit of adrenaline which causes higher heart rate, breathing fast, shaking, to gives us more strength to run away or fight. But it isnt always as obvious as this. 

You probably felt embarrassed, and thats a hard emotion to deal with as humans, it can be isolating and we are very much pack animals, no matter how introverted someone is, because for our ape ancestors, embarrassment is our response to being isolated or ganged up on. This could be bad for survival -Imagine a pack of wolves, all of the same age and status within the pack, maybe theyre all litter mates or something (this is you and your friends). One of you has just killed a deer for the group to eat, and as their canine social norms dictate, the one who brought it gets the first go eating. (this is the person telling the story). You absentmindedly forget this, and reach to take a bite (laugh). You're not being malicious, but its a social mistake, and the wolf who killed it growls at you to get back.

gq9gsh_3008,gq9gsh,op-engaged,"I can absolutely relate to this. In my case, I often felt very overwhelmed because of the number of tasks in front of me, so every little bits of motivation ended up being suppressed by my anxiety.

I saw a therapist for a bit, and one thing she said really stuck with me: ""Actions precedes emotions."" Essentially, nobody has ever felt anything positive about tasks to come. You really need to give yourself a good kick in the butt to get started. Super hard at first, but after a while I find that you manage to do it more and more, and it can be really satisfying. 

So I guess you could try to ignore those feelings and get started, and see where it gets you. It's a journey, sometimes it feels being proactive, sometimes it feels like it's the last thing you want to do. One thing's for sure though, it's that it gets easier.

I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent.

Also doing something I’m bad at (for me, starting ballet again) has been helpful in that case bc I make a LOT of mistakes and get critiqued by my teacher, but it’s been pushing me to accept that I will never be perfect, and criticism is inevitable, but if I do my best i will be proud of myself.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh."

gxkn4w_3088,gxkn4w,op-engaged,"Hey, man. I get it. I deactivated all of my social media except youtube and reddit, but cleaned up youtube and reddit so I don’t have to see or hear about current events or my friends’/loved ones’ shitty opinions on current events. I also deleted all my news apps except for My Radar so I can get the weather without everything else.

Still, I’m extremely stressed out. For this whole week (since Saturday evening), my heart has been racing between 120-160 bpm. I’ve been feeling cold and in need of a thick hoodie and fluffy socks, even though it’s been between 80-90 degrees F this whole week. I haven’t slept or eaten. Only tonight have I been able to eat a small meal and a snack. I’m stuck in a loop of endless “what-ifs” and worst case scenarios. It sucks. It really fucking sucks. And, I’m sorry you’re going through the same.

I hope it’s comforting to know that you are far from alone. I know people who never understood what it was like to be anxious until now, when recent events have pushed them over the edge. My dad, perhaps the most stoic, level-headed, intelligent man I know, had a mental breakdown earlier this week and told me about it when I saw him Thursday, and opened up about my experiences. My mom has been a constant ball of anxiety. My grandparents have been full of anxiety. My friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc are full of anxiety. Everyone is losing their fucking minds. 

So, I think it’s wise to unplug, at least until the weather appears on the front page of the news sites again. I don’t think I’ll get back to social media shit. If I do, I’ll be coming back in a completely different way. 

It’s perfectly okay to unplug. It’s the most commendable thing you can do these days. Sure, some people may get upset at you. But, for the most part, it will be like you never existed online in the first place. So, take care of yourself. Don’t do what I did, and stay plugged in until you can’t eat or sleep for five days. Instead, surround yourself with positivity.

Beyond deactivating social media and ignoring the news, get back into a hobby or two. Listen to your favorite music. Work on some art. Read some good books. Listen to some uplifting podcasts. Watch interesting and funny movies. Go for long walks outside. Lift some weights. Learn new things about something you’ve always wanted to know more about. Talk to loved ones over the phone, over skype, and/or in person (if it’s possible). Get a therapist (if you don’t already have one). Do whatever you need to do to make it possible to heal.

Healing will take a long time. It won’t be easy. But, I promise it will get better! Keep on going! With time, you will heal, your friends and family will heal, society will heal, and everything will get back to normal.

2. Finding a game on your phone or YouTube videos on something you like that can distract you. Have a list of saved videos you can watch when you are feeling a panic. 

3. Ice pack. I put one on my neck or just hold it the sensation helps to calm. 

4. Staying hydrated. Drinking cold water when I’m feeling anxious also helps a little. 

5. Fresh air. If I’m too anxious for a walk I will sit on my balcony, and listen to music/ play a distracting game on my phone.

Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety. Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?"

I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

i2jiqh_3475,i2jiqh,top-comment,"Totally get what you mean, I had/have the same issue with feeling like aaaah why am I not creating/doing useful stuff/exercising/bettering myself every minute of every day! 

I personally think it’s super common in younger folk (don’t know if that applies to you) - we’ve grown up in an unstable economic situation, and we’re constantly reminded that our productivity and ability to make money define us and our futures. It’s an ingrained idea - and it’s obvious in the hustle/monetise your hobbies culture that’s so pervasive at the moment. 

That aside, being productive is great, but there are plenty of things that are equally or more valuable than being productive. Doing things you enjoy is definitely one of them! Taking time to unwind, destress, play video games, read, browse Reddit, whatever makes you happy, is a valuable and worthwhile use of your time. Is it productive? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I like to think that the ‘product’ is improved mental health, relaxation, happiness - maybe not as tangible as your work days, but arguably more important. 

It’s an easy thing to accept, but hard to put into practice (from my experience, anyway).

And then you feel guilty?,"This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can’t? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I’m literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren’t as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I’m late? 

I lay there like “oh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven’t even gotten up... what is the point?” and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I’m on my way there, my depression hits and I’m beating myself up because DUH, I’m awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t think this is normal? Can anyone relate or am I crazy?"

igkk32_3659,igkk32,top-comment,"So I""m still working on this, and I don't have a solid solution yet, but I can try to share what's worked for me. 

It all comes down to harm reduction and countering shame. I've been working (with the help of my therapist) on positive self-talk and not falling into the trap of shaming myself for ""wasting time"" because shame is not a motivator. It just makes me feel worse and I go online to avoid the negative feelings and the spiral intensifies. 

I've instead been focusing on harm reduction. I can't just stop ""wasting time"" all at once, but I can get better at focusing on the task at hand. I can try to push myself a little bit more each time and then acknowledge that. So instead of the negative self-talk of ""oh no you wasted 30 minutes"" it could be ""you spent only 30 minutes on Reddit this time as opposed to 45 and then you got focused again. How can we make that time to focus shorter?"" I'm been working on using timers for work and for breaks and trying not to be angry at myself when I forget to set them or follow them. 

It all boils down to self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself. And remember one more important detail: internalized capitalism is the worst. You have value irrespective of what you accomplish. You are not worthless because you haven't produced what you want or feel like you need to produce. You are not a robot and you are going to have days when you feel really productive and days when you need to just curl up into a ball and wait for the day to go by. What's important is to be able to tell the difference between the two.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,I’m so worried about wasting my time that I wind up wasting my time,"It sucks. I’m sure all of us have these days where we have a whole list of goals we want to accomplish but our time anxiety gets the best of us. 

I’ve tried doing the small goals approach, but I wind up feeling like I’m not doing enough. My lack of self motivation is so atrocious it’s a miracle I can wake up at normal times.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues? It sucks because I want to continue with my future but my complacency from anxiety and depression just wraps itself around me."

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be."

Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance’s nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of “Y’know I’m seeing that you’re a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don’t fly with me as a nurse.” This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real. After talking more he reluctantly suggested I go to the ED. I didn’t go immediately that night because the comments made made me feel like I was overreacting and that my need for care wasn’t important or a waste of time. I did go to the ED that afternoon around 3pm because my rash, itching, and fatigue were only getting worse. I was diagnosed with mites by the ER doctor and prescribed an anti-parasitic which has so far provided some relief. 

I’ve filed a grievance with my insurance because I feel like my dignity as a patient was violated and prevented me from seeking out care. At first I thought maybe this isn’t a big deal but after consulting with friends they said that this was unacceptable and that I should file a report. I’m kind of used to going to the doctor and having them brush things off as anxiety and it just seems like a vicious cycle cuz I never do anything about it because of my anxiety and not wanting to make it a big deal."

What I really wanted to suggest was maybe a cat door? That way you can keep your doors locked but still let kitty in and out.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn’t think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn’t see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn’t right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It’s so fucked up. I can’t describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn’t see my partner anymore. I didn’t have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don’t know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren’t the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I’ve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks.

I've been burglarized twice and robbed once (I was once burglarized because I frequently left my door slightly cracked for my cat!).  It's scary, and there's no way around that.  

Overall, it sounds like the situation went really well.  I would probably need to address my fears with a therapist, but please know that from what you wrote you reacted well -- in that in the end, no one got hurt.  I am sorry that you felt the very real fear when your parter went after them.  I may have felt more comfortable letting the stuff go than going after the culprits, which was riskier.  

This may be silly to say, but I didn't get burglarized again once I kept my door closed.  Also, generally, generally, generally speaking, burglars are often opportunists and do not want to actually hurt people.

So hearing anyone say otherwise is a strange feeling, just like you said in your post.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,anyone else get surprised when people genuinely like you and want to spend time with you?,"i almost always doubt someones intentions when they are talking to me. im always worried they think im weird or annoying, and that theyd rather be someplace else. and i almost always think when someone is being nice to me, that they are not being sincere. or when they are telling me something about themselves, they are lying to see if im ""stupid enough to believe it"" or something. i know its dumb and irrational. does anyone know how to let go of this doubtfulness, because im sick and tired of having nearly every conversation be like this. i just want to be able to socialise properly lol. to be honest i think this is less a social anxiety issue and more a self esteem issue but they kinda go hand in hand so"

Enjoy the animals, sounds like a wonderful job!",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Guys, not only did I get a decent job after not working for 4 years but I haven't called or been late yet after my first week!","Im a terrible flake when it comes to work. My anxiety goes up right before i go in and I end up getting sick and calling off or just not showing up. I'm a terribly unreliable worker.

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was.

The lady at Wendy's was really nice to me and gave me extra bacon and I almost cried. Made me feel motivated to try to live life more.,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,You are safe,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

Pass it on."

Then once I go to bed and try to sleep. All my fears come out of the woodwork. 

Slight head pain? Stroke.

Chest is tingling? Heart attack.

It goes on till 1 AM to 3 AM sometimes. I fall asleep once I’m exhausted of thinking and my body is just shutting down for the night.

I wake up. Happy. Care free. Zero anxiety.

I don’t think I’m some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say “oh well everyone has anxiety”. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say “thank you for telling me.”

Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside.

I'm going to make myself coffee and read every single one of your comments now."

jroy1r_4263,jroy1r,op-engaged,Do you have ADHD? I have always been anxious and depressed but I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. The psych said my strong aversion to loud noises is from that.,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)"
jroy1r_4265,jroy1r,top-comment,"I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I’m no sigmund freud but for me it’s definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I’m assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It’s only going to help.

I’m on the autistic spectrum and I have ADHD, I was forced to go to school despite me being severely depressed and I’m even more depressed now plus a fuckton of anxiety. Fuck school FR, who thought this is a good idea? I feel so trapped and I have no say in it, I have to do what others are forcing me to do and if not I’ll probably go to juvie (like really, if you don’t go to school here I think your parents can go to jail) . I’m always blamed for my problems too. I’m now in my last year of highschool and I doubt I’m gonna pass cause my head is already so overwhelmed with the depression and severe anxiety. My middle school literally kicked me out for being autistic and depressed. WHAT THE FUCK?? the school system sucks pretty much about everywhere, I’m certain we are not from the same country but it doesn’t matter because it’s shit pretty much everywhere you go. 
I don’t enjoy learning anything, in fact I don’t enjoy doing anything at all. FUCK. SCHOOL.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,"You turned me into this, FUCK school. FUCK school, FUCK school.

IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

PS: School and the education system can go burn in hell. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT OF THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO????? WE AREN'T SOME FUCKING RATS IN A LAB THAT YOU POKE AT. Im so frustrated....

It’s the busiest season for my niche-insurance market and I’m tired from working 45-50hr work weeks. My anxiety keeps me from taking off work knowing I’ll feel guilty for not helping the company when they need me the most. 

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for “outstanding attendance” which quickly made me realize I’m the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break. 

Anyways I took the day off to let someone else get that recognition for this month."

Ask people you trust about this. It’s scary, but it helps. Ask them if your voice sounds weird and tell them how you feel about wasting their time. I’m sure their answers will calm you down and make you more confident. You can use this to work on yourself and get better.

I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks.

I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn’t understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist. I finally did something that scared me, and even if it doesn't work out, at least now I can say that I tried and I gave it my all."

You are right, your mental health is yours and shouldn't appear on Internet without your consent.

I don't know in your country but in mine, your boss don't have the right to know why you're ill when you don't come at work because of privacy. So, if your job (where you pass the most of your time) don't have the right to know, I think your mom's friends don't need to know either. 

And there is a difference between telling that at some of her friends when she meet them or call them and post it on Facebook where a lot of people (and maybe not ""friends"") can see that.

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.” 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can’t go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won’t tolerate that shit. I’m not a minor any more, I’m a grown ass adult, and if I didn’t live in her house still she wouldn’t know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‘t feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.


I just want a break man, I‘m tired of feeling like dying over things that have many solutions to it.

It’s a trap, it feels like you’re gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you’re stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Again, you’re thinking about the most unlikely, worst case scenario. No, you’re not going to go crazy, you aren’t gonna have a heart attack, your life isn’t ruined forever, you’re intrusive thoughts won’t clog your mind forever.

This chest tightness, cloudy brain feeling won’t last forever, but it doesn’t go away by itself, you gotta put in the effort. Hope this helps!"

- Drinking herbal teas before bed

- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol

It has ruined my mood the whole weekend, I feel so nervous and down and on edge. 

I just want to call in sick forever and hide in bed...

😓 

I hate lying in bed at night wide awake worrying about the morning... I hate the feeling of worrying about not sleeping and it making the situation worse. 

Has anyone found a way to combat sinday blues / work anxiety after time off? 

Sending love to everyone else facing Monday...

*Edit: thank you everyone for your kind messages and replies. I love the phrase ""Sunday Scaries"", I'll be using that! 

I survived the night (barely)... horrible nights sleep. 

I think I will start trying meditation. Even though I am on medication that helps my anxiety,I have so much trouble switching my brain off at night. 

We can do it! 💙"

My first memories are anxiety, that fear, I feel it exactly the same as now.

But I wish, so bad that they had noticed it when I was young, that throwing up from anxiety when I had to interact with people as a kid isn't normal.

I feel like if I had a therapist or someone to help me when I was young things wouldn't have gotten this bad, that I wouldn't feel like I was stuck. I wouldn't be so isolated, I wouldn't have felt so alone my whole life.

If you have kids, and if you can, please get them some sort of therapy or counselling, even if they seem fine, I don't want anyone to grow up like I did, feeling crippled like this."

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger.

I responded ""ah, yeah, I've been meaning to do those but I work so late. I'll do them tomorrow morning."" She said ""seriously, I don't mind, let's do them together right now!"" and I replied ""NO!

It's not like any of it is inherently embarrassing either, which makes it very hard for me to justify acquiring muscle memory for Win + L / Win + D and waiting until the person walks out.

I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do."

Getting to accepting that fact helped me through everything. I don’t say it will help
everyone, but i hope it will help some of you &lt;3

Edit: just to clarify about the term “cured”. I lacked a better word, but maybe acceptance is a better substitute?

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people’s problems. that contributes to why i don’t open up. i’m always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven’t showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can’t bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don’t want to have a future &amp; i don’t feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren’t working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don’t believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can’t look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i’m scared that they’ll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren’t valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don’t compare other people’s problems to theirs. don’t minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. 🌻🖤🌼"

lcke3m_4936,lcke3m,op-engaged,"I have a large staff, and something that often catches my attention is when I want to check in with someone, first thing I often hear is ""Am I in trouble?"" Even when I've never coached or addressed something with this person ever - I have strong relationships with my staff, lots of positive feedback over the years, and still hear this.

Here's the message I've had to push the last few years to help - ""Adults don't get into trouble. Adults are held accountable for actions.""

And accountability is NOT punishment, sometimes accountability is just a n honest conversation about what happened, why and what the plan is to fix it, with no hard feelings, no malice, only a desire to encourage and growth. I used to feel like you do, and that's largely because my parents made ""getting into trouble"" A GIANT DEAL. Punishments were frankly beyond reason, and a source of trauma. Accountability is about speaking to and taking ownership of specific actions you've taken. ""messing up"" is something that mightve gotten me punished as a child, but as an adult, I am empowered to have a plan in place to fix it. 

You're not a kid (I think)  and other adults can't punish you like a child, and if they are, quit and find a place where you esteem and respect. Why? Cuz fuck em, that's why.  

My suggestion - reach out to your manager and request a weekly review or 1x1 of your performance - or even monthly biweekly, and explain that it's to make sure you have a clear understanding of performance and where you stand. This should really be a standard in offices, but it doesn't always happen. This can help you get clear understanding which should offer stability.

I just wanted to vent a little here. When it comes to messaging, I always feel like I've done something to offend my friends or something. Like, if they dont respond to my messages after a while, I start to feel like I did something wrong and now they hate me. Or whenever I call and they dont answer, I feel like they dont want to talk to me anymore. The obvious and logical answer is that they're busy, but anxiety doesn't give a fuck about logic. Right now, one of my friends hasn't messaged me back in about a week, and my anxiety just tells me stuff like, ""What if they're not busy and just ignoring me because they hate me."" That's my biggest anxiety problem right now. And then I start to get worried that I'm too clingy and that makes my anxiety worse, making me hate everything. Does anyone else get this, and if so, how do I fix it?"

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week.

I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals.

I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly.

I had constant nausea for sixteen years - always queasy at a minimum, often developing to the point of vomiting...sometimes for hours on end. It's awful. Thankfully it was the first symptom to disappear when I started my SSRI but for like half my life, man...and it often resembled the stomach flu, just endless hours in the bathroom in the middle of the night anxious to the point of sickness. Especially during finals in school, the week before and the week of. Not conducive towards being a productive human being. I once had to bail on most of my accounting final because the professor banned us from leaving the room for any reason and I suddenly *had* to go - I threw the exam on her desk and bolted from the room as fast as I could, barely made it in time. I've puked in my fair share of trash cans and bushes.

Peppermint or ginger tea can help. Anxious nausea is typically due to an overproduction of acid so antacids can help. For a portable option you can try Seabands, they're marketed for motion sickness but work pretty well for anxious nausea. And Tummydrops are good to keep in your pocket at all times - they come in ten flavors at varying intensities, you can get them on Amazon.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,Anyone else get horrible gastric problems from their anxiety?,"I already have IBS in my family (yay, me), but I’ve found that my anxiety makes my stomach problems so much worse.

mhlufw_5260,mhlufw,op-engaged,"Fortunately, this isn't a phenomenon that happens too much around this sub specifically but it's rampant elsewhere particularly from people selling snake oil and life coach ""anxiety is simple to fix"" mumbo jumbo. I have widespread brain damage resulting from an acquired brain injury (ABI), bilateral intraventricular brain hemorrhages as a very young child. Naturally, brain damage makes me high risk for all sorts of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. I seem to have ended up with a bunch of fear-related conditions - GAD, panic disorder, phobias, and trichotillomania which is a misguided attempt to cope and self-soothe. My therapist has been zero help for my GAD. CBT has been helpful for learning to cope with panic attacks and reduce my hair pulling, but not for GAD...when you're unreasonably anxious about everything and nothing and you know it but you can neither stop it nor ignore it, there's no rationalizing it away. Medication was the biggest help for my GAD, not therapy, the only thing that treats the root of the problem. Sometimes therapy and meditation and coping skills are just band-aids, they just treat the symptoms.

Going to a psychiatrist and starting meds was the best decision I ever made. Every person's experience is different, I can only share my own. The hardest thing about psychotropic medication is that it is usually not a quick fix, more like a scavenger hunt. You have to find the ""right"" medication for you, the one that works for you is unique to your disorder, genes and brain chemistry. If you take the wrong one, it may work but have intolerable side effects or may in fact actually make your anxiety worse even after the first few weeks of adjustment have passed (some only temporarily worsen anxiety, but that stops after a few weeks and then it improves past baseline).

I'd been in therapy for about nine months before I took the plunge and gone through two therapists. Both of my therapists were upfront with me after I'd been in treatment for a while, like ""in your case therapy is not likely to be sufficient"", they told me they could only be so helpful when anxiety is very severe. Does therapy help me manage my anxiety? Yes. Does it help me *stop* it? Hell no. I wanted my anxiety *gone* and that's not something CBT is capable of, that's not what it's designed to do. It just teaches you to cope with your illness.

Because of that, on therapy alone it's basically an endless, futile, fruitless fight between my coping skills and reframing and whatnot...and my brain. My anxiety has a *huge* impact on my functioning. Therapy, exercise, meditation, all those things have their place, but they also have their *limits*. It's not a panacea. None of that shit could stop the infinite storm of anxiety in my brain, the ruminating, the panic attacks, the nightmares and insomnia and compulsive hair pulling to the point of bleeding. Medication was the missing piece for me. I work at a mental health agency IRL so I don't have the fear of treatment and medication that some seem to. Medication and therapy combined are clinically proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety. Taking medication reduces your anxiety enough that you find that you are more receptive to therapeutic techniques, therapy becomes more useful and you're able to make more progress in therapy.

I take Citalopram/Celexa and it's magic. I have zero irrational anxiety - the sickening pit of dread is gone. I also take hydroxyzine for insomnia and for occasional panic attacks with success. Whatever is wrong with my brain that causes this intolerable anxiety and panic - Celexa fixes it. It's basically magic. Sometimes there's a biological cause, a difference in your brain, and medication gets to the root of the problem, and therapy and lifestyle changes only help manage the symptoms. 

Here's the thing about the side effects monster: for severe anxiety, you'd need some truly mad side effects to outweigh the benefits of the eradication of your anxiety. That's a *huge* benefit. *Most* ""side effects"" are more aptly named *adjustment effects* because they usually disappear by the end of the first month. You can handle that, you've lasted this long through insane anxiety, haven't you? For me, my adjustment effect was dry mouth. Big whoop. Nothing difficult there, gone like the wind by the end of the third week. Long-term, I have nothing more sinister on the three drugs I take than increased diarrhea which is no big deal whatsoever, because:

   A. I already had daily diarrhea anyway. It's 99% painless, merely annoying and an anxiety symptom regardless (as are most drug side effects), and 

   B. My anxiety was so severe that I'd have to have some truly gnarly, completely awful and intolerable side effects to make me even *consider* stopping...and none of the possible side effects of my drugs fall into that category. My SSRI has improved my life *exponentially.*

There are obviously people who have serious side effects and bad reactions, but drug manufacturers are legally obligated to report everything that everyone in trials *perceived* as ""side effects"", even if only three people out of 10,000 experienced it, and even if that 'side effect' may not have been related to the drug at all - just coincidentally happened while they were doing the drug trial, so therefore people's brains (hello, anxiety!) immediately jump to worst case ""oh shit, it's the drug!"". For a lot of those serious side effects (sexual side effects excluded), your chances of experiencing them is pretty damn low.

For online reviews, you're setting yourself up for failure from the start because it's like anything else; the happy people are not motivated to leave reviews, they're off living their lives, only the people who had bad experiences do, so it's skewed toward the negative. Often, people don't follow their medication regimen as they should: they mention that they start too high, they quit cold turkey, they skip doses, they take it on an empty stomach instead of with food, they stop after two days or two weeks and then complain it's the medication instead of user error. 

I've also seen my share of reviews that gave a bad rating not actually for any negative experience *on* the drug but because when they *stopped,* their anxiety came back and they were mad about it. No shit, Sherlock, what did you expect? You were feeling better *because* of the pills, why did you stop? 

It's like every other medical condition - you have a condition, you take medicine for it, symptoms go away. You stop taking medicine, symptoms come back. Anxiety. High blood pressure. Diabetes. Epilepsy. Arthritis. Everything. That is how medicine *works,* when nothing is there to hold back the tide of your condition, *obviously* it will come back and you'll experience symptoms again. You do still have to *work* to  control your medical condition, yes, like everyone else on the planet. 

Anyway, no amount of CBT in the world could do what Celexa does for me. The only problems I still have are my trichotillomania and uncontrollable nightmares, both of which have been my constant companion for sixteen years now. I have nightmares all night, every night, and wake up every 60-90 minutes usually in a cold sweat, shaking or crying, I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night, when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. I just recently had my very first good dreams in sixteen years and I suppose I can thank my Celexa for that (honestly a miracle), but before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Therapy was useless for it. I have found nothing to help. 

SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to work and for the first few weeks, Citalopram did nothing. Nothing good, nothing bad. And then all of a sudden one day it *worked*, I realized...I'm *calm*. I'd forgotten what that felt like. It had been sixteen years since I'd known that feeling. And I'm going on five months and that feeling has persisted. It's *beautiful.* I feel *normal.* I feel like *me* and I'd forgotten who that was, the person who isn't constantly hounded and crippled by anxiety and panic. I still get stressed in situations that would cause a normal, non-anxious person anxiety, but the constant, sickening pit of dread is gone thanks to my medication. I can't say enough good things about my experience with Celexa. The day I went to the psychiatrist for the first time is the best day of my life, no contest. 

I didn't think this was possible. Let me repeat that: I *work* at a mental health agency, and I was so far down the hole that there was no light. I'd been in therapy and while it helped with behavioral things, like coping with panic attacks and distracting myself, choosing behavioral alternatives to pulling my hair to self-sooth, therapy alone didn't and *couldn't* help as much as I wanted. It did nothing for my irrational, panicked brain - because that's just the nature of my brain, fundamentally. It's a disorder. I didn't know that *calm* was an achievable state for me anymore. I began therapy after a breakdown during a panic attack...I tried to amputate my fingers and realized there was no more denying it, this was obviously a disorder (turns out, a lot of them actually) and not an unfortunate assortment of flaws and personality quirks like I'd spent fifteen years desperately trying to convince myself. Starting medication was easily the best decision of my life and had a huge impact on my happiness, my functioning, every aspect of my life. I was constantly making myself sick with worry over the *stupidest* things, and even over absolutely nothing, and I knew it was stupid but I *couldn't stop*.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people.

But thankfully I've been kicking anxietys ass lately.   
CBD oil works for me to reduce my anxiety levels, or maybe that's wrong, it's more like ""muffle"" it, the anxiety is still there but I can't feel most of it. Then I started thinking that my gut bacteria had something to do with my anxiety, so I started drinking probiotic yoghurt which seemed to help a little.  Then one day I was listening to the Blindboy Podcast and he was talking about kambucha as a source of good bacteria, O. M. G. I tried it, and what a difference! Unlike the CBD, I feel the kambucha is actually helping reduce my anxiety, rather than just dulling it. I've only drank it 3 times in the past week, but I've seen a really big difference, I've halved the amount of CBD oil I've been taking and I'm able to exercise more. I'm quietly confident.     
So, given food calms your anxiety, try working to fix your gut bacteria and see if that helps.

mto6m2_5384,mto6m2,top-comment,"Agreed. The Flow philosophy, stoicism, and optimistic nihilism are some of the philosophies that help fight anxiety by directly contradicting and negating it. If you are willing to lose and willing to give up, there is nothing to torment you with. 

The moment you decide to take control and fight, wham bang, it's back. Float through life like a leaf on a river, seeing what life has to show without asking for anything, without yearning for safety.

I have spent an hour preparing. I have done breathing exercises to calm myself down and not cry. I prepared my bed for the ease of running away and hiding in it as soon as the phone call is done. I rehearsed my opening line and all possible outcomes. I considered just not calling, but told myself ""NO this is important, you can do this!""

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

And then they just... don't pick up.

n0n5fq_5444,n0n5fq,op-engaged,"Honest answer: It's more about her than you.

I'm a lot more chilled out and compassionate now at age 36 than I was between the ages of puberty-23. For me age played into it, but some people never grow past it.

I already had a lot of issues, but my anger issues were the worst back then. When I worked a register it only took one bad customer for my mood to switch from feeling indifference towards customers into annoyance with or even sheer hatred for all of them, no matter how nice or friendly they might be. I hated my job. (Bad customer = screaming, yelling, doing everything in their power to ruin your day kind of bad.)

Though that kind of talk was reserved for the breakroom. I kept a professional customer service smile and attitude anywhere customers could hear, but I also have an explanation for why she didn't wait.

Sometimes it wasn't even about being aggravated or mad. Sometimes it was just a toxic form of bonding with my coworkers. They all complained about or mocked customers, so I did too. That's practically what the breakroom was for. She was apparently in rush to engage in that kind of bonding. I saw it happen more than once during my retail years.

It's terrible behavior, but it really does say more about her than you. She's an angry, bitter person who probably hates her job. You just had the misfortune of encountering her. Everyone gets distracted and makes simple mistakes sometimes. Her poor perspective on life doesn't mean anything bad about you.

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes.

My car was totaled.","I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?"

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?"

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered?

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!"

n6ze4c_5502,n6ze4c,top-comment,"I think a lot of people just don't understand what anxiety/depression actually looks like and get overwhelmed when faced with it. I try not to blame them because it's something society doesn't talk about much and can be a lot. 

When someone exhibits ""normal"" levels of stress/worry/sadness it's easy to alleviate that person's pain with support and kind words and encouragement. Plus, there's usually a light at the end of the tunnel, an end point. Someone saying they are having anxiety over a presentation at work presents it and then the stress is done. That's what a lot of people think anxiety means both because we use that word flippantly and because its what people talk about when referring to ""anxiety"". (Please know I'm not saying these people don't have anxiety or can't feel overwhelmed, I am not gatekeeping the term, just that it's harmful when we use that term in only one way). 

Then here comes someone who says they are having anxiety and are in the bathroom for an hour, having trouble breathing, can't eat, can't get out of bed. And people are like whoa whoa whoa, this isn't anxiety, this has got to be some way worse mental health issue! Especially if it keeps happening!

I guess what I'm trying to say in a very long winded way is that we have turned the words 'anxiety' and 'depression' into meaning 'stressed' and 'sad'. People can deal with those emotions, there's a definitive end to those feelings. Most don't know what to do with someone having prolonged anxiety attacks. Which is why we need to more openly discuss mental health so more of us can be informed.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,"It's so frustrating when society wants to be all ""mental health awareness"" but when it comes to the actual symptoms of anxiety and other mental illnesses or being slightly low functioning, you're suddenly condemned for showing them","The company that I worked for: ""Hey it's mental health week!

nmx0ru_5628,nmx0ru,top-comment,"I struggled with this for a while too, until my therapist gave me a technique that completely relieved these thoughts for me.

Here's what she told me:

First, pick three or four characteristics that you would want people to describe you as. I chose supportive, kind, intelligent, and calm. Take your time and really reflect on what your ideal self would be like. Once you choose your words, think of these as your *objectives.* 

When you are socializing, all that is in your power is being the most \*your characteristics\* as you can. In your case, (I'll use my words for this example), you are afraid of reaching out to people, but if your message is kind, supportive, calm, and intelligent, then what more can you do? If you are being the best you can be, there is no reason to live up to other people's expectations of you. If they are actually bothered by you, then it is their issue, not yours. 

I personally struggled with replaying scenes of socializing with people in my head afterward, so I would use this to sort of grade myself - I would ask, ""was I as supportive as I could have been? How so?"" and then go through all of my characteristics.

I recommend putting little sticky notes around your house, or put a note on your phone to remind you of this. It took a little bit for me to actually accept that this is all that I can do, but now, I never worry about what other people think of me because I am simply trying to be the best version of myself, and if someone doesn't like that, then that is their burden, not mine, and it shouldn't be yours either.

I hope this helps :) and please ask for clarification if I didn't explain clearly enough!",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,I always feel like I'm bothering people,"Every time I think about messaging someone, I always think ""Will they think I'm annoying?"" or ""Do they really even care?""

I felt so humiliated I ran home taking a longer route to avoid walking past them again. I want to cry. I am going out for a work meal and now I feel like I am dressed too provocatively and every person is going to think I’m a slut. I am wearing trousers and a crop top because of the hot weather. My anxiety is through the roof, I just want to curl up in bed and never go outside again.

Edit: thank you all for such supportive and kind messages. It’s so nice to be reminded that the world isn’t full of horrible people. It made me cry how supportive you all are. Thank you for the suggestions that I should report these people, once my head is clear I will definitely do something about it. I don’t want anyone else to experience what I did."

I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder.

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me.

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay!

Look, I don’t care if you use weed. If it helps you, that’s great. It helps with your anxiety? Great.

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I’m already taking. I don’t want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that’s being sold on the street to get high. I’ve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don’t* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It’s just that it’s the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So… weed. Sure, it’s “more harmless” than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance — like medication, alcohol, food — can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don’t care if it’s fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It’s always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don’t want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I’m told it’s not “that bad”. Hell, I don’t want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me. 

Like I’ve said above, I know people generally mean well. But it starts getting annoying when they keep pushing for me to take weed, like it’s a panacea for my illnesses. I want to tell them: I’m glad it helps you, I am, but just because it works for you doesn’t mean it will work for me. If we exchange routines — you take my meds and I take weed — I’m sure you’d say an entirely different story.

I do not feel undeserving of love, yet I am clear with myself that it ain’t easy to be with me. I‘m not jealous, not needy etc, but like you said, I have anxiety when it comes to shopping, or going to get together and my bf has to go alone often because I prioritiese my mental health over being at these events. 

What I feel is that whenever I met someone in the past and the first love cloud blinds them, they say how they don’t mind, how it‘s not a Problem and they will never be annoyed by my anxiety and need to unwind alone more often than others - though I know better and tell them so (maybe I shouldn’t). And, surprise, after 6 to 9 months it starts to be a problem, maybe not one that gets said out loud a lot, but you feel if someone thinks „Why can‘t she be easy going, extroverted and social a bit more?“ 

It feels like partners start to try to change my after the first glow of being in love is over, and to me that means it isn’t love - the kind that you feel for someone unconditionally, take them as they are, as the person you met.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace."

I thought it was normal to constantly worry about whether my boyfriend (now husband) actually loved me.

The only thing that truly helped was medication. A daily med as well as a rescue med for anxiety attacks. The right meds and the right dosage made a world of difference for me. The vast majority of those thoughts stopped or were at least easier to manage. I'm currently off medication and doing well, but there is no shame in medication.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,"It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

(The man that flagged me down couldn’t speak good English and it was a busy road). I got out of my car and went over to the man. He was “snoring” but I knew that he wasn’t drunk he was actually overdosing. I asked how long he had been there and the man said over 30 minutes. I grabbed the phone and called the police. I told them someone was on the side of the road with visible powder up their nose and puke all over them. The operator instructed me to try to wake him up. I found a landscaper and ripped the gloves off of him and proceeded to try and wake the man up. The snoring was getting louder, I was told to start CPR.

I was flagged down by a man who said there was a guy “sleeping or drunk” on the side of the road and asked me to see if I could wake him up. (The man that flagged me down couldn’t speak good English and it was a busy road). I got out of my car and went over to the man. He was “snoring” but I knew that he wasn’t drunk he was actually overdosing. I asked how long he had been there and the man said over 30 minutes. I grabbed the phone and called the police. I told them someone was on the side of the road with visible powder up their nose and puke all over them. The operator instructed me to try to wake him up. I found a landscaper and ripped the gloves off of him and proceeded to try and wake the man up. The snoring was getting louder, I was told to start CPR.

Most ppl see stuff as just a kid being awkward or having to grow into the person they are and it doesn’t necessarily mean people didn’t care just that they didn’t recognize it and also that if you’re anxious you usually do a good job at hiding it, I know I lied my entire childhood it seemed to not feel so much anxiety with my family and friends.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me.

Couple weeks ago I was at a backyard movie night with some local friends. I'm not a big social person, and they know it, but either way I really don't have much a problem hanging out by myself or taking a break if I need. 

Anyhow.

One of the wives starts to chit chat with me, and is like *what have you been up to lately?* and honestly, the real answer is not much, working, exercising, riding my bike, walking the dog, that sort of thing, and she's like *come on throw me a bone, you have to be up to something new*, so I'm like *oh I am, I bought a jump rope the other day, and after struggling a bit I can do a couple reps of a hundred each without fucking up. You should try it, it's fun,* and that ended the conversation.

Later, I was really wondering if maybe she felt I was implying that she needed to exercise more, and it bugged me for a solid couple days. Really though, I feel like I'm pretty good at squashing that type of feeling, and generally it's just my brain being a pain in the ass, so I'm good, but it happens.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Does anyone else get anxious after interacting with people, because you felt maybe you acted weird/said something wrong","I have this really annoying habit that every time I hang out with friends / have talks with people, afterwards i start obsessing over every word that came out of my mouth.

I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future."

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile)

quvxse_6139,quvxse,op-engaged,Yep.  Everyday.

I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time."

And I’m utterly speechless. Today was the first time I met this doctor. I have had a nightmarish phase for the past 2 years. I have so many things going on and so much to lose. I told her my entire story and she patiently listened to me, until she broke down. 

Watching her, I couldn’t hold myself either. My eyes got misty and I tried my hardest to make sure she doesn’t see that I’m weeping too. As a 25 year old male, crying with her would have been embarrassing, that’s what I thought. 

I don’t really know what to make of it. She is a pretty well known psychiatrist with an MD and decades of experience. She patiently listened to me and prescribed me the meds that would help me battle anxiety and ADHD. She seemed really kind and compassionate, and the fact that she cried listening to my story made me realize how bad my situation really is.

THank you for reminding me I am not alone",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,What having Anxiety look like:,"No motivation. 
Isolating yourself. 
Listening music to escape from reality. 
Craving unhealthy food.
Pushing people you love away.
Biting nails.
Your leg shaking uncontrollable. 
Spill mascara. 
Shortness of breath.
Overthinking. 
Negative thinking. 
Sleep problems.
Sleeping  to escape from reality. 
Crying.
Disassociation. 

Having anxiety is probably one of the most lonely,  most isolating things to have. Because you are your own worst enemy.  And you live inside your head.

Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction"

I’ve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don’t understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

I’ve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can’t see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She’s doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

I’ve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don’t understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

Update: I want to thank every single one of you that has wrote something for me, it makes me feel so much better knowing someone took time out of their day to give advise or encouragement. As of right now I’m at my sisters house, it’s a lot better having an adult to talk to.

I’ve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can’t see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She’s doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

Thank you so much everyone you have helped me more than you know. Now the real work begins."

i had unprotected oral sex (recieved from a) with a friend (i told them to brush their teeth before) i'm an idiot. they may have had bleeding gums. after the session i took two showers/washed vigirously the effected area.

they have 0 history of hiv or stis/stds for the matter (according to them). and have had only had one partner. they hadn't been offically tested however.

should i be worried?

should i still reach out to my doctor?

i need help its consuming me this fear.

If this person had anxiety she'd be overwhelmed by the future and not the present.  Her post ebbs and flows into a cross between depression (putting herself down for past behavior) and anxiety (thinking about what she should do), further demonstrating her insecurities.
