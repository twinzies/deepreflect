z1mp8p,"AITAH for Wanting My Wife to Quit a Job She has where she has to live in another city, 3 weeks a month?","I am 49, my wife 41, we have been living together for 9 years, married for almost 2 years. 2 years ago, she got a great job, managing a high end retail store for a midsize company. I was very proud, and happy for her. She went to Europe for training for 7-9 days, and was doing great. She worked Mon-Friday. 10-6, and every other Saturday. We have a blended family, her son, 12 lives with us 24/7, his father is not  in his life. I have raised him since he was 4. My daughter, 15, from a previous marriage is with us one week, then with her mom, the next week.

We live in a beautiful neighborhood, lovely home, that I bought before our marriage. We have no mortgage, no car payments, no debt, so my wife doesn’t work to pay the mortgage, or to put food on the table.

9 months ago, her boss the regional manager quit, and the company offered my wife the job. I was so happy for her, and proud. I knew it would mean her traveling a lot, which I didn’t want, but I was more than willing to deal with it, so she could have an opportunity that I knew she deserved and would give her such pride, self esteem and validation. 

I knew she would travel a few days, maybe 5 days every few weeks.  That was January.

She was away for our 1 year anniversary, she was away for Valentines Day. 4-5 days turned in to 2 weeks. Then the NY store manger quit, and it turned in to her needing to be living in NY, (we live in Miami) until the end of the year. Coming back to Miami for a week, then back to NY. 

So I am at home, taking the kids to school, making lunch, dinner, grocery shopping, taking care of everything in our lives. I am a 49 year old married man, living alone. I am raising her child, my child, a household, dogs, a cat, a fish, tortoises, and paying for everything, except for the electric bill, her $100k a year job paid for the electric bill. And I am running a company with 20 employees and a $50,000 payroll ever month. 

She’s in NY, working and living the single life. And when she comes home, she’s just so busy with emails and meetings. 

It’s gotten to the point where I actually don’t care. I enjoy it. There aren’t any arguments, things run smoothly without someone else’s opinions and interference. 

I have overly expressed my frustration and unhappiness with the Situation, emphasizing the effects it has on her 12 year old son. He needs his mother, he deserves a mom in his life, because the real father she gave him doesn’t care. I love him, I am there for him, but I can’t do it all.

AITAH, because I want to SHARE a life with the woman I married, not be married to a woman that chooses to devote and prioritize her life, her time, my life and my time, to a job?

Please let me hear what I already know, but I am just avoiding?","NTA...but don't check out completely yet.

It's high time for the two of you to have an argument. Sit down when she is back for Thanksgiving and lay out clearly that the marriage is very close to over, and that you are on the brink of leaving. See if she's willing to make an effort to find a way to be more a part of this family, or if the marriage really IS over. 

There are probably 15 different scenarios that make things better...and yes, you might have to be willing to consider some changes as well to make this happen...the question is whether the two of you are willing to do what it takes for the relationship.

If not, you can at least part amicably.

People sometimes fall into lives that are not sustainable because they're so busy taking care of the next day that they forget how many days are passing.",NTA,"Why we always ask women to put there careers on hold, if this situation was different she wouldn't be thinking about asking you to quit, she would be thinking to make a plan so everything can work. Let me ask you have you talk to her about this? What are her response? She is not living the single life because she is not single, she has a husband and 2 kids, I read other comments saying directly divorce, I bet is because they can be with an independent women, you need to understand that you are a team and both of you have to make compromises. Not just talk to her, also listen, and this goes both ways.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're in a really challenging situation, feeling torn between supporting your wife's career and your desire for a more balanced family life. It's completely understandable to want to share your life with your partner and feel her presence in your shared responsibilities, especially when raising children. It seems like you deeply value the family unit and are carrying a lot on your shoulders. It's important to communicate these feelings openly with your wife, expressing both your pride in her career achievements and your need for her presence at home. 

You might consider discussing possible compromises or solutions together, such as exploring flexible work arrangements or setting specific times for family focus. It’s crucial to approach this conversation with empathy, acknowledging her ambitions while also conveying the impact her absence has on you and the children. Ultimately, striving for a balance that honors both of your needs and aspirations could lead to a more fulfilling partnership. Remember, expressing your truth doesn’t make you the antagonist; it’s about finding a path that works for both of you.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on your detailed situation, you're not being unreasonable at all. This isn't just about wanting your wife home - you're managing an entire household, raising two children (including her son), running your own business, and essentially living as a single parent while maintaining a marriage in name only.

While career growth is important, the current arrangement seems unsustainable for a healthy marriage and family life. The fact that you've started to prefer her absence because it's ""easier"" is a serious red flag that the relationship is suffering. This goes beyond just missing your wife - it's about the fundamental agreement of what marriage means to both of you.

You need to have an honest conversation with your wife about priorities and what you both want from this marriage. Given that finances aren't driving this decision (no debt, mortgage-free), it seems the job choice is purely about personal fulfillment - which is valid, but not at the complete expense of family life.

Consider seeking marriage counseling to help navigate this conversation, as it's clear both of you need to find a middle ground or make some difficult decisions about the future of your relationship.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're feeling deeply frustrated and lonely in this situation. On one hand, you initially supported your wife's career advancement, but the reality of her being away from home for extended periods has taken a toll on you and your family. It's understandable that you want to share a life with your wife and have her be present for your blended family, especially her son who needs a mother figure.

It's also clear that you've taken on a lot of responsibility in her absence, managing the household, caring for the children, and running your own business. It's no wonder you've grown accustomed to the independence and lack of conflict that comes with her being away.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings of frustration and unhappiness are valid. You're not just asking for your wife to quit her job; you're asking for her to prioritize your relationship and family. It's not about being selfish, but about having a mutual and balanced partnership.

I sense that you're struggling with guilt, wondering if you're being unreasonable or unfair to your wife's career aspirations. But it's crucial to remember that you're not asking her to choose between her career and your relationship; you're asking her to find a balance that works for both of you. It's time to have an honest and open conversation with your wife about your needs and desires, and to work together to find a solution that prioritizes your relationship and family.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy load and feeling squeezed on both ends—your own work, the kids, the home, and the distance that has become a routine. You’re not “AH”; you’re feeling exhausted, and that frustration is real. You’ve already expressed how the job’s demands affect the son and the household, and you’re right that a parent’s presence matters. The fact that you’re still willing to talk about it, to hear the other side, shows you care. Try framing the conversation around shared priorities: “I want us both to feel fulfilled and present. How can we balance her career growth with the family’s needs?” That opens a space for compromise without feeling like you’re judging her ambition. It’s not about choosing one over the other—it’s about finding a way to keep the team working together.",NO_VERDICT
x7hd5k,Not Sexually Attracted,"AITAH- 

Married 25 years with 3 kids.  Marriage has been up and down through the years, but sex has never been good (from my point of view).  Even when dating it was mediocre at best, but I only had one other person to compare.  

Last year she wanted to have sex and I really just didn't want to.  I got to the point where I didn't care if we ever had sex together again.  Obviously this has created a problem and she kept wanting to know what was my problem.  I wrestled with how to tell her, knowing that telling her would be a real blue to self esteem and could cause some damage .  After months of avoiding the topic, we got in an argument and I told her ""I'm just not attracted to you"" .  We have made some strides in talking about it and I alluded to the fact that she treats my family bad and she gained weight..... But I left out the lack of sexual chemistry. 

I feel like that would really kill her to know, but on the other hand I'm not being totally honest.  I figured it didn't matter of I said it, because it's not like you can change your chemistry, so I'm trying to save her feelings.  AITAH for not divulging this full information to her?","So you bring up her weight, her attitude, and blatantly tell her she is unattractive, which is all just fine. But you're afraid to mention the mediocre sex?

Dude


You suck.

This is a you problem. You aren't communicating. She has no idea what's going on. How is she supposed to fix anything if you don't talk to her about it?

YTA",YTA,"I think saying you’re not attracted to her is a big blow and quite harsh. Maybe she thinks the sex thing is under that umbrella? 
Maybe instead of blaming her for your lack of sex drive you could look at yourself and see what you could do differently? Women respond to love and care not criticism. Maybe you could suggest ways of doing things differently to spice things up? Share what would make things more exciting for you and encourage her to do the same. It’s rarely one persons ‘fault’ and it’s not fair to lay it all on her so to speak",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re in a difficult situation, trying to balance honesty with empathy for your partner's feelings. It's clear that you care about her and don't want to hurt her self-esteem, but you’re also grappling with your own needs and feelings. It’s important to acknowledge that sexual attraction can be a complex issue, and it’s not unusual for it to fluctuate over a long-term relationship. 

Consider approaching the conversation from a place of vulnerability and openness, focusing on how you both can work together to improve intimacy, rather than solely on attraction. It might be helpful to express your desire to strengthen your emotional and physical connection, which could naturally foster more chemistry between you. Seeking the guidance of a therapist might also provide a safe space for both of you to explore these feelings and find constructive paths forward. Remember, being honest doesn't mean being hurtful, and approaching the topic with sensitivity might help you find a resolution that respects both your feelings and hers.",NO_VERDICT,"I sense you're really struggling with balancing honesty and protecting your wife's feelings. It's clear you care about her emotional well-being, even as you grapple with these difficult feelings about your sexual relationship.

While you're trying to be kind by withholding the full truth about the chemistry issue, partial honesty in intimate relationships often creates its own problems. Your wife may sense there's more to the story, which could be causing additional anxiety or insecurity for her.

Instead of focusing on what can't be changed (chemistry), perhaps there's an opportunity to have a more constructive conversation about what could improve your intimate connection - both emotional and physical. This might include discussing what initially attracted you to each other, what makes you feel close now, and what behaviors or situations create distance.

Consider working with a marriage counselor who can help facilitate these sensitive discussions in a way that's both honest and constructive for your relationship. They can provide a safe space to explore these issues while maintaining respect and care for each other's feelings.",NO_VERDICT,"You sound like you're caught between being honest with your wife and protecting her feelings, particularly when it comes to the sensitive topic of sexual chemistry. On one hand, you've already shared some difficult truths with her, such as her weight gain and treatment of your family, which took a lot of courage.

However, by leaving out the part about lack of sexual chemistry, you're still holding back on the full truth. It's understandable that you want to spare her feelings, but it's also possible that not sharing this information might be depriving her of a deeper understanding of your situation.

It seems like you do care about your wife's feelings, but you're also struggling with how to be honest without causing more harm. Perhaps exploring why you feel like sharing this information would be so damaging might be helpful. Is it because you fear it would irreparably hurt her self-esteem, or is there something else at play?",NO_VERDICT,"It’s understandable you’re caught between protecting your wife’s feelings and wanting to be truthful. In a long marriage, the “sex” issue is often a symptom of deeper emotional disconnects—communication gaps, unmet needs, or different expectations. By withholding the lack of sexual chemistry, you’re giving her a partial story that may keep the real problem hidden, which can ultimately erode trust. Honesty here doesn’t have to be a blunt blow; it can be a compassionate conversation that frames the issue as a shared challenge rather than a personal failure. Suggest couples counseling or a sex therapist so you both can explore what you’re missing and whether intimacy can be rebuilt. You’re not an asshole for wanting to be kind, but withholding the core truth may keep both of you from healing.",NO_VERDICT
ybsk7w,AITA for giving my husband my ring back ?,"I'm  a 31 yr old female and my husband is a 32 yr old male. His relationship with his mom had been a major issue that I've spoken about here before. It was always clear he loved her more and tried to get me to be more like her. He told me with the 1 st year of marriage that he made a mistake marrying me bcuz I refused to wake up as early as she does to do Devotions in the mornings. 🙄 Anyway, I just wanna know for the sake of moving forward and being better in the future if I was TAH in one particular scenario.
We were in Church and she was being dramatic as usual...fake sniffling while talking to the congregation and inserting herself into the order of service where she was not supposed to be. I honestly hate how she always wants to be seen during the service. It's a small church and she just always has to get up from her seat even in the middle of service to go interrupt someone and say ""what God is telling her"". She even comes over me and grabs me by the shoulders or just stands behind me with her hands up ""praying for me"" whenever I'm speaking or singing as if I'm some kinda demon. She never does this when her son or her sister are speaking though. Anyway, I was visibly annoyed and my husband turned to me and said ""you can leave if you want to. I'm staying with mommy"". I was pissed and gave him my ring back and told him he can divorce me if he wants to and go be with his mother. (Not loudly nor close enough to anyone else) He cites that as one of the major things I did wrong in the marriage. Was I TAH ?","NTA

Oh HELL no! This man is not your man. He is his Mommas boy. And you will never be first.  That’s not a marriage. It’s so easy to manipulate people in church so you aren’t going to win there. Your best bet is to mention how a man is supposed to make a life with his wife. I believe the term is Cleave? Or something similar. So if anyone or SHE gives you any crap, quote that part of the Bible.",NTA,"NTA

From what you've described, it seems like you're feeling undervalued and overshadowed by his mother's presence and influence. Your decision to give your ring back might have been an emotional reaction to feeling unsupported and frustrated. It's understandable that you might feel hurt when your needs and feelings seem to be dismissed in favor of his mother's.

While giving the ring back could be seen as a drastic step, it's important to recognize that it might have been a way to express your deep dissatisfaction and call attention to an ongoing issue. It doesn't necessarily make you the ""bad guy""; it shows you're reaching a breaking point in seeking acknowledgment and respect in your marriage.

Consider discussing these feelings with your husband in a calm setting, focusing on how his actions make you feel rather than what his mother does. It might help to involve a counselor or mediator to facilitate a more constructive conversation. Communication and mutual respect are key in resolving such conflicts.",NO_VERDICT,"I can hear how deeply hurt and frustrated you are by this situation. Your reaction, while emotionally charged, came from a place of feeling consistently disrespected and secondary to your mother-in-law in your husband's life. His comment about ""staying with mommy"" in church was particularly dismissive of you as his wife.

However, returning the ring was a reactive gesture that, while understandable, may have escalated the situation rather than addressing the core issues. The real problem here isn't about a single moment in church - it's about your husband's ongoing failure to establish healthy boundaries with his mother and his apparent inability to prioritize his marriage.

You're not the asshole for feeling hurt and angry, but perhaps the ring gesture wasn't the most constructive way to handle it. This situation suggests a need for either serious marriage counseling or a careful evaluation of whether this relationship dynamic is sustainable for your well-being. A husband who openly states he regrets marrying you and consistently chooses his mother's side is showing concerning behavior that goes beyond this single incident.",NTA,"It sounds like you felt disrespected and belittled by your husband's comment, especially given the context of his mother's behavior and the dynamic you've described. Giving him your ring back in that moment might have been an impulsive reaction, but it also seems like a desperate attempt to convey the depth of your hurt and frustration.

It's understandable that you felt like your husband was choosing his mother over you, and his comment was a clear indicator of that. While the action itself might be seen as provocative, it's essential to consider the emotional context and the years of feelings you've been carrying about his relationship with his mother. 

It's not necessarily about being right or wrong; it's about understanding the emotional pain and desperation that led to your action.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of frustration and feeling invisible in a place that’s supposed to be supportive. You’re not automatically a “toxic asshole,” but the way you reacted—handing back a wedding ring and threatening divorce—was a very dramatic, high‑stakes move that escalated the conflict.

Your anger is understandable: you’re being interrupted, dismissed, and you feel your husband is siding with his mother over you. Still, the ring was a symbol of commitment, not a tool for a quick exit. A more constructive route would have been to pause, set a calm boundary (e.g., “I’m going to step out for a minute; let’s talk after the service”), and then discuss the pattern of your husband’s siding with his mom. If that doesn’t work, consider couples counseling or a neutral mediator.

In short: you weren’t a total asshole, but the dramatic gesture likely hurt the relationship more than it helped. Use this as a learning moment to find healthier ways to voice your needs and set boundaries.",NO_VERDICT
z10s11,AITA for choosing to spend Christmas with my ex foster carers instead of my family?,"To start off, Christmas has always been a bad time of year for me (19f). My grandmother is very judgemental if things don’t fit into her “perfect picture” and I feel like I have to preform anytime I’m around my family. I have recently moved into my own house with my 2yr old son Elliot after  living with my foster carers for 3 years. They have been there everyday since Elliot was born and are honorary grandparents. I speak to them everyday and they’re the first I call when I forget how to cook sausages lol. 

My family are pressuring me to spend Christmas with them but things always go wrong and I’m always the one that walks away crying. However when Christmas came around at my foster placement, there were no issues. Everyone was happy. Everyone was relaxed. Whereas things are always tense with my family. Everything has to be perfect. Everyone has to act perfect. And more often than not, I fall out with my sister (10f) and my mother always defends her. Favourite child stuff. I just want a peaceful Christmas, that’s all I want. 

When I told my mother I wanted to spend Christmas with my foster carers she immediately turned cold as she usually is and started guilt tripping me about how the family haven’t spent a single Christmas with Elliot yet. My mother has never liked how Elliot is closer to my foster carers than he is to her and I understand that but I don’t want to take that relationship between Elliot and my foster carers away. 

I talked to my aunt (mothers sister) about this and she told me not to stress about it, spend Christmas with whoever makes you happy. She understands how exhausting and mentally draining family events are. However I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong for choosing to spend Christmas with “people who got paid to look after me” (grandmothers words) instead of my actual family. 
So AITA?

[A little backstory and some more context]
I was placed in foster care at 12 after my abusive dad died. I was grieving for losing a dad but also relieved I was safe. My mother never stepped in to protect me. Grandmother turned a blind eye. I started acting out in my grief, running away, skipping school and having arguments with my mum. She wouldn’t send me to therapy and she couldn’t handle my outbursts so she put me in foster care. 

I got pregnant at 16 so I was moved to my AMAZING foster carers who could better facilitate a mother and child so me and Elliot could stay together. They have continued to support me even after having new placements in and I’ve been gone for 6 months. They’ve bought half the furniture for my house for me with no expectation to being paid back and they’ve always taken Elliot for the odd weekend whenever I’ve gotten a bit overwhelmed or needed a break. 

My Aunt has always been painted as the black sheep and as overdramatic as she has POTS and struggles to get out of bed a lot of days so she’s been very understanding of this and she actually acknowledges and talks to me about how traumatic my childhood was instead of sweeping it under the rug like everyone else in the family.","NTA. Your foster fam hasn't been paid in years to look after you. They are a major part of your life because they love you for you. They CHOOSE you. They have no responsibility to you, and yet they have stepped up in ways your bio family never has. 

When you become an adult you realize that you create your own family. Whether that's by having a partner and kids, or finding other people to join together. You have found a family who is not trying to change you, who has been there for you at some of your toughest times and haven't run away. Don't feel guilty for choosing the people who choose you.",NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you're navigating a challenging situation with a lot of emotional weight. Your desire for a peaceful and happy Christmas is entirely valid, especially considering your past experiences with your family. It's understandable to want to spend the holiday with people who have been supportive and nurturing, like your foster carers, who seem to have played a significant role in your and Elliot's lives. 

Your history suggests that your foster carers have provided the stability and kindness that perhaps were missing in your earlier years. It's natural that you'd want to maintain that positive environment for yourself and your son. Your aunt's advice about spending Christmas with those who make you happy is wise, as your mental well-being is important.

It's not wrong to prioritize your happiness and the well-being of your child. While family expectations can be difficult to manage, choosing a supportive and loving environment for Christmas doesn't make you the bad person. It's about creating a positive and nurturing space for you and Elliot.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on your story, you are absolutely not in the wrong here. Your foster carers have demonstrated consistent love, support, and understanding - creating the kind of nurturing environment that you and Elliot deserve, especially during the holidays. They've earned their place as your chosen family through actions, not just biological ties.

Your grandmother's dismissive comment about them being ""people who got paid to look after you"" reveals a lack of understanding about the deep bonds that can form in foster relationships. These carers have gone above and beyond, supporting you financially and emotionally even after your placement ended.

The contrast between the peaceful Christmases with your foster family versus the tense, performative ones with your biological family is telling. Your mother's guilt-tripping about Elliot, while ignoring her own past failures to protect and support you, shows she's more concerned about appearances than your wellbeing.

Choose the environment that brings you peace and joy. As your aunt wisely said, spend Christmas with those who make you happy. You're making a healthy choice for both yourself and your son.",NTA,"It sounds like you're caught in a difficult situation, torn between pleasing your family and doing what feels right for you and your son.

They've been a source of love, support, and stability in your life, especially during a time when you needed it most. It's clear that they've become like family to you and Elliot, and it's not about them being paid to care for you, but about the genuine bond you've formed.

It's also understandable that you'd want to avoid the tension and stress that comes with spending Christmas with your biological family. You deserve a peaceful and happy holiday season, and if that means spending it with people who make you feel loved and supported, then that's what you should do. Don't let guilt trips or criticism from your family make you feel otherwise. You're doing what's best for you and your son, and that's something to be proud of.",NTA,"It sounds like you’re navigating a very painful history while trying to create a safe, joyful holiday for yourself and Elliot. The foster carers have been a constant, loving presence for both of you, and the stress and judgment you feel from your grandmother’s “perfect picture” suggest that Christmas with family is a source of anxiety rather than comfort. Your mother’s guilt‑tripping, while hurtful, comes from a place of fear about losing a connection with her grandson, but that fear doesn’t override Elliot’s need for stability. AITA? No. You’re prioritizing your child’s emotional well‑being and your own mental health over a tradition that feels harmful. If you can, let your mother know the specific ways her expectations hurt you and ask for a compromise—perhaps a visit after the holidays. Until then, spending Christmas with the people who truly support you is a legitimate choice.",NTA
zye4zr,AITAH for letting my kid see my ex despite being in a new relationship,"I’m on a throwaway bc my man is on Reddit and there’s a lot of specific info here lmao. 

I’m 23F. I have a 4-year-old son, and for the past 6 months I’ve been seeing a man who I will call Chris (38M). About a year ago, I broke up with Matt (26M). I left my son’s father on very bad terms when I was pregnant, and was single for the next couple years while I got my proverbial shit in a pile. Matt was the first guy I ever dated since breaking up with my son’s father, and we went out for a little under a year and a half. While we dated, he forged a very close bond with my son, and they still spend time together. We broke up for good, though, because he got a girl in his masters program pregnant. This was devastating to me, but because he had a wonderful relationship with my son,  I didn’t want my son’s relationship with his only real father figure to just end overnight, so he still spends some time with Matt. I want to be an adult about this situation.  Matt wants my son to pop by this weekend so he can give him his Christmas present. 

Enter Chris. Chris has been dating me for 6 months now and I’m thinking about introducing him to my son, as I have a “6 month minimum.” Chris wanted to do it this weekend and, in a conversation about scheduling, I mentioned that my son would briefly stop by at my ex’s to get his present and see the baby. Chris was offended by this, because he said it indicated I was still emotionally enmeshed with my ex (I am not really on great terms with Matt right now, but try to put that aside). He said this was disrespectful to him and would teach my son “horrible lessons about women.” 

I’m trying to do the best job I can with everything.  AITAH?","NTA

From what you’ve shared, Chris’s reaction seems rooted in feeling sidelined rather than a moral judgment on your parenting. You’re still honoring your son’s connection to a positive male role model (Matt) while also wanting to introduce him to a partner you’re committed to. That’s a reasonable, adult approach. Chris’s comment about “horrible lessons” feels more like a defensive reaction than a fair critique of your situation.

z090f9,AITAH for not wanting my step parents I’m my life?,"Context needed but I 21M have had stepparents I’m my life since my actual parents divorced when I was 13. I was always told that they wouldn’t be interrupting my life during school and college, however that was a huge lie. Since they always said how I should do X,Y and Z or how I should and shouldn’t date a person they’ve never met because they had a partly shady past. Recently I’ve been dating my girlfriend who we’ll call A 21F. They’ve been saying when’s the wedding, when are we getting married, when are we going to see her etc etc. We’ve been dating 3 months and I know how much it’s affecting her putting pressure on her to make an appearance. Last week my parents were together at my younger sisters 19th birthday party, they wanted to know my A wasn’t here I politely said to both my step-mum and stepdad that A was working ( she works as a nurse at the city hospital). I don’t know what came over them but they demanded that I gave a better excuse and I was lying. I said that I wasn’t lying and that they are ruining my sisters day. They went on a rampage telling anyone who would listen that I was a compulsive liar and how I’ve ruined there lives. I snapped. I told them F Off and said how I was done with them and never wanted them in my life again, I then left the party. Since last week both my parents have tried calling and texting me on how I should give both my stepparents another chance. I have said no and stopped answering there text and calls. I feel bad for what I said I’m usually level headed but that tipped me over the edge should I give them another chance after giving them a million others. AITAH

Edit: a couple of people have noticed about the time length of my girlfriend relating to a post of which I asked for some advice a while ago. Well done those who realised and twigged on. Honestly I forgot about that post entirely and thought most of Reddit had. But I would like to mention me and my GF have been on and off for 7 months we had some issues at the start. I should have put that but in but I totally forgot about it until a couple of mentions on this post about it. Sorry for the miss communication all","NTA and you have every right to block them from your life. I would tell your bio parents that the only way they can see you from now on is without their obnoxious, overbearing spouses. Said obnoxious, overbearing spouses are not viewed as family. If bio parents want any involvement in your life going forward, including wedding and future grandchildren, they will learn to respect your boundaries. And, while you should not have to state it, their obnoxious, overbearing spouses will never have any role in the lives of any future family if you have one.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of boundary violations and pressure from your stepparents, which has built up over years. Your frustration is completely understandable. At 21, you have the right to manage your relationships and personal life without constant interference or accusations.

The fact that they publicly accused you of lying about your girlfriend's work schedule and tried to create drama at your sister's birthday party shows a concerning pattern of controlling behavior and disrespect for your boundaries. Your reaction, while heated, came after multiple attempts to handle things politely.

You're not the asshole for wanting space from people who repeatedly disregard your boundaries and create unnecessary conflict. While it's admirable that your parents want peace, they need to understand that reconciliation requires your stepparents to show genuine respect for your autonomy and boundaries.

It seems like you've been carrying this burden for a long time, and their behavior at your sister's birthday party was the final straw. You're not just reacting to the current situation, but also to all the past instances where they've overstepped boundaries.

y7e82q,AITAH For telling my mother my brother couldn’t move into my grans house so she should stop telling him he can,"I (21M) have lived with my grandparents since I was born. Nothing happened between my mother and I that I couldn’t stay with her I just never settled into her house when she moved out as I had spent the first 2 years of my life constantly spending time with my gran while my mother was at work.

My mother has more children but the main two are my brothers Jay (19M) and Harry (17M).

As I got older my gran informed me that my aunt and mother argued that when my uncle moved out either my cousin or Jay would move in. My cousin who is 15 used to be a bit of a trouble maker but has since calmed down. Whereas my brother has constantly been a trouble maker, he constantly starts arguments with Harry and myself, breaks his things and our things, talks back to our mother and since he’s moved in with his girlfriend every argument they get into they involve my mother and causes her stress.

Jay has lived with his girlfriend for a couple of months, he moved in with her around the same time our uncle finally moved out of my grans house.

When my uncle moved out my gran told me that her and my grandfather agreed I could have his room while keeping my room to turn one of the rooms into a mini living room as my bedroom was very small and cramped anytime I had friends over. Since then I’ve spent a lot of my own money decorating the room, I moved in my tv and bought myself a couch so that whenever I had friends over we had somewhere to sit.

Which brings me to the issue. A few weeks back my mother told my gran about how she told Jay that if him and his girlfriend break up he has to find his own apartment as the house has been a lot calmer since he moved out and that anytime he comes to visit he constantly starts arguments with Harry. She then told my gran that she told Jay that since she has the spare room he could just move in with us.

My gran explained that all my stuff was in the spare room and that we didn’t have a second bed. She told my mother that he could stay a night or two if he had to but she wasn’t having him stay constantly.

A few weeks later my mother mentions it again, she asked my gran why Jay can’t sleep on my sofa bed (I don’t own one) and when my gran explained this she asked why he couldn’t just sleep on the couch or why can’t I sleep on the couch and he can have my bed as I don’t need two rooms.

My gran explained that my couch wasn’t the biggest and that I paid for it myself so if Jay was to move in he wouldn’t have anything in the room as all my stuff would be moved into the one room.

A few days later my mother then asks me if I’d be willing to let Jay have my extra room and to leave my tv and couch in the room so he’s able to play his Xbox and have somewhere to sleep. I told her no as I paid for my tv and couch myself and I wasn’t going to inconvenience myself because she was refusing to let Jay move in. At this my mother called me selfish for not being willing to share with my brother and that with work and university I wouldn’t be using my tv and PlayStation as much so he should be allowed to have the spare room and use my things.

When I got home I told my gran all this. I asked if she told my mother he could move in to which she said no as she couldn’t handle or afford to keep him as my mother had him expecting to have everything replaced if he breaks it and doesn’t want to deal with his rudeness. She told me she repeatedly told my mother he wasn’t moving in which she is ignoring.

After this I texted my mother saying that my gran has already told her Jay isn’t moving in and that even if he was I wouldn’t give him my tv and stuff. She once again called me selfish and told me I didn’t deserve my stuff if I wasn’t willing to share with my brother.

I feel like an asshole but know he’d break my things and know my gran doesn’t want to deal with his attitude. So AITAH?","NTA

Your grandmother doesn't need that kind of stress, and your mom knows that, she's just hoping that she can trick you and your grandma into letting Jay stay there so she doesn't have to be bothered. The nonchalant way in which she expected you to just leave your expensive electronics available to be broken by your brother with the anger issues is telling.

From what you've described, it seems like your mother may not fully understand or respect the decision made by your grandparents and you regarding the living arrangements. You’ve communicated your stance clearly, and it seems like you’re trying to maintain peace by setting boundaries, which is important for your well-being.

It's not selfish to want to keep your space and belongings intact, especially if you've invested your own resources into them. Perhaps further open communication with your mother could help, emphasizing the reasons behind your decision, and reinforcing the fact that it's a collective family decision. You’re not the asshole for wanting to maintain your living space and the peace within your home.",NTA,"Based on the dialog example and situation described, here's my 150-word response:

You're not being an asshole here. You're actually being quite reasonable in protecting both your own boundaries and supporting your grandmother's decision. A few key points stand out:

1. Your grandmother has already clearly stated she doesn't want Jay moving in
2. You've invested your own money in creating your space
3. There's a documented history of Jay being disruptive and breaking things
4. Your mother is trying to override both you and your grandmother's boundaries

It seems your mother may be struggling to accept that she can't control this situation, and is trying to pressure both you and your grandmother into a solution that neither of you want. While sharing with siblings is generally good, this isn't a simple sharing situation - it's about respecting established boundaries and property rights.

Stay firm but kind in maintaining these boundaries. Your mother's frustration doesn't make you selfish or wrong.",NTA,"You're not the asshole in this situation. From what you've described, it's clear that your mother is being unreasonable and ignoring your grandmother's boundaries.

It's understandable that you're protecting your own space and possessions, especially since you've invested your own money into them. Your mother's reaction, calling you selfish, is unfair and dismissive of your feelings and concerns.

Your grandmother's concerns about Jay's behavior and the potential strain on her household are also valid. It's not selfish to prioritize your own needs and well-being, nor is it selfish to respect your grandmother's boundaries.

Your mother's expectation that you should be willing to give up your things and space for your brother's benefit is not only unfair but also sets a bad precedent.

At the same time, your mother’s frustration comes from a place of feeling stuck—she wants to keep the house calm but sees no other solution, so she’s looking for a quick fix.

You’re not automatically “selfish”; you’re simply setting a boundary. The key is to communicate that boundary calmly: “I’m happy to let Jay stay a night or two, but I can’t give up my couch and TV because they’re my personal items.” Suggest a compromise—maybe he can use a different room or a shared space you’re willing to sacrifice for a short period. If the house stays stressful, it might be worth looking into a temporary shared living arrangement outside the grandparents’ home. That way you keep your space and your mother’s peace.",NO_VERDICT
ycrzuu,AITAH for asking my ex to rent an apartment with a room for our daughter?,"We are newly separated, he is moving out soon. I hope!! All he is looking for are 1 bedroom apartment all included (appliances, sofa, tables etc.). Easy solution, thats true. That means he leaves me everything. Absolutely nothing fancy, old stuff we accumulated over the years. He gets to go in a new apt with everything brand new. Yes, i am feeling a bit jealous... 
BUT. My real problem is he is not providing our daughter with a room of her own. To me this a real basic, pragmatic thing to have. No? He says he never tought of that, that i am now throwing him a curveball, that he will never find such a thing, too expensive  yadiyadiyada.
True, the market is expensive. But it is for him and me, equally. 
We had a big fight about it. He blames me for everything. It was my decision to end our relationship, but i naively tought we could work it out like normal people do: ie share custody and coparent. 
But, he said that no, our daughter will be with me most of the time. Si i guess we will not be sharing custody after all. Not that i mind, i much prefer to have my daughter with me, its great. But I find it sad for her. 
Should i continue to insist he finds an apartment with 2 bedrooms? AITAH for asking for it? Should i let go?

EDIT. Thank all of you for your answers, keeping my ego in check and being concerned about my daughter well being. All your answers have given me a good spectrum on viewpoints and helped me tremendously. 
My ex and i have talked, and we came to an agreement. And, our daughter is happy and excited about his new place. The 1 bdr apt. 
Thanks, have a blessed day!","NTA...you were right to point that out to him. He gave his response. Now you know you get to keep your daughter.  Don't push him to get a 2 bedroom. Accept that he didn't envision his child in his life for probably more than a few hours a week. She's old enough to understand that, but you don't have to tell her that. Let him explain why he doesn't have room for her at HIS home. Her home is with you. Its so sad for her and I hope you do your best to be there for her and be sympathetic and understanding of any behaviors that follow this split. Get her therapy if she needs it to process all this. You'll be going through a lot yourself, but she is innocent in all this and has no say in the decisions her parents make that directly affect her. She has no control, so she may try to control other things in her life that may cause frustration for you.

You lost that right when the relationship ended. If your daughter is small than she doesn’t need a room. Let him get himself together since he’s leaving everything to you.

Wanting her to have her own space is a valid request, as it could help her feel more at ease during this transition. It's also natural to feel a mix of emotions, like jealousy or frustration, during such a significant change in your lives. However, it's essential to balance those feelings with the practical realities of both your and your ex's circumstances.

It seems like you've already taken a positive step by discussing the issue with your ex and reaching an agreement. It's encouraging to hear that your daughter is excited about her dad's new place, even if it's a one-bedroom apartment. This shows your willingness to communicate and find a resolution that works for everyone involved, which is crucial in co-parenting.

While wanting a separate room for her comes from a good place, it seems like there might be some mixed feelings about your ex's transition that are influencing this situation.

Given that he's indicated he won't have primary custody and considering the current housing market challenges, a one-bedroom apartment might be a practical starting point for him. Many children of divorced parents adapt well to simpler arrangements during visitation, especially in the beginning.

Instead of focusing on the apartment size, perhaps concentrate on making whatever space he has welcoming and comfortable for your daughter - even if it's a designated area in the living room. This could help maintain their relationship while he establishes himself independently.

Remember that living arrangements can evolve over time as circumstances change. The most important thing is maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship for your daughter's benefit. Consider letting go of this particular battle and focusing your energy on helping your daughter adjust to the new situation.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're struggling with a mix of emotions - concern for your daughter's well-being, jealousy about your ex's new life, and frustration about the custody situation. You care deeply about your daughter having a room of her own, and it's understandable that you want her to have that basic need met.

However, it's also important to consider your ex's perspective and the reality of the situation. He may genuinely be struggling to find a 2-bedroom apartment within his budget, and insisting on it could create more tension between you two. 

Rather than focusing on whether you're right or wrong in asking for a 2-bedroom apartment, perhaps you could try to have a more nuanced conversation with your ex about your concerns and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you. It might be helpful to explore alternative solutions, such as setting up a comfortable space for your daughter in a 1-bedroom apartment or establishing a regular routine for her to spend time at her dad's place.

What matters most is whether you can reach a clear, practical agreement that keeps her routine safe and predictable. If he’s open to negotiating a modest two‑bedroom setup—perhaps by splitting costs or finding a more affordable unit—that could be a win‑win.

z5me6m,AITAH for expecting my parents to help me out financially through post secondary education?,"I (21F) got in a huge argument with my (41M) step-dad last week over finances regarding my education and living situation. I apologize in advance if i'm giving too many details but I think they are important for the full story. 

For some context I'm the eldest of 5 children (3 from my moms side) 13F half-sis mom shared, 19F full sis, (2 from step-dad) 15M step-sibling and 19F step-sibling. My half-sis (13F) is with her dad 50% of the time, my full sis and I's father stopped paying child support when I was 10 and is out of the picture due to alcoholism, and my step siblings mother passed away in 2011. My mother and step father got together in 2013 and we re-located to the city my step father already lived in that same year to all live together.

We all apart from my 13F half-sis lived with our parents full time up until last year when my (19F step-sis) moved out with her bf into one of those portable trailers that attach to the back of a truck bed parked on her grandfathers property (my step grandpa). She moved out due to conflict with my parents. She is attending uni next semester through student loans at a local college. 

My step-dad makes around 175k a year managing his fathers company with him, and my mother although holds a diploma in nursing (LPN in Canada) has not worked for the last year and a half.

Now that the backstory is in place I can get into it. My parents are currently not speaking to me over an argument I had a week ago with my step-father. It started out as my brother getting a form signed to go into full-time IB for his grade 11 and 12 year. I asked why he was doing IB, my parents explained it was because he gets his first year off of uni credits. This is only true if he is going into a general degree and a couple weeks ago he was telling everyone he wanted to go into Architecture (IB will not count), I think it's a bad idea, his credits will not count towards the degree he wants to go in and he has awful study habits, I don't think he understands the amount of effort he will have to put into IB, none of the less, not my problem, but this is how the conversation started. 

I asked how he is going to afford to go to university as I have been having an extremely hard time affording it myself and my parents said ""what do you mean of course we will help him, all of you kids are going to go to university"". I responded with ""you have not helped me I have had to delay my studies in order to afford it myself"". This turned into an argument where both me and my step father were raising our voices, and me crying while my mother did not say much. She chimed in saying I transferred money to her a couple times but my step dad didn't really listen. My step-father was insisting he payed 6K towards my school, then brought the number down to 3K, when in reality it has been $0-500 he has contributed. Where this gets confusing is we have been using his account to pay my tuition and I have transferred my mother the money as my college does not accept transfers through my specific bank. My dads money is my moms money, she does not work but they have both joint and separate accounts. All in all for 30 credits of my BSN &amp; a 6 month certificate program I took has cost $8400. $3196 I have proof I transferred (my bank only lets me go back a year), 1.9K from my moms parents I have proof of, and 1.5K my bio dads mom gave me. 1800$ is unaccounted for as I can't go that far back in my banking, there is no record. He had his finger pointed in my face calling me a brat, spoiled and selfish for reacting harshly for calling him out on his lie. He has not contributed to my school, for him to be remotely right that would mean I paid for nothing of my 30 credits when I did, I transferred my mother money, we don't know the exact amount. I can remember 1 semester he MAYBE topped off around $500 and that is being generous. 

Due to his income I cannot get student loans, I have applied, they sent a letter back saying I qualified for 0$. The average cost of a 1 bedroom basement suit where I live is $1600 a month. It is next to impossible to afford rent as a student. In order to be classified as an independent student not attached to my parents income I have to be 4 years post graduated HS, or live on my own for 1 whole year. MAX student loan is 1.5k per month. For my major (nursing) I have to have a vehicle, it is noted in the entrance requirements as some clinical placements are 1-2 hr drive away from the school, 12hr shifts with no transiting options. So this is another expense. I live 1.5-2hr commute to any uni/ college, 3-4hr both ways. I pay 100% of my car expenses $500 fixed (250 insurance lowest possible for my age I know crazy here in British Columbia, 250 paying my parents back as they paid upfront) + gas. 10k tuition a year when I continue. I went to school Monday-Friday and worked Saturday &amp; Sundays. No days off for months. The only thing my parents help out with is not charging me rent or food (I'm small I eat maybe $200 worth of groceries a month), their rent would not go down if I moved out, they would probably use my room as storage. I plan on moving out for the other 3 years of my BSN with my bf but without saving 1.5k/month for the next year I wont be able to afford it, even with max student loans. AITA for expecting them to contribute to my education when they said they will be helping my brother? AITA for calling him out on his lie? I have delayed my education for so long as I can't get loans. I have been the only child in university for the last 3 years.

I had a baby in april. My husband and I went out to a Park, just to catch some walk and sun, and be out. 
I was sitting in a bench, holding my child in my chest, with his head on my shoulder when a unknown lady comes from behind saying: “what a beautiful baby” and extending her hand out to touch his face/head. I almost saw everything in slow Motion. I told her to please not touch him. The lady was really offended and replied that she loves babies and no one ever told her no. I repeated that she cannot touch him, since I dont know her. She left fuming and saying I was crazy. My husband actually told me that Im being an AH for telling her no, instead of just obliging. 

I feel I was right. But… AITA?

Edit: thank you all for your kind comments. Its very hard as a mom to know when you go “momcrazy” or being rational. Thanks","NTA 

I don’t understand why people think babies and pregnant people become public property.  She could have germs on her dirty hands which coupd make your baby sick.  Good for you for standing up to an entitled witch.  You did the right thing.",NTA,"NTA. Absolutely not the AH. I didn’t have to read the explanation, I was very quick to say no. You’re the mother, you decide who can &amp; can’t. Hell, even if it was someone you know — that is your choice! She can get over it. What if she had a cold sore or any virus on her hands?? That’s something that could be with your child forever",NTA,"It sounds like you’re feeling uncertain about whether your protective instincts were appropriate in this situation. It’s completely natural to want to keep your baby safe, especially considering the current concerns about health and hygiene. Your reaction seems rooted in a desire to protect your child, which is a fundamental aspect of being a parent. It's understandable that the lady might have been taken aback, but setting boundaries is important, especially when it comes to your baby’s well-being. 

Your husband’s perspective might be coming from a place of wanting to avoid conflict, but it's crucial that you feel empowered to make decisions you believe are best for your child. Trusting your instincts is key, and it doesn't make you an AH to prioritize your baby's safety over a stranger's feelings. Open communication with your husband about why you felt it was necessary to set that boundary might help him understand your perspective better. Ultimately, you know your child’s needs best, and it’s okay to stand by your decision.",NTA,"I hear how conflicted you're feeling about this situation, especially with your husband's reaction making you question yourself. But I want to affirm that protecting your baby from strangers touching them is completely normal and responsible parenting - not ""momcrazy"" at all.

It's concerning that your husband thinks you should have ""just obliged"" - you're not obligated to let strangers touch your child, regardless of their age or intentions. The lady's reaction of being offended because ""no one ever told her no"" actually highlights why setting boundaries is so important.

You handled this situation perfectly by being direct but polite. In our current times especially, it's perfectly reasonable to not want strangers touching your baby. Your maternal instinct to protect your child's personal space and health is something to be proud of, not questioned.

Remember: You're not being rude by setting boundaries - others are being rude by not respecting them. Keep trusting your instincts as a mother.",NTA,"It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain and defensive about the situation. I want to reassure you that your reaction was completely reasonable. As a new mother, it's natural to be protective of your baby, and with good reason. You don't know this lady, and it's perfectly fine to set boundaries around physical contact with your child.

It's interesting that your husband reacted by saying you were being unreasonable. I wonder if he might be coming from a place of not wanting to cause a scene or offend someone, rather than considering the potential risks or your feelings as a mother.

Your comment about not knowing when to go 'momcrazy' or being rational is relatable. It's okay to prioritize your baby's safety and well-being, even if it means being assertive or saying no to someone. In this situation, it sounds like you were simply advocating for your child's boundaries, and that's not something to apologize for.",NTA,"It’s completely understandable that you felt the need to protect your baby. A stranger approaching a newborn is a natural trigger for a parent’s instinct to keep them safe, especially when you’ve just had a child. Saying “no” is a legitimate boundary, and the lady’s reaction, while uncomfortable, doesn’t mean you were wrong. Your husband’s comment may have felt dismissive, but it’s not a reflection of what’s right for you. You could offer a brief apology—“Sorry, I just want to keep him safe”—to ease the tension, but you’re not obligated to give in if you’re uneasy.

I have been thinking about this for a few days now, and broke up with her bc I don’t want her to change who she is for me. And if we stayed together, I will be competing for her affection, and I shouldn’t be doing that in a relationship. When I broke things off she told me I was an asshole. When I told my friend about, he said he understood my point of view but still called me the asshole. So am I the asshole?","NTA. You were respectful and said you did not want that, not your fault. She should have been more open with you before you got together.",NTA,"I would say NTA. She should said she was Polyamerous before you started dating so you knew before hand so you could decide if you wanted to enter into that kind of relationship. 

The way you said ""And if we stayed together, I will be competing for her affection, and I shouldn’t be doing that in a relationship."" Does come off as very a holish though. You basically just tried to invalidate poly relationships. 

It's fine to not want one for yourself, but try to be respectful that other people do and that it does work WITHOUT people feeling as though they are competing for affection.

Sincerely: Someone who is in fact in a happy Poly relationship.",NTA,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and it’s understandable to feel conflicted. It’s important to recognize that everyone has different needs and boundaries in relationships. You’re not an asshole for wanting a relationship structure that aligns with your values and comfort level. Polyamory works for some people, but it’s not for everyone. It seems like you made a thoughtful decision by acknowledging that her lifestyle and your expectations didn’t match. It shows respect for both yourself and her by not forcing a change that neither of you might be happy with in the long run. Relationships should be about mutual understanding and respect, and it's okay to walk away if your needs are fundamentally different. Remember, it's better to be honest about your needs now rather than trying to change each other and ending up unhappy.",NTA,"I hear how conflicted you're feeling about this situation. It's clear you've put genuine thought into this decision, considering both her needs and your own. Breaking up because of fundamentally different relationship values doesn't make you an asshole - it shows maturity in recognizing incompatibility early rather than trying to force a change or compromising your own comfort.

Your reasoning about not wanting to compete for affection and not wanting her to change who she is shows respect for both yourself and her. While your girlfriend and friend may be hurt or disagree, you have every right to choose the type of relationship that aligns with your values and needs.

It's worth noting that the emotional reaction you received might be more about the pain of rejection than your actual decision.

It's not about being an 'asshole,' but rather about recognizing your own needs and boundaries in a relationship. It's clear you've thought this through and made a decision that aligns with your values and expectations.

y6ye7h,AITAH for not forgetting my partner's cheating history?,"I, 31 F, am living with my partner 34 M in a one bedroom apartment. I caught him multiple times cheating with different girls. I have no idea whether or not they replied to him or even met him in person.  He always DM them things that almost in the border of him feeling lust towards their pictures. I tried to forgive him but everytime I ask where he is, he gets angry and say mean things to me. To get even, I always bring up that I won't have trust issues if he had been loyal in the first place then recalling all his past chats. Am I being unfair saying that I forgive him even if I never forgot all these things he did? I admit, when I am alone the screenshots of the DMs he sent still eat me alive.","YTA to yourself. He’s showed you “multiple times” that he doesn’t respect you, and so far you’ve refused to believe him. Have some respect for yourself and leave.",YTA,"NTA. Apology without a changed behavior is manipulation. It is his fault that he has cheated. If you decided to forgive him, he should be grateful you’re still with him. Now the forgetting part is difficult. Since it was his fault for cheating, he needs to go out of his way to give you reassurance. For example, turn his location on, call you, take you with him when he’s out etc. Only by reassurance, over time that trust can be somewhat restored.

Also, the other comments are saying that you are not sure if he cheated or if he was just DMing girls. To be honest, DMing girls is not “nothing”. Don’t invalidate OP’s feelings. It’s pretty embarrassing for a woman when your 34 year old partner acts like a high school kid and gives everyone attention.",NTA,"It sounds like you're caught in a really difficult and painful situation. Trust is fundamental in a relationship, and when it's broken, it can be incredibly hard to rebuild. It's understandable that you're struggling to forget what happened, especially if his actions continue to hurt you. Your feelings of betrayal and the impact on your ability to trust are valid. It seems like you're trying to navigate between wanting to forgive and protect yourself from further hurt.

However, it might be helpful to examine whether holding onto these past events is serving you or your relationship. Forgiveness doesn’t necessarily mean forgetting, but it does mean finding a way to move forward, whether together or apart. Open and honest communication with your partner about how his actions have affected you might be necessary. You both deserve to feel secure and respected in the relationship, and if that's not possible, it may be worth considering whether this relationship is meeting your emotional needs. Seeking support from a counselor or therapist could also offer guidance as you work through these complex emotions.",NO_VERDICT,"You're not being unfair at all. Trust, once broken, takes significant time and genuine effort from both parties to rebuild. From what you've described, your partner isn't showing remorse or making efforts to rebuild trust - instead, he's becoming defensive and hostile when you seek basic reassurance about his whereabouts.

The fact that the screenshots still haunt you and he continues to react with anger rather than understanding suggests that true healing hasn't occurred in your relationship. Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting or pretending the hurt never happened. It seems like you're carrying the emotional burden of his infidelity while he's avoiding accountability.

Consider whether this dynamic is healthy for you. A partner who truly wants to rebuild trust after cheating should be patient, transparent, and understanding of your need for reassurance - not responding with anger and mean comments. You deserve a relationship where you feel secure and respected, not one where you're constantly wrestling with trust issues while your partner dismisses your valid concerns.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're struggling to reconcile your desire to forgive your partner with the lingering pain and mistrust caused by his past infidelity. On one hand, you want to move forward and rebuild your relationship, but on the other, the memories of his cheating still hurt and make you feel vulnerable. It's understandable that you bring up his past actions when he becomes defensive or angry, as it feels like a way to protect yourself and remind him of the hurt he caused.

However, it's also important to acknowledge that holding onto these memories and using them as a way to ""get even"" might be preventing you from truly healing and moving forward. It's possible that your partner feels like he's being punished for past mistakes, which could be contributing to his defensiveness. I'm not saying that his behavior is justified, but rather that the way you're handling the situation might be perpetuating a cycle of hurt and anger. It might be helpful to explore ways to address your feelings and work towards rebuilding trust in a more constructive way.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy load—caught between the hope that he could change and the reality of what’s happened. You’re not “forgiving” in the sense of forgetting; you’re trying to balance love for him with the hurt that still lingers. That tension is exhausting. The fact that you’re still haunted by the screenshots shows the betrayal still sits in your mind, and it’s natural that flash‑backs feel almost like a physical ache. It’s not about fairness or unfairness; it’s about whether you can rebuild trust when the foundation feels cracked.

zccip4,AITAH for telling my best friends girlfriend to grow up and allegedly ruining his relationship,"
I (21f) and my best friend (21m) we will call him “B”, had been best friends since we were born, growing up right across the street from each other. When I say best friends, we literally talked (if we weren’t hanging out) until this incident all day everyday. 

Last February (2021) B met a girl where he lives named E (19f) and they began dating, B moved 3 hours away after high school but we still saw each other frequently. He wanted me to meet her, so he brought her to our hometown to hangout. Her and I got along so good, and for about 2 months we all remained close, I considered her one of my best friends. 

Her and B had an argument, B reached out to me via text to vent. I do not like to be involved in any way, but he is my best friend and it is my job to be a shoulder to lean on. He didn’t say much, and in my responses to him I sort of defended E as this situation I understood her side more. There was maybe 6 exchanged texts totals and they were fine not even 20 min later. Or so I thought…

Fast forward to Easter, E goes through his phone and looks at our texts. I had not known this until asking why she began to ghost me for a week. She broke up with B and blamed him venting to me as “being a part of their relationship” even though B is the one who came to me, and told B she felt as if he listened to my advice more serious than hers. So as you readers can already see where this is going, it was a “her or me” type deal from E. She told B she would not give him another chance until I talked to her and apologized  for “being a part of their relationship.” B begged that I do this for him despite him admittedly knowing she was in the wrong. I did it only because I knew how much it meant to him, not that I felt like I did anything wrong. She never responded, she didn’t get back with him like she said, she instead tormented him and emotionally abused him said extremely disgusting things about me. B even caught her back with her (said to be abusive)  ex. At this point, B was in pain so I sent an additional text telling her to grow up. This made things harder for B as she immediately blocked his # and he decided to blame loosing her on me, in which I sent a final text to him as well telling him how I feel about him throwing me into this situation and how hurt I was. He never responded and it has been 7 months since we have spoken. 

I thought I did everything I could for him despite the situation he dragged me into and how badly E treated me, and how he let her do so. AITA for sending her that final text and causing this? I am so hurt that I feel I should have let them continue to treat me poorly so I didn’t lose his friendship permanently. I feel I am grieving the loss of someone who is still alive. 

Disclaimer: I have my own bf (23) of 8 years, this is NOT a situation where the girl best friend  deep down wants the guy.","You are NTA. He put you in the middle of the situation, you reacted like any friend would, and it sounds like they had a toxic relationship. You probably shouldn’t have sent that text, mostly because there was no point to it at that point in their relationship. Your friend and his ex girlfriend are the assholes here.",NTA,You were LITERALLY attached at the hip?

You were put in a difficult position, where you were trying to support your best friend, B, and maintain a friendship with E. It seems like your intentions were to help and not to interfere negatively in their relationship.

It's important to remember that friendships and relationships can be very complex, and sometimes people react in ways that are unexpected. It seems like E's reaction and B's subsequent blame were beyond your control. You were honest with B about your feelings, which shows that you value authenticity and transparency.

You might consider reaching out to B again, expressing that you miss his friendship and are open to a conversation if he's willing. Sometimes, time can bring clarity and healing. Regardless of the outcome, remember that you deserve to be treated with respect, and it's okay to set boundaries when you feel mistreated.

Ultimately, you're not responsible for how others choose to handle their emotions, and it's okay to prioritize your well-being.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on the dialog example and situation described, here's my response:

You're not the asshole here. It seems you're carrying a lot of guilt over a situation that wasn't your fault. You acted as any good friend would - being supportive when B needed to vent, even trying to see E's perspective, and ultimately standing up for yourself when things became toxic.

E's behavior shows clear signs of controlling and manipulative tactics - going through B's phone, creating ultimatums, and using emotional abuse. While it hurts deeply to lose such a long-term friendship, B made his choice to enable this toxic behavior rather than recognize the unfair position you were put in.

It's natural to second-guess yourself and wonder if you should have just accepted the poor treatment to keep the peace. But maintaining healthy boundaries, even when painful, doesn't make you the bad person. You're grieving the loss of an important friendship, and that's completely valid. Sometimes standing up for ourselves costs us relationships, but that doesn't mean we were wrong to do so.",NTA,"You sound incredibly hurt and torn by this situation. On one hand, you feel like you did everything you could for your best friend, B, despite being dragged into a complicated situation with E. On the other hand, you're left wondering if you should have just let things go to avoid losing B's friendship. It seems like you were put in a very difficult position - being asked to apologize for something you didn't feel was your fault, and then being blamed for the consequences of your actions.

It's understandable that you would want to tell E to ""grow up"" after the way she treated you and B, especially given her history of emotional abuse. It's not like you went out of your way to sabotage their relationship; B came to you for support and you were trying to be a good friend. It's also worth noting that E's behavior was toxic and controlling, and B's willingness to blame you for their breakup is concerning.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’ve been caught in a very painful middle ground. You cared about B enough to step in, and you were honest with him when he asked for support. When E read your texts she saw you as an ally to her, not an enemy, and that misalignment turned a simple “vent” into a conflict that hurt everyone. Your last text to E—“grow up”—was a defensive reaction to being dragged into the drama, but it also escalated the situation and hurt B, who was already in pain.  

You did what you thought was right at the time, and you’re now paying the price. Give yourself permission to grieve that loss, but also recognize that setting boundaries (like not involving yourself in their private arguments) might protect you in the future. If you want to mend the friendship, a calm, honest conversation with B, explaining your perspective and listening to his, could help. Until then, focus on your own healing and the healthy relationship you have with your boyfriend.",NO_VERDICT
xsdbjn,AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend because he was late to our one year anniversary?,"I (F18) and my boyfriend Liam (M19) were supposed to go on a date for our one year anniversary. It was 9:00 in the morning and our date was in an hour meaning I didn’t get much time to get ready as I wanted to make the date super special. I wore a dress he bought me when we were just 5 months and shoes I bought 3 days before the anniversary. I straightened my hair and styled it and all of that caused me to have 20 minutes left until the date started. Liam had texted me saying he’s gonna be 15 minutes late and I assumed that was because he was making a special surprise for us so I just responded with a quick “ok!” I had went to the restaurant 10 minutes early and waited for about 30 minutes, when I had texted him asking when he was coming he told me that he couldn’t go because his dad needed him for something important and he lives about 20 minutes away from him. I asked why it was so important and he didn’t respond. It’s been nearly 10 minutes. 

I texted him saying, “Liam, I have prepared a lot for our one year anniversary. I thought this was something special for us, what is so important that you have to miss it?” He read it and rudely asked if it was a prank as I always joke around with him. I was so disappointed. He texted me telling me that he had forgotten and thought we were going on a regular date. I was so upset and tears were about to come out of my eyes. I waited a while to see if he would respond and apologize and to also calm myself down. I had left the restaurant and walked to my car as I didn’t get a response but right when I open my car door I see his car parking. When he had left the car, his appearance had seemed to have no effort. He quickly ran to me and apologized.

I told him to give me a couple days and that I didn’t wanna talk to him at the moment. I went in my car and was on my way home. I quickly noticed that his car was following mine and when I got home I opened the door and went inside locking it quickly. I get a text shortly after of Liam telling me to open the door so that we could talk about it. I ignored the text for nearly 20 minutes and prepared some food, I couldn’t get my mind off of it so I shortly left the food I was preparing on the counter and unlocked the door. To my surprise he had already left. I started to cry.

I sent him paragraphs of how I had prepared so much for our anniversary and he just shows up effortlessly dressed and had just left without understanding that I needed some time until I wanted to talk to you and just left. He told me that he was genuinely sorry and that he had left because I made him wait outside for nearly 20 minutes without hearing his explanation. I called him asking for his explanation and I heard his dad saying “So have you told her yet?” I asked Liam what his dad was talking about but he shortly ended the call and I knew it was something serious that he’s been keeping from me and I didn’t want to get more hurt mentally when I find out what it is so I chose to tell him that I wanted to break up to make things less complicated.","Yeah. You kinda suck here. But I’m assuming it’s cause you’re still very young. 

1. You can’t expect your secret efforts to be as important to him as they are to you. 

2. You were aware something happened with his father and still only focused on you. You could have actually listened to him. Sure leave the restaurant but be an adult and have a conversation. 

3. You literally expected him to stand outside begging for you like some dumbass romance? That’s not how real life works. 

4. You didn’t break up to make things less complicated. You broke up with him because his perception of the day and his priorities didn’t immediately align with what you wanted. And you’re likely hoping he comes chasing after you.

It's important to prioritize your own feelings and mental well-being. If you felt that breaking up was the best decision to protect yourself from further emotional pain, then that’s a valid choice. Relationships require effort and understanding from both sides, and if you felt like this wasn’t happening, it's okay to reevaluate the relationship.

Take the time you need to reflect on what you want and need in a relationship. It might also help to have a calm conversation with Liam later on to understand what was going on from his perspective when you're ready. Remember, your feelings are important, and taking care of yourself should always be a priority.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on this situation, I can understand why you're feeling hurt and frustrated. The lack of effort and communication from Liam, especially on such a significant date, is concerning. However, there seem to be some deeper issues at play here, particularly with the mysterious conversation you overheard with his dad.

While breaking up might feel like the right move to protect yourself, it appears you made this decision without having all the information. Sometimes fear of being hurt can lead us to make defensive decisions that might not be in our best interest. The fact that Liam followed you home and waited to explain suggests there might be more to the story.

That said, your feelings are valid. You put considerable effort into making the day special, while he seemed unprepared and dismissive initially. If you want to reconsider the breakup, you might want to have an honest conversation with Liam about what's really going on.

It seems like you were trying to communicate your hurt and disappointment to Liam, but he wasn't fully hearing you or taking responsibility for his actions. When you finally had the courage to express your feelings and concerns, he ended the call and left you wondering what was going on.

Breaking up with Liam might be a way for you to protect yourself from further hurt, but I want to acknowledge that it's not an easy decision. It's clear that you care about him and were invested in the relationship. However, it's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take care of yourself.

The key moving forward is to give yourself time to process the hurt before making any permanent decisions. If Liam wants to talk, try setting a concrete time and place, and ask him to explain the “dad” thing and why he couldn’t honor the date.

The couple would have had their own room and bathroom upstairs. 
Couple backed out bc all of the following:

zvg8v3,AITAH for not wanting to be involved with my In Laws now?,"When our kids were 1 &amp; 3 yrs, we undertook major house renovations as Owner-Builders including removing the roof, adding another storey, staircase etc and re-roofing the house. 

My husband did a lot of the coordination and physical work, while I (32F) still worked, looked after kids, ran the household (cooking, pets etc), handled finances and building admin like getting quotes. 

My husband had a serious accident with several significant internal injuries. Big operation, was in hospital for 10 days, and then literally laid on the couch extremely unwell for 4 mths (he had several follow up surgeries in that time). 

It was unclear at the time whether he would fully recover or have life-long problems. 

At the time of his accident, we had no roof on the house, and it was summer/Christmas shut down here in Australia. I needed to get some painting and other tasks done before the roof went on in early January. 
With no tradespeople available, I begged all our friends, my-in-laws and all our acquaintances for help so I could juggle it all. 
(I have no family in Australia). 

My in laws opted not to help: not an hour of child minding, not a meal dropped off, no help with the renovation project. They decided that I was wildly exaggerating and they were busy with their own lives. 
...anyway, with the help of friends, I got the prep done, roof went onto the house. Kids somehow had food and clean clothes each day and even wrapped Christmas gifts. I even managed to visit my husband in hospital briefly to make him feel settled. 

Now, I don't feel like hanging out with my in laws. They weren't there for me when I truly needed them. They just made zero effort for me, they didn't even call or text to check in.

My husband says they aren't great but are the only family he has, it's a while ago now and I should suck it up. 

He is welcome to see them, but when I can, I prefer to not go along. 

AITAH?","NTA and I don’t understand why your husband would want to see them. But I agree with you, that’s up to him but I wouldn’t visit and not sure I would even want my kids seeing them.",NTA,"NTA and I don’t understand why your husband would want to see them. But I agree with you, that’s up to him but I wouldn’t visit and not sure I would even want my kids seeing them.",NTA,"It sounds like you went through an incredibly challenging time, juggling multiple responsibilities under immense pressure. It's understandable that you feel hurt and disappointed by your in-laws' lack of support during such a critical period. It seems you did everything possible to keep things together, and having no help from them when you needed it most must have been difficult.

Your feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge that. It's natural to want to distance yourself from those who weren't there for you in a time of crisis. However, maintaining a relationship with your in-laws for the sake of family dynamics, especially considering your husband's perspective, might be worth considering in the long run.

Perhaps having an open conversation with your husband about your feelings could help both of you find a balance that respects your emotional needs while also considering his family ties. It might also be beneficial to set boundaries that allow you to protect your well-being while navigating familial relationships.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on your experience, you are not the asshole for wanting to distance yourself from your in-laws. Their complete lack of support during a genuine family crisis - when your husband was seriously injured, you had no roof over your head, and two young children to care for - reveals a concerning lack of empathy and family commitment.

While your husband's perspective about them being his only family is understandable, you're not preventing him from maintaining his relationship with them. You're simply choosing to limit your own interaction based on their past behavior, which is a reasonable boundary to set.

Their decision to dismiss your situation as ""wildly exaggerating"" rather than offering even minimal support (like a meal or quick check-in) demonstrates poor judgment and a concerning lack of care for their own son's family in crisis.

It's healthy to acknowledge these feelings rather than ""sucking it up."" Consider maintaining polite but limited contact for major family events while supporting your husband's choice to have his own relationship with them.",NTA,"It sounds like you felt deeply hurt and abandoned by your in-laws during a critical moment in your life. It's understandable that their lack of support, especially when you reached out for help, has left a lasting impression on you.

It's not about 'sucking it up' or pretending like everything is okay when it's not. Your feelings are valid, and you have every right to set boundaries that make you feel comfortable. It's also interesting that your husband acknowledges they're not great, but still wants you to be involved with them.

Rather than asking if you're the 'asshole' in this situation, perhaps it's more about acknowledging your hurt and recognizing that you deserve to be treated with love, care, and support from those around you. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and not feel obligated to spend time with people who didn't show up for you when you needed them most.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’ve carried a huge load—homework, kids, finances, and a husband in a very vulnerable state—without the support you expected. When people say “they’re the only family he has,” it can feel dismissive of your own limits, especially after you’ve already pulled so much of yourself together. It’s understandable you’re upset that your in‑laws didn’t step up when you needed them most. You’re not obligated to force a relationship that feels one‑sided, especially if it adds stress. A compromise could be to set clear boundaries: invite them only for major events, but keep the everyday interactions minimal. That way you honor your own needs while still leaving space for your husband’s family ties if he wants them. You’re not being selfish—you’re protecting your well‑being.",NTA
vuiaj1,I understand that this is a 1st world problem and I sound Spolied AF... buuuttttt,"So when I was a single parent (technically I was with a dead beat that didn't contribute to the household) my parents and I came to an agreement that of I completed my College courses with straight A's they would pay off my car.

I did... damn was it hard with a new born and just recently being abandoned by deadbeat.

So now anytime they need an EXTRA CAR they come to me... whatever I guess small price to pay for a car but nah... we need to go to Mexico, we need to go to Texas, we need to...however when anyone else needs it or my own parents don't want to be inconvenienced; its my car they ask for as well.

This last time, family borrowed it while in town, gave it to them washed and full tank, EVERYTHING IN WORKING ORDER.

Well FFS they drove my little car (that even I don't drive like this) 2000 miles in ONE F@CKEN WEEK!!!


Like dudes, if you knew this kind of usage was going on why in the h3ll wouldn't you just let them rent one... 

Now I'm stuck with the up keep, had to get an oil change as my car was basically left with NO OIL, half a tank, and bald tired like did y'all go to drifting events!?! 

So I asked told my dad about all the up keep that the car needs and his response was...

You worked hard to earn that car, and it's understandable to feel upset when others don't treat it with the same care you do. It's not just about the physical wear and tear, but also about feeling respected and valued by your family for the effort you put in, both in the past and now. It's important to set boundaries to protect your belongings and your peace of mind. Maybe you could have a conversation with your family about setting clearer expectations for car usage in the future, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the car's condition for your own needs. It's okay to assert your needs and remind them of the mutual respect that should come with borrowing something as significant as a car. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to have them acknowledged.",NO_VERDICT,"I can hear how frustrated and conflicted you're feeling about this situation. On one side, you feel a sense of obligation because your parents helped you get the car when you really needed it. But on the other side, it seems like this arrangement has evolved into something that's really taking advantage of your generosity and causing you genuine financial and practical hardship.

The fact that your father dismissed your valid concerns about the car's condition after such intense use must feel especially hurtful. It's okay to feel bothered by this - setting boundaries with family is complicated, especially when there's a history of financial support involved.

Perhaps you could try having a calm conversation with your parents about establishing some ground rules for car borrowing - like limitations on mileage, returning it with a full tank, or sharing maintenance costs when the car is used for extended trips. This isn't about being ungrateful; it's about ensuring the car remains reliable for your own needs as a parent.

Remember, acknowledging their help doesn't mean you have to accept unlimited use of your property without any consideration for the consequences.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you feel taken advantage of and frustrated with the situation. On one hand, you're grateful for the support your parents provided in paying off your car, but on the other hand, you feel like they're not respecting your property. It's like they're not considering the wear and tear their requests are putting on your car, and that's causing tension.

It's interesting that your dad responded by telling you to stop saying it's because they borrowed the car. It seems like he's not willing to acknowledge the impact their actions had on your vehicle. This might be a sign that you need to have a more direct conversation with your parents about boundaries and expectations when it comes to using your car. Have you considered setting some clear guidelines for when they can use your car, or exploring alternative options for when they need transportation?",NO_VERDICT,"I hear how stretched and frustrated you feel—your car’s been a lifeline, and it’s walked miles it wasn’t built for. When family keeps borrowing it, especially for long trips, the wear and tear adds up fast, and it’s not fair for you to shoulder those costs without a clear agreement. It sounds like your dad’s minimising the impact, which can feel dismissive of your concerns. A constructive next step might be to sit down with the family and set a simple rule: if someone wants to use the car for a trip longer than a day, they either pay a modest “usage fee” or rent a vehicle instead. That way you’re not left covering oil, tires, and repairs, and everyone knows the boundaries. You deserve respect for the effort you’ve put in—especially with a newborn on your plate.",NO_VERDICT

Since being together we broke up once and both saw other people then ended up getting back together. During that time his mom and dad stalked me on social media and said I was a whore, cheater, and liar for having a new bf at the time. When we did get back together him and I found out I was pregnant. So we decided to move in together. (His parents said I should get an abortion and leave his life). Just some back story, I’ve been on my own since i was 18 and he’s lived with his parents his whole life. Since living together his parents expect him to still pay bills at there house, let them use his truck and not put gas, and take up a lot of his time. I told him that none of these things he has to do but he told me to be more “understanding and don’t judge”. Things he didn’t say when I was being called nasty names by them. So I said if he wanted to help then he could but I wouldn’t be paying any bills he’s short on (his truck payments and braces) if he wanted to just use the money for them.

Your boyfriend appears caught between loyalty to his parents and his relationship with you, but he's not acknowledging how their behavior has affected you. It's concerning that he expects you to be ""understanding"" of his parents while they've shown no understanding toward you.

You're not being controlling by protecting your financial wellbeing. At 18, you've already shown independence by living on your own, while your boyfriend at 26 seems to still have strong financial ties to his parents.

I am currently on my family’s vacation and am taking time out of this trip to go to the wedding. I have a long day of travel. A 3 hr bus ride and two 3.5hr flights. My boyfriend will only be going on the second 3.5 hour flight ( he is closer). I found out that I was upgraded to first class on my last flight. Originally we were not sitting next to each other but planned to ask a fellow passenger to switch. Now that I’ve been upgraded I feel less inclined to switch. I don’t want to deal with that time between when the plane boards asking if someone wants to switch and then doing it. Travel stresses me out. I’m one of those people who has to get there really early. Its a red eye flight. I also just want to have a nice seat it’s along day for me and this trip is only 4 days so I’ll be doing it again all too soon. I told my boyfriend this and he’s saying I’m selfish and privileged. I know I am privileged, but is it too much to want to stay in my seat? It’s only a 3.5 hr flight. He’s blowing up my text and saying I am trying to make him TA. So AITA?","You are going through 2 long days of travel to be there at HIS family event, you get upgraded by the airline, and he's throwing a temper tantrum about you being privileged? LOL

Plan on enjoying the upgrade with him or without him or not attending the wedding at all if he continues with the tantrum.

Communicating openly with your boyfriend about why this is important to you might help. It seems like there's a misunderstanding about your intentions, and clarifying that you need this break for your own well-being could ease some tension.

It's worth considering if there might be deeper issues at play here - perhaps he's feeling anxious about introducing you to his family, or there are other underlying concerns about feeling prioritized in the relationship.

It’s understandable to want to avoid the awkward “can I switch?” conversation, especially if you’re a “get‑there‑early” type who hates travel stress.

That said, the frustration your boyfriend feels comes from feeling left out or “second” on a special trip. A quick, calm chat—“I’ve been upgraded and it would really help me rest.

zbh2g3,AITAH for refusing to research open realtionships,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My Fiancee, started a new job just over a year ago and I was ecstatic for her. She loves her job and has made alot of new friends who are generally cool people. One of these friends I will call, Becca she has got extremely close to and considers her best friend.

Last week we were having a few quiet drinks after date night and my Fiancee began talking about Becca and how her and her husband are ina open marriage. I kind of suspected this is the case from the times we have hung out with them and I don't judge them for it, they seem happy. I do know however this is something that i wouldnt want, and i was clear about this at the start of our relationship.

My Fiancee then admitted she had been talking to Becca about it and states she has been thinking about it over the last few weeks and she would be curious to hear more about it and wanted me to do some research with her. I was quite taken back and reminded her of my stance on open relationships, that we have discussed previously. This started a small argument of which she said that people can change their views over time and was upset that I refused to look into it with her. She called me narrow-minded and said it is better to be educated about such things, even if we don't end up doing it. I declined to look intp it and she ended up going to bed after this and ever since she the atmosphere has been cold and she has been distant. 

I love her very much and don't want to lose her but I know that I wouldnt be able to have an open relationship or invite someone else to bed with us.

Tonight he was over and we were watching a movie and just talking and he made a comment about how when he was in the military that when he first became part of the infantry unit that women were not allowed to be in it and when he was leaving the military is when women were allowed to join. He made the comment that women shouldn’t be in combat because “we can’t made sound decisions during our period” and continued in saying that women shouldn’t be doing certain jobs because we can’t “lift” as much as a man.

There are people in republic of Ireland and UK using the device but there are no jobs currently available. 

He offered me to come over and give a talk to see if I like it but the post doc job would be there if I wanted it. I wasn’t originally looking or thinking of America because I never thought it was even on the cards that I would get the opportunity. 

My boyfriend (also 25) and I have been together/ living together for nearly 3 years. He’s my best friend and I want to spend the rest of my life with him (the possibility of marriage and kids etc in around 5 years has been discussed). 

From the start of my PhD we discussed how I would have to move away given the lack of opportunities in Northern Ireland for post docs. On top of that covid has reduced the amount of funding available for research and labs here are really struggling. We even told his friend, a couple of months ago that we wouldn’t know where we would be next year because of my job situation. I said I may have to move to Europe or at least mainland UK.

I was in France at a conference and the opportunity of being written into a grant was discussed. I spoke to my boyfriend about this but he felt it would be too difficult for him to integrate into Paris life as we don’t speak French and while I would be ok in an English speaking lab he probably wouldn’t have that at a job. I thought fair enough that’s a very valid point which would surely apply to all European countries. I did consider if I could go alone and do long distance for a year or so given it’s only a 1.5 hour flight and I felt really comfortable on my own there. Nothing ever came to fruition from it anyway and so we didn’t speak about it again.

When I was offered the all inclusive paid trip from the American PI to go and see if I liked the area and lab I was so shocked. It was only a few days later after meeting him so it was pretty overwhelming but he had outright said it’s ok if you don’t like it, it’s still an invited talk for your cv and I thought no brainer I’ll go for the 5 days. My bf agreed to come too to see if he would potentially move with me. That was all ok and my flights were booked. I got really excited about the opportunity. 

Weeks went by and I kept asking my bf to apply for his ESTA but he kept putting it off. He finally revealed he didn’t want to move there so felt there was no point going. This came as a shock to me but I blurted out the words ‘do you think we could do long distance’ without really thinking about it. He burst into tears and then so did I. I tried explaining how these opportunities don’t come around to everyone and that it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I quoted one of my colleagues that this was the PhD dream to go to a conference and be offered your dream job from just speaking to the PI. I advocated for myself which is something I really struggled with in the past. But it didn’t feel good. It felt like I had put a knife to his heart and twisted it with every word. So I stopped and we sobbed. 

We sobbed for a few weeks every night. He works from 7am-10/11pm 5-6 days a week with no time for conversations in between so we were both knackered but him especially. After a week or so I brought it up again and we sobbed again, he asked could I not just get a job in industry. I felt insulted considering he worked at an industry company here and hated it and left after 6 weeks. And I’ve heard so many of these stories about pharmacompanies and industry and I want to stay in research it’s my passion. That’s not to say it doesn’t have a plethora of flaws. 

But don’t I owe it to myself to try? I’ve been in uni 8 years+ to get to this point I’ve worked so hard. I asked him if he could just support me in trying this for myself but he said ‘how could I support you leaving. You’re leaving your family and friends and everything else behind.’ I felt pretty frustrated at this point so i just turned around in bed and cried. There was nothing I could say or do to change his mind. 

I feel so guilty -I’m the one cause for his pain and in advocating for myself I’m not taking it away. I supported him for over a year with his new job even though it has awful working hours and I have felt so alone and ignored and 2nd best to it because he would say there’s nothing I can do this is my job I need this experience. And so I compromised and said I didn’t know what I would do in his situation either so I’ll try and support you. So I was really disappointed in the lack of support from him. 

So AITAH?","NTA

Don’t put a career off for what ifs. The what if he is the one. The what if of a family. Etc etc. 

I had a job opportunity on the other side of the states from me in a very remote part of the county. 3 hours away from an actual city. With no internet and limited phone calls. 

My husband supported me. 

Go, don’t hold back on your dreams. I hate to say it but relationships come and go. The best ones work at it even in hard times when the person isn’t right next to you. You learn to not take that together time for granted.",NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you're facing a challenging decision with a lot of different emotions involved. It's understandable to feel torn between an incredible career opportunity and the relationship with your boyfriend, especially when both are important to you. You're not an AH for wanting to pursue your dreams and build a career that you've worked hard for. It's natural to seek opportunities that align with your passion and professional goals. 

At the same time, it's clear that your relationship means a great deal to you, and you're navigating how to balance these two important parts of your life. It's commendable that you've supported your boyfriend in his job, and it's reasonable to hope for similar support in return. 

This situation calls for open, honest communication with your boyfriend. Exploring long-distance options or discussing how you both envision the future might be helpful. This is a significant decision and it's okay to feel conflicted. You deserve to pursue your dreams while also considering the impact on your relationship and finding a path that honors both.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on the dialog example and the situation described, here's my response:

You're not the asshole for wanting to pursue this incredible career opportunity. Your feelings of guilt are understandable, but they stem from caring deeply about your boyfriend, not from doing anything wrong. This is a classic case where there's no clear ""right"" answer - just difficult choices between competing priorities.

What stands out is that you've been transparent from the start about potentially needing to move for your career, and you've previously supported your boyfriend's career choices even when they impacted you negatively. The opportunity in America represents years of hard work and dedication to your field.

However, this is clearly an emotional situation for both of you. Instead of focusing on who's right or wrong, perhaps explore if there's room for compromise - could you commit to a specific timeframe in America? Could your boyfriend work remotely for his current company? Sometimes when we step back from the immediate emotional reaction, new possibilities emerge.

Remember: wanting to pursue your career dreams doesn't make you a bad person or partner.",NAH (No Assholes Here),"You sound torn between two important desires: pursuing your dream career and maintaining a relationship with someone you care deeply about. It's clear that you've worked hard to get to this point, and the opportunity in America feels like a once-in-a-lifetime chance. At the same time, you want to be with your boyfriend and have a future together.

It seems like you've been trying to find a balance between your own needs and his, but it's not working out. You're feeling guilty for causing him pain, but you're also feeling frustrated that he's not supporting you in pursuing your dreams.

I don't think you're being unreasonable for wanting to explore this opportunity. You've discussed the possibility of moving away with him before, and you're not asking him to make a drastic change without warning. However, it's also clear that he's not willing to make the sacrifices that would be required for you to pursue this opportunity.

It might be helpful to have a more nuanced conversation with him about what you both want and need from your relationship. It's possible that there are compromises that could work for both of you, but it's also possible that this is a deal-breaker. Either way, it's not about being ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but about finding a path forward that works for both of you.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re caught between a rare career wonder‑land and a partnership that’s been the bedrock of your life.

wcgj9o,aitah,"I decided that i wanted to have a little party since i haven't put on any kind of event in a long time. I got a nice hall and bands/dj's and decor and fun games etc for us all. It was a free private event (all the costs were out of pocket) but about 75 people were invited.  

I sent out the invites, everyone was super excited and so was i! I missed my friends and dancing and such. 

A week before the party i asked everyone to take a rapidtest to make sure nobody was showing up sick and spreading germs.  I didn't think it was a big deal to ask that. But apparently it was, i had about 30 people give me flack about, telling me i was unreasonable and that it was an invasion of their privacy. 
So i told them if they didn't want to do it thats there choice and i respect that but it meant they weren't invited to join us. But I also told them i would bring a bunch of tests incase someone changed their mind or didn't have time to hit up a drug store beforehand. In the end about 20 of those people refused to attent because of this. 
It still was a really fun night. But i was sad that those 20 people didn't come because of my request to do a test  before showing up. 

AITAH for this?","NTA - I can never get over why people are so scared, anti taking a simple test......... I have heard all the excuses and none of them make any sense. You chose this as a way of feeling/verifying safety, it is your choice and their to say no. Glad you had a good time. They were the losers in this case.",NTA,"NTA
In my opinion individual test results and “privacy” are less valued than the health of a group. However, you could have maybe asked them to show vaccine proof as an alternative because rapid tests can be hard to find and for some painful to take. Options could have been provided for masking and distancing too so more could have shown up and less blame would be placed onto you as the host. Overall not the asshole, but maybe work more with your guests next time to find alternatives so everyone can enjoy in a way they are comfortable.",NTA,"It sounds like you put a lot of effort into planning a wonderful event for your friends, and it’s understandable that you wanted to ensure everyone’s safety and comfort by asking for rapid tests. In today’s climate, health precautions can be a sensitive topic, and people's reactions can vary greatly. It seems you were trying to strike a balance between hosting a fun event and being considerate of everyone’s well-being, which shows you care about your friends.

While some may have seen the request as an inconvenience or an invasion of privacy, it was your prerogative as the host to set guidelines for your event. You provided options by offering tests at the venue, which reflects your flexibility and willingness to accommodate different perspectives. It’s unfortunate that some chose not to attend, but it’s important to remember that you did what you felt was best for the group. You’re not in the wrong for prioritizing health and safety, and it’s great that the event was still a success.",NTA,"I hear how much effort and care you put into planning this special event, and it's understandable you're feeling sad about some friends choosing not to attend. You were trying to create a safe, fun environment for everyone while being reasonable - even offering to provide tests for convenience.

You weren't forcing anyone to test - you gave people a choice and respected their decisions either way. The fact that you're questioning yourself and feeling concerned about those who didn't come shows you're thoughtful about others' feelings.

From what you've shared, you weren't being unreasonable. You invested your own time and money to host this event, and it's perfectly valid to set boundaries that help ensure everyone's wellbeing. While some friends disagreed with your request, many others understood and attended, resulting in what sounds like a wonderful celebration.

Try not to be too hard on yourself. You handled the situation respectfully while staying true to what you felt was important for the event's success and everyone's safety.",NTA,"It sounds like you were really looking forward to reconnecting with your friends and having a good time. You also wanted to take steps to ensure everyone's safety and well-being, which is understandable. When you asked guests to take a rapid test, you didn't seem to be trying to intrude on their privacy, but rather to create a safe environment for everyone.

It's not unreasonable to expect guests to take some basic precautions, especially when it comes to health and safety. By offering to provide tests for those who didn't have time to get one, you were also showing that you were willing to accommodate and support your guests.

In this situation, it seems like you were trying to find a balance between being a considerate host and respecting your guests' boundaries. While some people may have felt that your request was an overstep, it's also possible that they were being unreasonable in their expectations. So, no, I don't think you were the a**hole in this situation.",NTA,"It’s hard to say “AITA” because the core intent was to keep people safe, not to be spiteful. Asking for a rapid test before a gathering isn’t inherently unreasonable, especially when you’re covering all the costs and have a plan for people who don’t have one handy.

xb0hne,Am I the asshole for wanting to call husbands female coworker out?,"
My Husband has a female co worker who is making me extremely uncomfortable. (Not worried about my husband cheating). When I met her a few years ago she was asking my husband to hang out with me. I hung out with her two times and that was it. She made a catty comment about my hair and I was done at that point however more happened after that. She every once in a while asks me to go out and hang out with her but I always decline because at this point I’m uncomfortable. She out of nowhere made “hope Chests” for my kids which are apparently boxes with things like dishes, pots and pans for my kids when they turn 18 and move out. She also has referred to herself as Aunt to my kids. I feel like this is weird since we are not close to her. She has flirted with BOTH of my brother in laws (husbands brothers) and I learned a few months ago that she slept with one of them. She felt it was appropriate to tell my husband about it after he told her he was going to brother in law’s bachelor party and literally told him he was “top 3” 🤮. My brother in law said she basically started when he was sleeping and drunk. He didn’t want her but he didn’t stop her. She’s constantly oversharing with my husband. She’s told him how she wants multiple boyfriends outside of her relationship with her husband but her husband won’t let her. Also that her husband ignores her sexually to play video games and doesn’t please her. Now she is getting divorced from her husband and has told my husband she’s going to start an only fans to pay her bills. She has also said that her soon to be ex is all upset because she is already sleeping with people and the divorce isn’t finalized. She told my husband it’s not her exs Business who she’s sleeping with. Which is between them but like WHY are you telling all of this stuff to my husband?! Would I be the ass hole for calling her out? She’s crossed so many boundaries and I’m to the point where I just literally want to tell her to keep her distance from my husband kids and I and that she needs to stop telling my husband about her sex life. That I’m not interested in being her friend and that I don’t like her? It’s so frustrating to have him have to listen to this shit every day at work. I have a high suspicion she’s interested in my husband at this point. Also when I first met her she said that all of the other wife’s of the men she works with won’t hang out with her because they’re jealous of her and think that she’s trying to steal their husbands. Now I’m starting to understand why…",Pretty sure this is also on your husband. He should have set boundaries with her a long time ago. She's his coworker not yours. He should tell her she's being inappropriate and he doesn't want to hear these details and if she doesn't stop he'll go to HR.

It's important to communicate your feelings with your husband, ensuring that he understands your discomfort and concerns about his coworker's actions. He might be in a better position to set clear boundaries with her, considering they work together.

Before calling her out directly, consider discussing with your husband the best way to handle the situation together. Sometimes, a united front can be more effective in addressing uncomfortable situations like this. You both might decide that it's best for him to have a private conversation with her, asking her to respect your family's boundaries and to keep their interactions strictly professional.

- Making unwanted advances toward family members
- Oversharing intimate details with your husband
- Trying to establish an unwanted ""aunt"" role with your children
- Having a history of problematic interactions with other coworkers' wives

Instead of confronting her directly, which could create workplace drama for your husband, consider:
1. Having your husband set firm professional boundaries at work
2. Both of you limiting personal interaction with her
3. Being clear but polite if she reaches out - ""We prefer to keep relationships professional""

Your instincts about maintaining distance seem justified given her pattern of behavior. Focus on protecting your family's boundaries rather than engaging in direct conflict. Your husband should also consider documenting these interactions in case they become a workplace issue.

It's not necessarily about being the ""asshole"" for calling her out, but rather about being clear and direct about your boundaries. You have the right to communicate your discomfort and set limits on how much information you're willing to engage with.

1. **Set a clear boundary** – Tell your husband calmly that you’d like him to keep his office conversations professional and that you’re uncomfortable with the coworker’s personal disclosures.  
2. **Address the coworker directly, but politely** – You can say something like, “I’m not interested in a friendship beyond work. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t involve me in personal matters.”  
3. **Keep it about the behavior, not the person** – Focus on the specific actions that upset you (oversharing, flirtation, uninvited “hope chests”) rather than labeling her.

zwufdl,AITAH for debating on turning my mom in,"I’m sorry in advance, this will be all over the place since it’s a lot.
 I (22f) recently came to terms with the lie that I’ve been living. **There will be trigger warnings **My boyfriend (23m) has been trying to help me realize what’s been occurring the last two years but I have always been so desperate to have my mom that I couldn’t see it. It took her putting my life in danger once again for me to finally start opening my eyes and diving deeper into all of her manipulation and deception. 

Example 1: 
When I was five, my parents separated. From that point, my mom has filled my head with how awful of a person my dad was, there was never a time of us being together that she didn’t talk badly about him. She formed my perspective of my dad by doing so, anytime he’d mess up she’d feed off of that to pursue her agenda. I recently realized he was never the person she painted him out to be, she was mirroring everything she was doing onto him. 
She tried making me accuse him of r*ping me when he never did.

Example 2: 
When I was 7 I believe, she started dating a psychopath. He stalked us, ab*sed us, tried to k*ll us, tried kidnapping me, k*lled my rabbit, etc. she ended up losing custody of me. Mixed with all of the neglect she was doing, the dr*gs, and whatnot. 
He ended up going to prison. As soon as he was released(he was in for around 10 years), she was back in contact with him. She was in a relationship with him again in 2018 and I had told her to stop choosing bad guys over her kids or she’d eventually lose us. She always chose abusive or guys struggling with drug addiction over her kids. And I always forgave her and looked past that because I wanted a mom.

In 2020 she was being evicted from her house. My boyfriend and I decided to help her, we bought land together and a house, which she eventually got her own little house added onto the land. She immediately invited him over and manipulated me into believing that he was the only one who’d help with the water connection. She’s always had a way of painting herself as a victim and making others feel sorry for her. He tried stealing from us and she claimed she cut him off. Then in November of 2022 she picked up his dog to babysit and hid it from us. She finally admitted that she had his dog and was in contact with him again.
I finally realized she’ll always choose him over her kids. I realized how much danger that I am in with both of them.

Example 3: 
She manipulated me into helping her hide out. Ever since I was a kid she taught me that I needed to protect her. She owes over 35k to child support, she commits tax fraud and she lies about having a disability to receive additional income. 
She works 3-5 days a week cleaning houses and puts her checks in my name or has them pay in cash to hide that she makes an income. She convinced me to put her car and insurance in my name since she no longer could register it in her name due to child support debt.

Example 4:
She’s been living off of us all of 2022. She pays around $120 each month while we pay over $2,000 and we can’t afford it anymore. We pay her phone, her house, her car insurance, her dish, the water bill, the dog food (250 a month), etc. she’s drowning us while we’re trying to start our lives and doesn’t care.

At this point I feel like to stay safe I need to turn her in, I feel like she doesn’t care if I d*e or go to jail for her. But I still feel guilty for it. All I’ve ever done is protect her and keep her secrets and I don’t know how to not feel guilty for protecting myself finally.

That doesn't mean being rude and it doesn't make you a bad person to do so, it's just you protecting yourself from a toxic person. When someone shows you who they really are, believe them. Whether that ends up being good or bad.",NTA,"It sounds like you're going through a very difficult situation. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and betrayed by someone you considered a friend. Emily's actions had serious consequences for both you and your boyfriend, and it's natural to feel unable to just move past them easily. Healing from such an experience takes time, and it's important to prioritize your own mental and emotional well-being.

While your mom may want you to let it go for the sake of peace, it's crucial to acknowledge your feelings and process them at your own pace. Ignoring Emily might be your way of protecting yourself right now, and that's okay. However, it might be helpful to communicate your feelings to your mom, so she understands why you're acting this way.

Consider seeking support from a counselor or trusted adult who can help you navigate these emotions. Remember, you're not obligated to maintain a relationship with someone who has hurt you deeply, but finding a way to move forward that brings you peace is important.",NO_VERDICT,"I can hear how deeply this situation has affected you and your boyfriend. What Emily did - making a false accusation of sexual assault - was extremely serious and caused real harm to both of you, including social isolation, threats, and even physical violence. Your response of maintaining distance while avoiding escalation shows remarkable restraint.

It's understandable that your mother wants peace, but she may not fully grasp the severity of what happened. You're not being rude by protecting your mental health and maintaining boundaries with someone who deliberately tried to harm you and your boyfriend. The trauma from that experience is still fresh, and forcing yourself to interact with Emily could be retraumatizing.

You're not the asshole for keeping your distance. You're handling this maturely by not engaging in gossip or retaliation, while still protecting yourself. Consider explaining to your mom that while you don't wish Emily ill, the false accusation deeply affected your mental health and you need space to heal.",NTA,"It sounds like you're still carrying a lot of pain and hurt from what happened.

You've made it clear that you're not engaging in any hurtful behavior towards Emily, but rather, you're choosing not to engage with her at all. That's a valid response, especially given the extreme distress she caused you and your boyfriend. It's also understandable that you can't just 'let it go' as your mom suggested.

Ignoring someone isn’t inherently “rude”; it can be a coping strategy when the risk of further harm or emotional distress is high.

That said, you might consider a middle ground: set clear boundaries (e.g., “I’m not going to talk about this with you”) and then disengage. If Emily comes around, you can politely say you’re not ready to discuss it. If you find it hard to let go, a counselor or trusted teacher could help you process the trauma.

I have a pretty open schedule since I did graduate highschool early &amp; only work Monday- Friday 8-3. I stepped in to help with the baby. I picked him from school, fed him, bathe him, spent time with him, played with him etc. I even ordered him a few Christmas gifts. *I have always been active in this child’s life since the day me &amp; my bf got together. Just never really been active without my bf around if that makes sense* about 4 days ago my boyfriend came clean and told me the real reason why his bm isn’t in the babies life*I won’t get into detail but just know she caused physical harm to that baby he even showed proof of the hospital records and court documents*  

The bm found my instagram and engaged in a conversation with me. I was ofc respectful and had small talk back. She then asked me where me and the baby were going to be at later on today so she can come get him. I left her on read &amp; sent the message to my boyfriend he told me”you are his mom now. I don’t think she should see him but if you think it’s a good idea that it is fine” I thought about it for a second and told her it would be fine only if I was  present &amp; if we are in a public place. She started to get really hostile with me and started to disrespect me. I told her if this is the attitude that she has a grown women just because she can’t get her way then maybe she doesn’t need to see him at all. I told her to have a nice life and I then blocked her. 

I told the story to my Gma and she told me no matter what she carried this baby for 9 months not me. Told me no matter what she did to the baby I shouldn’t keep her away since I’m not the bio mom.

It sounds like you care deeply for your boyfriend’s child and are trying to make decisions in his best interest. It's important to remember that your boyfriend, as the custodial parent, has the ultimate say in who gets to see his child, particularly given the history with the biological mother. You’re stepping into a maternal role, and it’s clear you’re doing so with the child's welfare in mind.

Your grandmother’s perspective is valid in recognizing the biological mother's connection, but it’s crucial to prioritize the child's safety and well-being over biological ties, especially given past harm. Offering to meet in a public place with supervision was a reasonable compromise to ensure safety while considering her involvement. Her hostile reaction and your boyfriend’s support of your decision suggest you acted with caution and care.

4. The birth mother's hostile reaction validates concerns about her behavior

Your grandmother's perspective about biological connections, while common, doesn't override the child's safety and wellbeing. The birth mother lost her rights through her own actions, and legal custody rests with your boyfriend.

Your primary concern was protecting the child while still being open to supervised contact - this shows maturity and good judgment. When the birth mother became hostile, ending the conversation was appropriate. You're not keeping her away; she rejected a reasonable safety-conscious arrangement.

Trust your boyfriend's support of your decision. You're acting as a responsible caregiver putting the child's safety first.",NTA,"It sounds like you're struggling with a complex situation and receiving mixed feedback from those around you. On one hand, your grandmother suggests that as a non-biological mother, you shouldn't interfere with the biological mother's relationship with her child, regardless of her past actions. On the other hand, your boyfriend seems to appreciate your involvement and trusts your judgment.

It's essential to acknowledge that your actions were motivated by a desire to protect the child, given the biological mother's history of harm. By offering an alternative arrangement that included your presence and a public setting, you demonstrated a willingness to find a compromise. The biological mother's hostile reaction, however, raises concerns about her ability to prioritize the child's well-being.

In this context, it seems that you acted with the best interests of the child in mind, and your actions were not unjustified. You didn't entirely 'keep her away' but instead set boundaries that ensured the child's safety.

z21u9w,Am I the asshole for not wanting to communicate with my daughters “bonus mom”.,"TW: Sexual assault 

I spent 6 years of marriage to my daughters father being told he was a victim of sexual assault. It happened in high school when he was 18, and he was in therapy, had night mares, and struggled all around with it still in his late 20’s. I heard the story in detail multiple times, with him crying often. He’d vent about how ugly she was, tell me how awful of a parent she must have turned out to be, his mom would tell me what a crazy bitch she was. I just listened to him and helped him work through it how I could. 

There were issues in the relationship, and a lot of lying. To this day I don’t know much about who he really is. He lied about his religion multiple times, lied to get me to marry him….it was a mess. He’d even lie about simple things. There were more issues, but I won’t even open that door. It’s a novel. Needless to say I couldn’t stay with him any longer and fell out of love because of all the lies. I didn’t feel that the person I did love even existed, it was just lies upon lies. Now we share custody of our daughter. 

Just days after I broke up with him he was talking to the girl who SAed him. The same girl he had all the flashbacks about and hated. Now they’re together, and she’s my daughter’s “bonus mom” and tries to communicate with me about coparenting. He said he “set her straight” and things are fine now. His mom is very close with her and they all live together. 

I have no interest in talking to this woman. The entire situation makes me sick. I keep communication short. His mom keeps inviting me to family outings and I have nothing nice to say, so I stay quiet. Am I the asshole for being short with them and not doing family outings, etc, with our daughter? I just want them all away from me. They’re all acting like I’m crazy for not allowing them into my new life. I accepted its not my business, I just don’t want to like share Christmas dinner or go to brunch. As a victim of SA myself I’m so confused. But maybe people cope differently? If I’m being a jerk so be it. I’m just confused.","If this woman SA'd your husband, can you prevent her from being around your child?

Your feelings are completely valid, especially given the history you've described. It's understandable that you would want to maintain boundaries to protect your emotional well-being. The fact that your ex-partner is now involved with someone who was once the source of his trauma, and that this individual is now part of your daughter's life, can understandably be confusing and difficult to process.

It's important to prioritize your own mental health and establish boundaries that make you feel safe. Coparenting doesn't necessarily mean you have to engage in family activities or have a close relationship with your ex-partner's new partner. It’s okay to keep communication strictly about your daughter and to set limits on interactions that make you uncomfortable.

People cope with trauma in different ways, and while your ex may have reconciled with his past in a way that works for him, it doesn’t mean you have to change your boundaries. Trust your instincts and do what's best for you and your daughter. If you're feeling confused or overwhelmed, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist to help process these complex emotions.",NO_VERDICT,"I hear how deeply unsettling and confusing this situation is for you. It's completely understandable to feel betrayed and disturbed by the dramatic shift in your ex's story and behavior, especially given your own experience as an SA survivor. The fact that he spent years sharing detailed trauma accounts that now seem questionable, combined with his pattern of lying, would naturally make you wary of any further involvement beyond necessary co-parenting.

You're not being an asshole for maintaining firm boundaries. You don't owe them friendship or social engagement. Your priority is supporting your daughter while protecting your own mental health. Being civil and communicating about essential parenting matters is sufficient.

However, I would encourage you to document everything and consider speaking with a family therapist or legal professional about establishing clear co-parenting guidelines. This will help you navigate this complex situation in a way that's healthy for both you and your daughter.

Remember: Setting boundaries isn't being mean - it's taking care of yourself so you can be the best parent possible.",NTA,"You're struggling with a lot of conflicting emotions. On one hand, you seem to genuinely care about your daughter's well-being and want to maintain a healthy coparenting dynamic with her father. On the other hand, the situation involving his past and his relationship with the woman who assaulted him is incredibly sensitive and triggering for you, especially given your own experience as a victim of SA.

It's not about being the ""asshole"" or not; it's about setting boundaries to protect your own emotional well-being. You've been through a traumatic experience in your relationship with your daughter's father, and now you're being asked to engage with the person who caused him harm. It's reasonable to feel uneasy and reluctant to participate in family gatherings or open communication with her.

Rather than seeing this as a moral failing, perhaps it's an opportunity to acknowledge your own limits and prioritize self-care. It's okay to maintain a healthy distance and focus on your own healing. You can still be a supportive and loving mother to your daughter without feeling obligated to engage with her father's new partner or his family.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pain that’s spilling into every day. Your reaction is understandable—being around the person who’s tied to the trauma that still hurts you is a legitimate trigger. You’re not “the asshole”; you’re protecting yourself and your child from a painful, potentially damaging environment.

That said, your daughter will still need to know both parents (and the people who care for her) are involved in her life. The key is clear, firm boundaries. Write a short, respectful note to the ex‑husband explaining that you’re only willing to discuss co‑parenting matters, and that you’re not comfortable attending family outings or dinner events.

z9wdnu,AITAH for not wanting to give xmas gifts to son's ex stepkids?,"So here is the situation.  My son met a girl who had a child already.  They got married and had 2 kids.  Then wife cheated on my son, dumped him, and married another dude, had a kid with that dude.

THEN, she and my son cheated on her husband and she got pregnant , dumped her husband and she and my son had a 3rd kid together.  THEN  she dumped my son again and they have remained apart.

I have no relationship with any of the kids other than the 2 he had with her the first time.  I have not even met the younger 2,(one is his, one is not his).   Her son that she had before they got together, i have obviously met, but we have no relationship.   Both of the boys who are not my son's children have fairly wealthy and involved fathers and grandparents.   one of them even gets to go to disney once a year with is dad and the others dont. Both fathers and their families really load up those boys at xmas.

Now xmas is coming, and it been a really bad year financially for my husband and I.  Basically,  I dont want to buy xmas gifts for the 2 that are not my son's kids.   If  my son and their mother were together, i would consider them my grandkids,  EVEN though i dont really know them.

SO...  AITAH  for not wanting to consider them grandchildren and  not want to give them gift?  or should i just suck it up and buy them gifts?  I will note that i have provided xmas and birthday gifts for the past several years and have NEVER received a thank your or any type of acknowledgement  that they had received them.  I do not speak to their mother at all.

Edit:  I appreciate everyones feedback.  after talking with my son, who totally understands my viewpoint, i will be getting something for those two kids, because my sons says his ex  is so vindictive that she will be extra shitty and might not let him take the older two this summer if i dont.  I am trying to think of one big gift, but their ages are so spread out....16,  11, 10, 5 and 1.

I hope you recognize your son is 100% as at fault as anyone else in this scenario, so I truly hope you aren’t making your decision from some “moral high ground” perspective. As far as the issue at hand goes, if it was a tough year don’t buy presents for any of them. At the end of the day kids aren’t going to understand all the bs around who “is a grandchild” and who “isn’t a grandchild”, nor SHOULD they have to deal with any of that very adult drama and bullshit that their mom &amp; your son &amp; other baby daddy created. What they will understand, however, is how someone is buying their siblings gifts but for some reason has deemed them as less than or not worthy of a present. You don’t owe anyone gifts. They’re called gifts for a reason. But don’t inflict emotional distress on a child by playing favorites (again that’s how they’ll understand it) when you could just not give gifts, ESPECIALLY if you really can’t afford them anyway. The kids are innocent in this, even the ones who aren’t your “real” grandchildren. Just my thoughts. NAH though, at least you’re putting some genuine thought and concern into this

It's commendable that you've provided gifts in the past despite not receiving acknowledgment, which shows your generosity.

Given your update, it seems like your decision to get gifts for all the children is motivated by wanting to support your son and maintain his relationship with his children. This is a thoughtful and pragmatic approach, considering the potential repercussions. Perhaps focusing on meaningful, yet cost-effective gifts that could appeal to a range of ages might ease the financial burden.

The circumstances - including the lack of acknowledgment for past gifts and the fact that the other children have involved, wealthy fathers and grandparents - make your position understandable.

However, your son's insight about his ex's potential reaction is important to consider. Since this could affect his relationship with his biological children, a practical compromise might be best. Consider giving modest, age-appropriate gifts to all the children to keep the peace, while perhaps being more generous with your biological grandchildren privately.

For the age spread issue, you might consider gift cards or something universal like books, allowing each child to choose something appropriate for their age. This approach maintains family harmony while being mindful of your financial constraints.

Remember, you're not obligated to be equally involved with all the children, but sometimes a small gesture can prevent larger family conflicts.",NO_VERDICT,"You sound conflicted, on one hand, you didn't want to buy gifts for the two kids who aren't your son's biological children, but on the other, you're considering it due to the potential repercussions on your relationship with your own grandkids. It's clear that you're trying to navigate a complicated situation, especially given your strained relationship with their mother.

It seems like you care about maintaining a connection with your son and the kids he shares with his ex, even if it means being generous to the other two children as well. The fact that you provided gifts in the past without receiving any acknowledgement, yet still considered continuing the tradition, shows that you're not entirely opposed to showing kindness to these kids.

wrr2ea,AITA for telling a friend’s daughter she was eating too much cake and embarrassing her?,"My best friend Chloe is a very picky eater and it’s difficult to eat out together anywhere. She has sensory issues and struggles with the texture and taste of a lot of foods and so has a limited diet which she finds embarrassing. She’s reluctant to go out to restaurants for celebrations as she often eats off the children’s menu which draws attention to her. It was her 40th birthday a few weeks ago and she requested a low key celebration and as she doesn’t really like crowds or drink much alcohol it ruled out a lot of the usual birthday celebration ideas. I had the idea to do an afternoon tea party for her in my garden as it’s a large beautiful space and there was no pressure to eat off a menu as we could choose her favourite foods. I put bunting up in the garden and invited 10 of her closest friends and family, I organised games, mocktails, sangria and gin cocktails in teapots with tea cups instead of tea. 
For the afternoon tea we had plain cheese and egg mayo sandwiches on white bread instead of traditional cucumber or smoked salmon, salt and vinegar crisps, mini sausage rolls and quiches, chocolate eclairs and my friends mother baked a special birthday cake. 
On the day it was beautiful and sunny and we had lots of fun catching up and playing games, Chloe loved her surprise tea party. 
Everyone turned up but one of our friends also brought her 13 year old daughter “Becky” who was supposed to have been with her father for the day. Unfortunately he was unwell and as it wasn’t a rowdy party my friend said she had no choice but to bring Becky along. 
When we made the afternoon tea we made sure there was a lot of food to eat as some people were drinking which can cause them to be more hungry then usual and we thought it was better to do too much then too little. Unfortunately just having one extra person stretched it as Becky eats a lot! Everyone took a small plateful but Becky loaded her plate and then went back for another whilst everyone else was still nibbling their first. Chloe was so busy chatting with everyone that she was very slow at eating, by the time she went to get a sausage roll (her absolute favourite) they had gone. Becky had eaten 6! 
We brought the cake out and sang happy birthday and Chloe was moved to tears, she cut it up and managed to get it into 11 pieces and put it on the cake stand for everyone to take a piece. I was busy talking when a friend came over and discreetly mentioned Becky was on her third slice of cake. I was annoyed at this because it now meant some people weren’t going to get any, so I decided to ask her mum nicely if she could speak to her. Unfortunately I couldn’t see her mum anywhere so I thought I’d speak to Becky. One of the pieces of cake was untouched on her plate so I thought I’d ask her to put it back so someone else could try some. I approached her and said nicely that I was glad she was having a nice time but I explained there wasn’t enough cake for everyone now and asked her to put the slice back. I said I was worried Chloe wouldn’t get any like with the sausage rolls. She started to cry and said to her mum I’d called her a greedy pig when her mum came and saw us together, it made her mum very angry and she didn’t believe me when I denied that happened. After that they ended up leaving early which is a shame as up until then the day had been perfect and it made things a bit awkward. 
Since then a couple of people said I was in the wrong to approach Becky no matter how nicely but as she was at an adult party I tried to reason with her like one. AITA?","NTA...it would seem little Becky has a bit of an eating problem, mom is in denial of this (or the usual divorce guilt so she allows the child to do whatever they want so she doesn't end up liking daddy more, with the child having glommed on to this), and there's no shortage of people to help her in all this so as not to ""rock the boat."" This was unconscionably bad manners on the part of both mother and child. If I was you, I wouldn't just stand your ground, I'd go so far as to demand an apology from THEM, as well as from anyone who backed them up.

Your intention to address the issue discreetly and kindly shows that you cared about the balance of the party.

Perhaps, instead of addressing Becky directly, it might have been more effective to wait for her mother to return and discuss it with her privately. This could have avoided misunderstandings and maintained the festive atmosphere.

Speaking directly to a 13-year-old about their eating habits at a social gathering, no matter how politely done, risks causing embarrassment and emotional distress - which unfortunately happened here.

A better approach would have been to:
1. Wait to find Becky's mother
2. Quietly set aside portions for those who hadn't eaten yet
3. Make a general announcement about saving some cake for everyone

Teenagers can be especially sensitive about food and body image. Even well-intentioned comments can have unintended negative impacts. While you weren't trying to be hurtful, approaching her directly about her eating was likely embarrassing and potentially harmful to her self-esteem.

Moving forward, consider apologizing to both Becky and her mother, explaining your good intentions while acknowledging that your approach wasn't ideal.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you were trying to address a situation where you felt Becky was taking more than her fair share of cake and it might impact others, especially the birthday girl, Chloe. Your intention was to politely ask Becky to put the extra slice back, so others could have some.

However, it's clear that your approach, although well-intentioned, wasn't well-received. Becky felt embarrassed and hurt, which led to her leaving early with her mom. In hindsight, it might have been more effective to speak with Becky's mom first, as you initially intended, to address the issue.

Even though you didn't call Becky a ""greedy pig,"" it's possible that your words were perceived as critical or judgmental. Considering Becky's age (13), it's possible that she was more sensitive to your comments than an adult would be. It might be helpful to reflect on how you could have approached the situation differently, taking into account Becky's age and potential sensitivity.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you were trying to keep the party fair for everyone, but the way you handled it tipped the balance. Becky was a guest of her mother’s, and at a birthday you’re expected to treat everyone with the same courtesy as the host. Asking a child to “put the slice back” felt more like shaming than a gentle reminder, and the emotional fallout shows it didn’t land the way you intended. Chloe’s birthday was her day, and the gift of shared food is part of that celebration. In the future, a softer approach—perhaps offering extra slices or simply letting the kids finish their portions—might keep the vibe positive. A quick apology to Becky and her mom could also help smooth things over.",NO_VERDICT

However, responding with physical violence, even when provoked, isn't the right way to handle the situation. There were better ways to stand up for your sister, like firmly but calmly confronting your Tia about her cruel remarks, or simply focusing on supporting your sister in that vulnerable moment.

It's touching that your sister appreciated you standing up for her, but she's right that the slap wasn't appropriate. While your Tia was clearly in the wrong with her heartless comments, responding with violence only added more drama to an already emotional situation.

Consider apologizing to your Tia for the slap, while also expressing how hurtful her comments were. In the future, try to channel that protective energy into more constructive responses.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like a highly emotional and sensitive situation at your sister's quinceanera. I can understand why you'd feel protective of your sister, especially given the circumstances of her father's passing. However, slapping your Tia might not have been the most effective way to handle the situation. 

It seems like your Tia's comment was hurtful, but lashing out physically might have escalated the situation further. Your sister even thanked you but said you shouldn't have done that. This indicates that while your sister appreciated your intention to defend her, she might not have agreed with your method.

It's also worth considering that your mom and Abuela were already trying to comfort your sister, and your actions might have added more tension to the situation. Reflecting on how you could have handled it differently might help you navigate similar situations in the future.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like a really painful night for everyone, especially your sister. Slapping someone—no matter how upset you’re feeling—crosses a line that’s hard to justify. Even if you were defending your sister’s memory, a physical reaction can feel like a betrayal to her and to your mom, who is already worried about the fallout.

AITA? Most people would say yes, because you used violence when you could have spoken calmly or stepped away. That said, your frustration is understandable; your sister is grieving a lost parent and your aunt’s comment hit a raw spot.

Try to apologize to both your sister and your mom, and explain why you reacted the way you did. Ask your aunt to be more supportive next time. If you’re struggling with anger, consider speaking with a counselor or mediator to help you all navigate the family dynamics more peacefully.",NO_VERDICT
wnkedp,AITAH For kicking people out of my wedding?,"Me (23F) and my now husband (25M) got married last May. We had an elopement and after the honeymoon we had a picnic with all our families and friends to celebrate. I live in Utah and (I’m not sure if this is a thing in other states) but people usually announce their wedding publicly in social media and ask people to send their address for an invitation. It’s usually really open and even without an invitation, people can still go. I didn’t want that and neither did my husband so we announced our wedding without all the details (like date and place), but didn’t invite everyone to our celebration. 

The day of the celebration some people that weren’t invited assisted. Specifically 2 guys who used to be my friends when I first moved to Utah, but that cut me out of their lives over a year and a half ago, I was so confused and honestly very offended, too when they showed up, because they used to be my closest friends once but they didn’t think I was worth keeping in their lives. I tried so hard to not distance myself from them because they were supposed to be my best friends and at that time I didn’t know many people. 

When they stopped reaching out I decided to let them go if they wanted to, I was really lonely and sad, a couple months after was when I met my husband. Mind you that these guys weren’t part of my life for the whole time I dated my husband, never reached out to congratulate me on our engagement or when I announced our wedding. They just showed up with a group of mutual friends (the ones I did invite) saying they wanted to “surprise me” because it’s been so long since I saw them (these guys literally live in the same county as me, we haven’t seen each other because they didn’t want to). I was so mad, I told them “you and I aren’t friends, you can’t disappear out of someone’s life and come back whenever you want and call that a friendship. This isn’t a friends reunion, this is a private event and you weren’t invited. Please get out of here” I didn’t yell or made a scene, I kept my voice calm and told them that in private. 

I tried to be as polite and clear as I could so there weren’t any  misunderstandings, but some people that heard of what I did said I was rude and petty, and that they didn’t mean any harm by coming so I should’ve let them stay and have food. I’m so confused because if they weren’t invited, I think it’s rude on them to show up, but the only person that really defended me was my husband. So I need others’ opinions, was I the asshole?",NTA- it’s your event and they showed up uninvited. You shouldn’t have to feed them because they “showed up” fuck them.,NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you were put in a difficult situation, and your feelings are understandable. Your celebration was a special, private event meant to be shared with those who have been actively part of your life. It's natural to feel upset when people who had distanced themselves from you suddenly show up without an invitation, especially given your past efforts to maintain the friendship. Setting boundaries is important, and it seems you communicated your feelings calmly and clearly to them.

It's possible that those who criticized your decision might not fully understand the history and emotions involved. It's okay to prioritize your comfort and the atmosphere you wanted for your celebration. Remember, it's your event, and you have the right to decide who should be there. Your husband supporting you is a positive sign that you made the right choice for both of you. Trust your instincts and know that it's okay to stand up for yourself and your boundaries.",NTA,"Based on the situation you described, you were not the asshole. You handled an uncomfortable situation with grace and appropriate boundaries. Here's why:

1. This was your private celebration, not a public event, and you made that clear in your announcement
2. These individuals chose to distance themselves from you for over a year and a half
3. They showed up uninvited, which is generally considered poor etiquette for any private event
4. You addressed the situation privately and calmly, without causing a scene

Their claim of wanting to ""surprise you"" seems inconsiderate given the context of your relationship history. A wedding celebration is not the appropriate time to try to reconnect with someone you've previously cut off contact with.

While some might view your response as harsh, setting boundaries is important, especially on your special day. You shouldn't feel obligated to host people who weren't invited, particularly those who chose to remove themselves from your life during important moments leading up to your marriage.

Remember, it's okay to protect your space and peace during significant life events.",NTA,"You seem torn between feeling confident in your actions and being influenced by others' opinions that you were ""rude"" and ""petty."" It's clear that the situation with your former friends was complex and emotionally charged. You felt hurt and abandoned by their decision to cut you out of their lives, and their sudden reappearance at your private event triggered those feelings.

It's understandable that you wouldn't want to pretend like everything was fine when it wasn't. Your response to them, although direct, was calm and clear. You set a boundary and asserted your feelings in a private conversation. It's not about being ""rude"" or ""petty,"" but about standing up for yourself and your right to choose who attends your private event.

It's interesting that others are questioning your actions, but it's also telling that your husband defended you. It's possible that others didn't fully understand the context of your relationship with these former friends. You did what felt right to you in that moment, and that takes courage.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you were protecting a very personal celebration that you and your husband wanted to keep intimate. Your frustration is understandable—those two people had cut ties with you, and their “surprise” came at a time you had already decided to be selective about who could share that moment. 

You handled the situation calmly and set a clear boundary; that’s what you deserve. In a culture that often blurs the line between “public” and “private” weddings, expecting everyone to read the fine print can feel like a betrayal. Your husband’s support is a good sign that he sees your choice as reasonable. 

If you’re worried about future gatherings, consider a brief “please RSVP only” note or a direct message to those you truly want present. That way you can keep the intimacy you value while avoiding unwanted surprises.",NO_VERDICT
y0xty6,AITAH for getting in a school fight and breaking some kids nose?,"Hello! This happened last Friday and I feel horrible. I really do think I’m in the wrong here, so does my mom, but I really wanted a 3rd opinion.

I(F16) am a sophomore in highschool. I take IB courses, so advanced maths, science, etc. I’m a bigger girl, 5’10, and wear baggy clothes. I should note that I powerlift, my biggest deadlift being 120kg. Combined with the baggy clothes, I often appear more chubby than I am. 

This boy, J(M16) has been picking on me since middle school. I am openly bisexual,  and he seems to think that is funny. He calls me slurs in the halls, but normally behind my back. Whenever I catch him doing it I call him out, and I don’t hear from him for a day until it continues. Sometimes he will even prank call me, but he’s stopped doing that ever since I signed him up for multiple inappropriate sites.

The big issue started on Wednesday, when J got up in my face. Of course he’d never done this before, and I’m assuming he did it to “impress” his friends. My friends looked at him like he was crazy, and I asked him what he was doing and laughed. Embarrassed, he insulted me and called me fat. He’d never brought weight into our little showdowns, so I was surprised. He must’ve noticed, because he kept going. I just let him have it and walked away.

The next day I had no classes with J, but at lunch the slander continued. “You probably don’t need that,” He snickered behind my back where I was sitting. J treated his harassment like some kind of disney highschool bully. It was ridiculous. Me and my friends ignored the comment, shared glances and laughed it off.

Friday is where it got bad. I had been telling my mom about everything, and she told me to go see a principal. We are both very passive people, and don’t enjoy large fights or confrontation which is why I had been enduring this for so long. I arrive to school and before my class I head to the principal. I tell her what has been happening between me and J, and she says something about J being suspended before and how there is nothing to do. She offered to give him a detention, but there was no point.

Fast forward to lunch, me and my friends were going to a grocery store off school property. On the way there we see a big group of boys, a small amount being J and his friends. We lock eyes, but keep to our separate groups. I see him whisper something, and just before we arrive him and his friends split from their own group to walk behind us. 

They basically follow us around the store, and begin stepping on the back of our shoes. I am having no part of this, and turn around. “Can you guys stop doing that?” I say, trying to shut the whole thing down. But they continue. At this point, I am getting mad. They are stepping on me and my friends shoes, which(mine) were new and white. “Are you trying to get in a fight?” I ask J, trying my best to sound intimidating. J is about 6’2 and an average weight, so obviously he has a snarky comment to add about me. “I’m not trying to fight you over any chocolate, don’t get defensive,” he laughed, so did his friends. 

At this point he was a little too close for comfort, so I pushed him away. Notably, I should not have done this. It was in the heat of the moment, and we were in a public store. He pushes me back, and it quickly escalates. He throws the first punch, straight to my jaw, but realistically closer to my ear. I hear my friends ask me if I am okay, before punching him. It wasn’t one of those pity punches either, I really put my body weight into it. Swinging full force I made contact with his nose. My adrenaline quickly wore off, and I asked if he was okay, he pushed me away swearing. I saw bl//d dripping from his hand covered nose, and quickly got out of the store with my friends. 

I guess he didn’t tell anyone, because I haven’t gotten any calls home. Reddit, AITA?","I don’t normally think violence is okay….However he swung first. And I think it’s more than reasonable for you to defend yourself. In fact I’m appalled that he would try to hit a woman. It’s disgusting.

He has also been bullying you and trying to upset you. The body shaming, the rude comments, getting in your personal space, etc. He is a jackass. Hopefully you taught him a big lesson. 

Imagine he’d been doing this to someone more vulnerable than you? You seem very strong but you experienced how badly this behavior could affect someone. 

Stand tall and proud. And don’t ever take his $hit. 

NTA.

PS you just lived the fantasy revenge of thousands of bullied kids everywhere. 👏🏼",NTA,"A bloody nose is okay. If you broke it, he'd be down from the shock of the break, not pushing you away. He got embarrassed because you checked his attitude. You did good.

Since you aren't used to violence, understand this: broken body parts stop attackers, not cause them to push you (in your own words).",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're in a really difficult situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling conflicted about what happened. It seems like J's ongoing harassment has been incredibly frustrating and upsetting for you, and it's unfortunate that the school hasn't been able to effectively address the issue. While physical altercations are not ideal, it’s important to acknowledge that you were provoked and acted in the heat of the moment after enduring persistent bullying.

It might be helpful to reflect on alternative ways to handle such situations in the future, perhaps by involving trusted adults or seeking mediation through school resources. It’s also important to prioritize your safety and well-being. Consider speaking with a counselor or a mentor about the incident and your feelings, as they can offer support and guidance on navigating these challenging situations.

Remember, acknowledging your feelings and seeking support is a positive step forward. You’re not alone, and there are people who can help you work through these experiences.",NO_VERDICT,"Let me break this down carefully. While violence typically isn't the answer, you were in a situation where you:
1. Tried reporting the harassment through proper channels (principal)
2. Attempted to verbally de-escalate multiple times
3. Were physically followed and harassed off school grounds
4. Were physically assaulted first (he threw the first punch)

You acted in self-defense after being verbally harassed, stalked, and physically attacked. While breaking his nose wasn't ideal, you were defending yourself from someone who had been bullying you for years and escalated to physical violence.

The fact that you immediately asked if he was okay shows you're not naturally aggressive. You tried multiple peaceful solutions before this incident. Your mom's right that fighting isn't great, but you were backed into a corner after exhausting other options.

My suggestion would be to document everything in case this comes back up later, but no, you're NTA for defending yourself when someone else initiated physical violence.",NTA,"I can sense the frustration and anger you felt during the whole ordeal, especially with J's constant harassment and bullying. It's completely understandable that you'd want to defend yourself and your friends. However, taking a step back, it's clear that pushing J initially escalated the situation, and punching him in response to his punch wasn't the best choice either.

Considering your powerlifting background and the fact that you ""really put your body weight into it,"" it's no surprise that J's nose got broken. While I'm not excusing J's behavior, I think you can acknowledge that physical violence isn't the best solution, especially in a public setting.

It's great that you've been talking to your mom about this and she suggested going to the principal, but it's unfortunate that the principal didn't take more action. In hindsight, maybe exploring other options, like talking to a trusted teacher or counselor, could have helped resolve the situation without resorting to physical violence.

In the context of the situation, I'd say you're not entirely in the wrong, but you did contribute to the escalation. It might be helpful to reflect on how you can handle similar situations in the future, perhaps by finding more effective ways to address the bullying and harassment.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’ve been dealing with relentless harassment, and that’s a huge emotional burden. From what you described, J initiated the physical contact—he threw a punch first—so the fight was provoked. Your response was a reflex to protect yourself, especially after years of being bullied. Pushing him back was a natural reaction, but the subsequent punch you landed was a retaliatory act that caused him injury. In short, you were partly responsible for escalating the situation, but you were also reacting to a real threat. The school’s response (suspension notice, detention offer) seems limited; you might want to file a formal complaint or involve a counselor or student‑services office. For now, document what happened, get medical attention if needed, and keep a record of the bullying incidents. You’re not “bad” for defending yourself—just be prepared to explain the context if you’re asked.",NO_VERDICT
vul1ek,aitah for wanting my husband to keep guns in a safe when we have kids?,"context: i (18f) lost my dad to gun violence (suicide) when i was 3 years old. i too struggle with suicidal ideation and do not trust myself near firearms. my (19m) husband (long story) is aware of this. it should also be known my husband wants to join the army (i dont exactly agree with this career choice but im not gonna stop him from doing it). now for the story.

this argument happened a few nights ago when we were discussing guns. my husband said he wanted to raise our kids around guns. i said no way. i asked him to please keep his guns in a safe while our kids (non existent yet) are little due to the fact that it only takes one wrong move to hurt themselves or someone else. he said i was being ridiculous. i even offered to buy him a gun safe only he has the password to. he didnt like that either. he said he would just take our kids to the range and HIDE IT FROM ME. i was livid. he wants to keep his guns out in the open but i just dont think its safe for me or the kids. the argument has died down since but it still angers me when i think about what he said. so i decided to come to reddit for second opinions. so reddit, please tell me if im being crazy. i think its a reasonable request but he is inclined to disagree.",NTA.  ALL guns should be kept in a gun safe or otherwise secured. End of argument.,NTA,"NAH

I understand your fear of firearms, but your husband is also right. Teaching kids gun safety is *important* if you're going to have guns in the house, even when you have a safe. Crap happens even when you're careful. Kids need to know guns aren't a toy. If you hide the guns from your kids, you risk them thinking they're taboo and it's possible they'll be determined to mess with them because you said not to... because they're kids and kids are dumb. But when kids are around guns, they become boring and they're less likely to mess with them unsupervised",NAH,"It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, balancing your own history and concerns with your husband's perspective. Wanting to ensure safety by keeping guns in a safe, especially with your personal experiences and struggles, is a completely valid and responsible approach. Your concern for future children's safety is not only reasonable but also a common one for many parents. It's important to have open and honest discussions with your husband about these concerns, emphasizing that your request isn't about undermining his interests but about creating a safe environment for your family. It might help to explore more about safe gun ownership practices together, possibly even involving a third party like a counselor or an expert in firearm safety. This could foster a mutual understanding and help both of you reach a compromise that respects both your values and concerns. Remember, your feelings and experiences are valid, and seeking a safe environment for your family is a commendable goal.",NO_VERDICT,"I hear how deeply personal and concerning this situation is for you, especially given your traumatic experience with your father and your own mental health challenges. You're not being unreasonable at all - wanting to safely store firearms when children are present is both responsible parenting and standard gun safety practice.

Your husband's response to hide gun activities from you is particularly concerning, as it shows a lack of respect for both your experiences and your role as a future parent. This isn't just about differing opinions - it's about basic safety and trust in your marriage.

Given your history with suicidal ideation and guns, along with the future safety of your children, this is a serious issue that deserves proper attention. I would strongly encourage you both to discuss this with a couples counselor who can help navigate this sensitive topic. You might also benefit from speaking with a mental health professional individually about your concerns.

Remember, advocating for gun safety doesn't make you ""crazy"" - it makes you a responsible parent and partner.",NTA,"It sounds like this conversation has brought up a lot of emotions and concerns for you, particularly given your personal history with gun violence and your struggles with suicidal ideation. It's completely understandable that you would want to prioritize safety, especially when it comes to your future children. 

It seems like your husband's desire to introduce your children to guns is important to him, possibly due to his aspirations to join the army. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that your feelings and concerns are valid too. You're not being ""crazy"" for wanting to ensure a safe environment for your family. In fact, your willingness to find a compromise, such as offering to buy a gun safe, shows that you're trying to find a middle ground.

It might be helpful to have a follow-up conversation with your husband, where you both can share your perspectives and work together to find a solution that addresses both of your concerns. Perhaps you can explore alternative ways for him to teach your children about gun safety and responsibility that also prioritize your need for a safe environment.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re standing on a very emotional and traumatic line. Losing your dad to gun violence and dealing with your own suicidal thoughts gives you a clear, visceral sense of how dangerous firearms can be in a home with children. That perspective isn’t “crazy”—it’s a legitimate safety concern rooted in lived experience.

Your husband’s desire to expose kids to guns is understandable if he sees them as training or values, but it clashes with your right to feel safe. You could propose a compromise: keep the guns in a lock‑box that only he knows the code to, and agree on strict “no‑kids‑near‑guns” rules. If he refuses, you might need to set boundaries—perhaps even a temporary separation of firearms until you both feel secure. It’s okay to prioritize your mental health and your future children’s safety.",NO_VERDICT

The pattern you describe of lectures turning into fights, and his attempt to shift blame back to you even after apologizing, suggests this may be part of a larger dynamic of control and emotional manipulation. Your instinct to not want to stay there anymore is worth paying attention to - it's your gut telling you something isn't right.

I would normally just assume it was an accident and correct her but the school year is almost over and she hasn’t even bothered to learn my name and acts annoyed when I correct her. Yesterday, she called me by my sisters name AGAIN, and at this point I really think she’s doing it just to bother me. So I raised my had and said “Ms. Ava do you have any sisters?” she told me she did have one so I asked “What is her name?” “Mary” She responded . The next 10 minutes of class went on until I had a question, “Ms. Mary I don’t understand can you help me?” I said. She was furious. She started telling me how disrespectful it was to purposely call her another name just for the sake of being petty, she then told me that I would have 10 points subtracted from my homework for calling her Mary. I told her it wasn’t fair how she always called me my sister’s name on purpose but now that I do it I get punished. She told me that it was different because she was older than me and that if I didn’t stop talking back she would send me to the principals office.

He lies to get out of trouble. He gets less than great marks on his conduct reports. He breaks things. He takes things without asking. He's forgetful. He's easily distracted. 

While I know he sounds like a terror,  he's also super sweet and generous and funny and empathetic and creative... I love the kid to death. I mean, he's my son...  His behavior improves when he is on his medication, but it's not perfect. I don't expect that of a 10 year old boy. 

I tend to let small things slide. Or, at least, what I think is small. Like if Jason isn't watching what he's doing and knocks something over or spills something, forgets what he was asked to do, etc. I believe in ""pick your battles"".  Especially when he is not on his medication. Bigger problems get bigger consequences, of course. I have ADHD myself and try to gain as much information on the subject as possible to try and understand myself and my son better. I get the struggles he faces. My husband, we'll call him Jerry, thinks I use it as an excuse and that I am not being supportive of him when I offer suggestions as to why or why not our son may have done something. Or maybe  it was just an accident or a mistake, or he didn't know better. I don't say these things in front of our son because I don't want to undermine my husband.

Jerry thinks the best way to discipline Jason is to ""change his life"" by spanking or breaking his things. Jason agrees that breaking his things makes him remember the lesson, but I'm of the position that a 10 year old can't be completely sure what type of discipline he actually needs. I also don't care for spanking, and I'm totally against breaking a child's possessions. 

I took Jason's phone away as a consequence. Jerry keeps allowing him to have it when I'm not around. I complained to Jerry about this, and he basically shrugged it off. 

As another consequence, Jerry took all of Jason's personal belongings out of his room. He was going to smash his TV, but I stopped him. He was upset that I did and claimed I wasn't backing him up.

Jerry also doesn't like the fact that I disagree with his decision not to  allow Jason to have his Christmas  presents this year. He told me to ask my mom's opinion, and she disagreed too. So, naturally, my mom and I are both wrong.

Today, Jerry found an old cellphone in a kitchen drawer. I had seen the phone in the drawer a while ago. Jerry told me that Jason had taken it from another location and had planned on playing with it since his phone had been taken away. I didn't know that Jerry had removed it from the kitchen drawer and put it somewhere else, so I told him Jason must not have moved it recently because I had seen it in the kitchen. 

Jerry took this as me defending Jason. It took us getting into an argument about it for him to finally tell me that he had actually moved it from the kitchen and into the other room, and then Jason moved it back. I told him he should have said that before. He accused me of nitpicking what he said and told me he shouldn't have to explain himself. If he says Jason did something, I should just believe him and ""tear his ass up"" without asking questions. He says a wife wouldn't question her husband. He also said our son was narcissistic and that I needed to choose between the two of them because he ""can't live like this."" Also, I'm the reason our son acts this way because I let it happen. It's not because of ADHD,  etc.

Jerry also tasked Jason with vacuuming, and the vacuum stopped working. A small copper wire that gets power to the motor broke. Jerry thinks it's because Jason pulled the power cord too hard while it was full (shop vac full of water), and it twisted the motor inside enough to break the wire. I said I didn't think so. That, of course, was me defending Jason again.

There is so much more I could say... there have been so many arguments between us about our son. I'm at a loss. Ask me anything. I don't mind answering questions if it helps gain understanding. I am also willing to accept criticism if I'm in the wrong. I really want to know, honestly. I want to do whatever I can to fix my family.


Edit to answer a couple of questions:
1. Yes, he is his biological father.

2. When I say Jason breaks things, I mean he is not careful. I'm not saying he does it on purpose.

3. The pharmacy here frequently is out of stock of Jason's medication and mine. It sometimes takes a couple of weeks before they get a shipment. I'm currently trying to find another nearby that might keep the meds stocked, but I've had no luck yet.

4. When I say I let little things slide, I don't mean I just ignore it, and he gets away with it. I'm saying I don't make a huge deal if he, for example, trips over his own feet and spills his drink. If he were to just straight up pour it on the floor, that would be another thing altogether. That's not something he would do, though.

5. To the person who said my son seems like a ""nightmare"" to everyone but me, that is simply not true. He's honestly a great kid. He's not mean spirited or violent or anything like that. 

6. His negative conduct grades are mainly because of his inability to sit still in his seat and be quiet.

7. One of the reasons I made this post was to prove the point to my husband that I am not the only one who thinks the way I do and to let him see that he is being an asshole.

8. Yes, my husband had a SHIT childhood, and I believe he has a lot of trauma to work through. I've been trying to convince him to seek help. Both his parents and his stepfather all did some pretty messed up stuff to him as a child and both of us as adults. His real father died when he was 16. We cut his mother and stepfather out of our lives 3 years ago. Which is when his mental health seemed to start declining. He has no family left but us.

9. I will do everything I can to protect my son and will do whatever I have to. I already know this shit ain't right.

10. I don't think I explained the phone thing properly. Jason did exactly what Jerry said he did. The thing was that Jerry had left out a bit of important information which made me think he was wrong and he thought I didn't need to know that detail because I should have just believed him in the first place. Sometimes, he thinks Jason has done something wrong, and he is wrong. I don't like to blame a child for something by just assuming they did it without getting all the facts first. Jerry usually assumes the worst. No one wants to be punished for something they didn't do.

11. I might not have explained properly. I don't  excuse his behavioral issues. I just believe there are different levels to the amount of discipline needed for different behaviors.

12. I told my husband in response to the ultimatum t ""Our son isn't going anywhere, so... you do what you gotta do."" I would never have chosen any different. He said he didn't mean it like that.","Spanking a 10 yr old boy with ADHD and breaking his things is not discipline, it’s retaliation. No at all OK.",NO_VERDICT,"Both the AH
My son(31) has ADHD. During his elementary and middle school years I followed the recommendations of his counselor and read a book called “1-2-3 magic”. I laughed as I read it because I knew it wouldn’work but I did what it recommended anyway. It really was magic and extremely helpful in disciplining my son. I loosened up in high school and let my son have a little more freedom. He did not do well in high school but he did graduate. He got back on his meds and held himself accountable and he graduated college and is a successful adult. He told me after all this that in high school most of his bad grades were from being lazy. He said his ADHD only had a little to do with it. Remember, not only does your son have ADHD, he has a mom that enables the lazy boy.",ESH,"It sounds like you're in a challenging situation where you're trying to balance understanding and discipline for your son. It's clear you deeply care about Jason and want to ensure he's treated fairly, considering his ADHD. Your approach of gathering all the facts before disciplining shows your commitment to being just and supportive. It’s important to recognize that ADHD can affect behavior and impulse control, and you’re doing well by educating yourself and trying to understand his struggles.

Your husband’s approach seems rooted in his past experiences, which may be affecting his perspective on discipline. It's crucial for both of you to communicate openly and perhaps seek a professional who can mediate and provide guidance on effective parenting strategies for children with ADHD. This can help both of you find common ground and avoid conflicts that may arise from differing viewpoints.

Ultimately, you’re not an AH for wanting to ensure fairness in discipline. Prioritizing your son's well-being and advocating for understanding, while also addressing problematic behaviors, is a balanced approach. Consider seeking family counseling to support your family dynamics and work towards a healthier environment for all of you.",NTA,"Based on the dialog provided, I'll aim to respond with empathy while addressing the serious concerns raised:

I hear how much you care about both your son and your husband, but there are some very concerning behaviors here. Your instinct to gather facts and use appropriate, measured discipline for a child with ADHD is spot-on. Breaking possessions, excessive physical punishment, and withholding Christmas presents are forms of emotional abuse that can cause lasting trauma.

Your husband's ultimatum to ""choose between them"" and insistence that ""a wife wouldn't question her husband"" reveals controlling behavior that's harmful to both you and Jason. While your husband's own childhood trauma may explain his actions, it doesn't excuse them.

You're not wrong for protecting your son and using evidence-based parenting approaches. I strongly encourage you to:
1. Document these incidents
2. Seek family counseling
3. Create a safety plan
4. Consult with professionals who understand ADHD and family dynamics

Your son needs you to continue being his advocate. Your measured approach isn't enabling - it's good parenting that considers his developmental needs and challenges.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're deeply conflicted and concerned about the dynamic between you, your husband, and your son. I sense that you're trying to balance being understanding and empathetic towards Jason's ADHD challenges while also setting boundaries and discipline.

One thing that stands out to me is the difference in approach between you and your husband. You seem to be more focused on understanding the context and nuances of Jason's behavior, while your husband appears to be more punitive and reactive. This difference in approach is causing tension and conflict between you two.

I also notice that your husband's past trauma and upbringing may be influencing his parenting style and reactions. It's possible that he's struggling with his own emotional regulation and may benefit from seeking professional help to work through his trauma.

I want to acknowledge that you're not excusing Jason's behavior, but rather trying to understand the complexities of his ADHD and respond in a way that's supportive and constructive. It's great that you're willing to listen to criticism and explore ways to improve your family dynamics.

Can you tell me more about how you feel your husband's behavior is affecting Jason, and what you think would be the most helpful way for your husband to support Jason's needs?",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you and Jerry are both trying hard to protect Jason, but the lack of a shared language is turning good intentions into frustration. When he says “just believe him,” that’s a shortcut to conflict, not a solution. The first step is a small, concrete agreement: each of you will share the full facts before deciding on a consequence. For example, if Jason takes a phone, you both write down “where it was found,” “who moved it,” and “what Jason said.” Then you jointly pick a consequence that fits the behavior—phone time‑out, extra chores, etc. Consistency matters more than the type of discipline; a predictable routine helps a 10‑year‑old with ADHD.

Also, a couple of quick ideas:

1. **Co‑parenting contract** – a brief, written plan you both sign that spells out discipline, tech limits, and how you’ll handle disagreements.  
2. **Professional support** – a family therapist or a parenting coach can help you both stay on the same page and process Jerry’s",NO_VERDICT
zquh95,AITA for not wanting to spend Christmas with my husbands family?,"I (25F) and my husband (28M) had a huge fight over Christmas planning this year. For context, we have spent EVERY holiday with his family for almost 3 years straight (almost the entire duration of our relationship) and have a one year old child. I’ve never had an issue spending holidays with his family since my family isn’t much on having dinners/celebrating the holiday; however, my family has mentioned several times they would still like to see us on holidays as well. 
This year for Christmas, I decided I wanted to visit my grandmother, my mom and my dad (they are divorced, so two separate visits) on Christmas Eve and then spend Christmas Day with my husbands family. The issue is, my MIL is disappointed that we will be missing his grandparents Christmas Eve dinner because we will be with my family. It has caused a fight. We will be having a huge Christmas breakfast with the same grandparents and my in laws on Christmas morning, so I felt it was only fair to skip their Christmas Eve dinner to spend that time with my family since we will be seeing them on Christmas Day. 
My MIL is texting my husband telling him that we need to “do the right thing” and isn’t happy with us (mainly me) over this. My husband agrees that we need to spend time with my family, but he is still trying to cut out my family time so we can make it to his grandparents on Christmas Eve (again, the same grandparents we will be seeing on Christmas Day). 
So, AITA for being upset over this? Is it wrong for me to want a day with my family and a day with his?","NTA… I would tell your husband that if he wants to go to Christmas Eve to his family then you will be spending Christmas Day with your family. Compromise is the key to a healthy relationship, tell hubby dear that your family deserves just as much time with you and baby as his family does. Millions of other married couples split holidays. It’s a part of life. MIL will just have to deal. She has been spoiled by your past Christmas’. I would lay in the guilt about your aging grandma lol",NTA,NTA why not go to your family on Xmas and the in-laws grandparents if it’s that important?,NTA,"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, trying to balance family expectations during the holidays. It's understandable that you want to spend time with your family, especially since you've primarily spent holidays with your husband's family in the past. It seems like you're making an effort to be fair by splitting the holiday between both families.

Feeling upset about this situation is natural, as you're trying to honor your family's wishes while also respecting your husband's family traditions. It’s important to communicate openly with your husband about how you’re feeling and work together to find a solution that considers both families' needs. Perhaps having an honest conversation with your MIL about your intentions and desire to maintain family balance might help ease the tension.

Ultimately, wanting to spend time with your family doesn't make you the antagonist. It's about finding a way to compromise and ensure that both families feel valued and included during the holiday season.",NO_VERDICT,"Your feelings are completely valid, and you're proposing a very reasonable compromise. It's natural and fair to want to split holiday time between both families, especially now that you have a child who should have the opportunity to build relationships with all their grandparents and extended family.

The fact that you've spent every holiday with your husband's family for three years shows you've been very accommodating. Your MIL's reaction and attempt to pressure your husband suggests she may be struggling with sharing family time, but that doesn't make her response appropriate or fair to you.

You're not being selfish by wanting to establish a more balanced holiday arrangement. Many couples face this challenge, and splitting celebrations between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day is a common and practical solution. Your husband's support of sharing time is positive, though he might need to be firmer in standing up to his family's expectations.

Remember, setting healthy boundaries now will help establish sustainable family traditions for years to come.",NTA,"It sounds like you're feeling caught in the middle of trying to navigate both your family's and your husband's family's expectations.

It seems like you're trying to find a compromise by visiting your family on Christmas Eve and still spending Christmas Day with his family. 

I sense that you're feeling frustrated and possibly even a bit guilty for wanting to prioritize your own family's needs. It's understandable that you'd want to spend quality time with your parents and grandmother, especially since they've expressed their desire to see you on holidays. It doesn't seem unreasonable to want to split your time between both families, especially since you'll still be seeing his grandparents on Christmas Day. It's worth exploring this further with your husband to understand why he's feeling the need to cut out your family time and to find a solution that works for both of you.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re juggling a lot of feelings—love for both families, a toddler’s schedule, and the pressure of expectations. You’re not just “acting” against your husband; you’re trying to honor commitments to your own parents and make space for your little one’s first Christmas moments. It’s understandable that your MIL feels hurt when a tradition is altered, especially when the same grandparents will meet you later. Your husband’s support for your family time shows he cares, yet he’s also balancing his side’s expectations. The key is to frame the day as a *shared* holiday rather than a “missed” one. For example, propose a joint breakfast or a small family photo session on the day you’re with your parents, and let your husband know you’ll still celebrate with his family on Christmas Day. Open, calm conversation—acknowledge both sides’ emotions—can help shift the fight into a practical compromise that honors everyone’s needs.",NO_VERDICT
xu9tr7,AITA for ruining my brothers relationship?,"last year my brother announced he had a new girlfriend, this wasn't a big deal since he had a new one every other month, but he told us he was bringing her to my uncles birthday so we could meet her because he planned on marrying her. We laughed at him but he seemed determined so we let it go. My dad poked fun at him but admitted he wanted to meet the woman that finally tamed his wild middle child. fast forward to the party and everyone is anxious to meet the girlfriend. We had just finished cutting the cake when my brother showed up with two girls, a short chubby one who looked to be in her late 30's and a skinny younger one. immediately the family greets them and we all assume they are mother and daughter so we refer our attention to the chubby woman. after a few moments my brother quiets everyone down and apologizes to the chubby girl and explains that the two women are sisters and that the younger one is his girlfriend.

there was a moment of awkward silence until my dad started laughing and walked over to my brother making a big scene about how that was his son and how big he scored getting a younger woman. Some relatives cheered him on and others just murmured in confusion. this girl seemed too young to even drive so I asked her for her age. My brother started brushing me off saying it didn't matter and that love was love but the girlfriend told him it wasn't a big deal. my brother was 28, this girl was 15!

Everyone lost their minds. I let my brother know this was so wrong in so many levels and that he was a predator. My dad stepped between us and demanded I apologized, I refused and told the girlfriend's sister she was a predator too for letting this happen. My dad slapped me, the party fell silent and my dad started ranting about how he married my mom when he was 22 and she was 15 and that it was normal for men to want younger women. I yelled back that my mother was miserable till the day she died and that if he thought that an adult dating a child was normal he was sick. my dad almost slap me again when my auntie, his sister, yelled back that it was true and that she, like my mom, was unhappy and wished someone had intervened before her marriage (she was 16 when she married her 30 y/o husband).

Her husband gets up, grabs her by the arm and demands to know what she's talking about, one of my other uncles starts defending my auntie and pulls her away. Everyone starts arguing, a fight breaks out, cops show up, EMTs are called. Four were arrested, three hospitalized, one divorced and multiple people cut ties with one another. My dad kicked me out and hasn't spoken to me since.

multiple people have reached out, blaming me for ruining my uncles birthday, for the feuds that have started, for my aunties divorce and for my brothers relationship breaking apart a few days later. I really don't think I'm the asshole, my brother is a fully grown man and she is a child who hasn't finishes puberty, AITA?

TLTR: 28 y/o brother presents his 15 y/o girlfriend to the family, family is morally divided, fight breaks out, people go to jail and the ER, uncle gets divorced, I'm blamed for everything. Why? bc I asked her age.

You're not responsible for the chaos that unfolded. The reactions from your family members - the violence, the revelations about past abuse, the divorces - those were all choices made by adults dealing with their own complex histories and moral standings.

By asking her age, you brought attention to the power imbalance and age inappropriateness of the relationship.

It's concerning that your family didn't immediately recognize the issue and instead turned on you.

z2u5dd,AITA for withholding sex after my boyfriend didn't get me a 30th birthday present.,"Hi, this is my first post so bare with me, a few things for context. My boyfriend earns less than I do hourly rate but takes home more because of overtime. I planned a suprise 30th birthday party for him which cost roughly £500 and bought him a big table saw thingy which cost roughly £60.

So I recently turned 30, I love being on holiday so I thought if I have to turn 30 why not do it on a beach. So about a year ago I booked for myself and my partner to go to mexico. We each paid half in installments as my boyfriend didn't have any savings. I tell my boyfriend to start putting some money aside so he'll have some spending money. (This is relevant later).  So the week before we go to mexico I say to my boyfriend about getting some pesos. He says he only has £100 in his bank and he needs this for his MOT on his car. So I agree to use our joint account money which is for house stuff, like groceries and bills. I ask why he didn't save any money for mexico especially as he has been doing lots of overtime. He says he didn't get paid a lot the month before so he had to use the money he saved for mexico for everyday stuff like petrol. So this annoyed me a bit as he had a year to prepare and I specifically told him to put money aside each month, but I let it go and we went to mexico. Everything was going great, we had to be a bit more cautious than I would have liked due to the money issue. I didn't get to go to the mayan pyramids but hopefully I can go back one day and do this. So we see these people having dinner on the beach at sunset with fire torches and I say to my bf how romantic that would be and that I expect it gets booked up fast so if we wanted to do it we should speak to reception sooner rather than later. I was hoping he would take the hint and ask about doing this on my birthday to make the day really special. I had already arranged for us to go swimming with dolphins that day as it was something I have always wanted to do and my bf hadn't arranged anything. So on the day I woke up opened up my cards from friends and family, my bf got me a nice card but not what I would say was special. It didn't have 30 on it or wasn't a photo card, or didn't have a heartfelt message written in it. Just said happy birthday love you from boyfriend. There wasn't any present, which wasn't an issue I thought maybe he had got us an experience like diving or dinner on the beach like I had suggested. I would have been happy with anything like that as its the thought and effort that counts not an item or how much its worth. So we swim with dolphins and have an amazing time, get back to our hotel and get ready for dinner, i dress up extra nice incase he has anything special planned. He asks me where i want to go for dinner, our hotel had 3 restaurants although the food wasn't that great. I'm a bit suprised as I thought he had booked the beach dinner. I say I don't mind and let him pick thinking he'll say suprise and say we're going somewhere nice. He didn't. He made zero effort, none. He didn't even ask the hotel staff to sing happy birthday or bring decorations for the room. I was so disappointed, I wasn't expecting him to buy me an expensive gift as I know he struggles to save money. I just wanted him to make a tiny bit of effort. He then spent the rest of the evening downing free beer after free beer and getting drunk. When we got back to our room he started coming on to me and whispered in my ear happy birthday like it was something sexy. I have never been so turned off in all my life and told him I wasn't having sex with him. He got mad and asked why we couldn't have special birthday sex. I asked him why he hadn't made any effort for me on my special day. He said he didn't have the money to buy me a gift and he spoke to the receptionist that morning but that the beach dinner was booked that night. I asked him why he didn't book it earlier in the week or arrange for us to go out for dinner to a restaurant outside the hotel, or arrange a trip. He said he didn't think of it until the day, and didn't think I would want to eat out when we had paid for all inclusive. I went to bed early and felt really disappointed. The next morning I woke up and my bf wasn't speaking to me, so it made me think AITA?","NTA,
because you don't owe sex to anyone.
But I severely recommend you to communicate your needs more clearly, ie ""I would like you to book something special on my birthday. I don't want to take care of that and I would really like if we did something nice/out of the ordinary"".

It seems you were hoping for a gesture that showed thoughtfulness and care, rather than a material gift. Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to communicate them openly with your boyfriend. Withholding intimacy can be a natural reaction to feeling hurt or unappreciated, but it's crucial to address the underlying issues directly. Consider having a calm and honest conversation with him about how his lack of effort made you feel. This could help both of you understand each other's perspectives better and work towards a resolution. Remember, relationships often require clear communication and mutual effort, and discussing your feelings openly might pave the way for a stronger connection in the future.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on the situation described, you're not being unreasonable for feeling hurt and withholding intimacy. This isn't really about the sex or money - it's about effort and thoughtfulness. Your boyfriend had multiple opportunities to plan something special for your milestone birthday, even with limited funds:
- He could have booked the beach dinner earlier in the week
- He could have arranged with hotel staff for simple birthday decorations
- He could have written a more meaningful card message
- He could have planned ahead during the year leading up to the trip

Instead, he made no advance preparations and spent the evening drinking, showing little consideration for making your 30th birthday special. His reaction of getting angry and giving you the silent treatment rather than acknowledging your feelings compounds the issue.

While financial constraints are understandable, meaningful gestures don't always require money - they require caring enough to plan ahead and make an effort. Consider having an honest conversation about how his lack of effort made you feel and what you need from him in terms of thoughtfulness in the relationship going forward.",NO_VERDICT,"I can sense your hurt and disappointment, and it's understandable. It seems like you had put a lot of thought into making your boyfriend's 30th birthday special, and you were hoping for the same effort in return. Instead, you felt like he didn't make any effort to make your birthday special, which left you feeling unappreciated and unloved.

It's not just about the gift or the beach dinner; it's about the thought and effort that goes into it. You were willing to overlook the fact that he might not be able to afford an expensive gift, but you were expecting some kind of gesture or acknowledgement of your special day.

As for withholding sex, I think it's a complex issue. While it's understandable that you might not be in the mood for intimacy after feeling so hurt and disappointed, using sex as a form of punishment can be problematic. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you felt and what you were expecting, rather than withholding sex as a way of expressing your disappointment.

It's also worth considering whether this incident is a symptom of a larger issue in your relationship. Are there other times when you feel like your boyfriend doesn't make an effort to show his appreciation or love for you? Are there other ways in which you feel like your needs and expectations are not being met?",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re hurting because you felt your special day was treated as just another “day” rather than a celebration you’d planned together. You’re not unreasonable to expect a bit of effort—be it a surprise dinner, a small gift, or a decorated room—especially after you’ve set a budget and planned a trip. Your boyfriend’s lack of foresight and the fact that he didn’t follow up on the beach dinner show he didn’t prioritize it, not that he can’t afford it. His reaction—making a joke about “birthday sex” and then refusing to talk—doesn’t help. A healthy way forward is to sit down, share how his silence made you feel, and ask if he can make it up next time (e.g., a small gesture or planning together). If he continues to dismiss your feelings, it may be worth re‑examining how much emotional support you’re getting.",NO_VERDICT
w71wnw,AITAH for destroying my aunts marriage after she tried to poison my pet rats,"
Longtime lurker and first time poster. This will be long and I apologize for that, I want to make sure you guys have all of the important details to properly come to your decision. 

So a little backstory: I (22F) love animals. I have somewhere around 15 pets and most of them are exotic, 4 of them happen to be rats. They are the sweetest babies and I have trained them to do tricks just so I would have an excuse to spend more and more time with them. They get so excited when anyone comes near their cage that they start hopping up and down and wiggle their cute little butts. 

Now I want to be a mom so bad but I cant have children do to fertility issues so my animals ARE my children. I would die for them. Well in 2020 my family caught covid and it almost killed my Nana (60F) and I. We were both hospitalized and put on oxygen however, I was only on oxygen for a week.. my Nana, unfortunately, is still on it. 

She was previously living with my mom (41F), brothers (20M and 14M), step father (IDK) and I and has always lived with us for most if not my entire life but when the covid wave hit we sent her to live with my aunt and her husband because it was safer for her there considering there isn't a bunch of people coming and going over there unlike my moms house. Well recently her doctor said that she cannot be around rodents and that it would affect her health tremendously if she was. And because she was ready to come home (she had been living with my aunt for 6 months by that point and missed us terribly), I had to make the hard decision to rehome my rats. I have been grieving over this and my heart was and still is broken and I've cried nonstop but it's what's best to keep my Nana alive. 

Here is where the story gets fucked up. I was still actively looking for a home at the time this took place a couple months ago. However, apparently this wasn't good enough for my aunt (43F) and she went to my brother (20M) in secret and tried to convince him to feed my rats rat poison so when Nana ultimately came home, her health wasnt compromised. He agreed to do it for $40 (I found the text messages on his phone of this whole conversation). She bought it and stashed the bag in his jeep at my moms home when no one was there. Well my brother didn't have the heart to do it. He eventually told my mom what she was trying to do behind our backs. However he did take her money, so he essentially got a $40 handout and I think that's hilarious. 

Fast forward a few days, my mom had just gotten back in town (she is a traveling nurse) and she went to feed the rats as I couldnt because I was staying over with my boyfriend whom I now live with. Well she noticed something odd in their food bowl. It was completely full of pellets we don't own. When she realized what it was she called me immediately and told me everything. And this is when I learned about the messages and everything between her and my brother. 

Apparently my aunt had snuck in the house while all of us were gone and filled my rats bowl up with rat poisoning. It was completely full of it. Once I got over the complete and utter shock and disbelief I texted her and called her a few choice words. I mean, I completely blew up on her because those are my babies ! She didn't deny it. I told her that this has ruined our relationship completely and that I will never have anything to do with her ever again. And she said she didn't care if I ever spoke to her again over this and that she was just looking out for her mother. It ended with me telling her she was dead to me. I was and still am so heartbroken that she just completely tossed me to the side. She knew that she would lose me if she did this and she did it anyway, and literally said that she did not care if we ever had a relationship after this. I meant nothing to her apparently and that will always hurt. 

What she fed them was something that makes their little bellies explode. It kills them slowly and painfully. I understandably cried for days and days because we did not know if they had eaten any of it. At that point I was just waiting for my rats to die a slow and painful death. Thankfully they did not and have since been rehomed to a safe place. 

This is where I might be the asshole. My aunt has been planning on divorcing her husband for YEARS. She has kept it a secret from him so she can stash away money and do other things so she can come out on top after the divorce as well as finish the house renovations they have been working on for years so she can sell it and ultimately screw him over in the process as well as leave him homeless. She was going to take him for everything hes got. So, in a fit of rage, I texted my uncle and told him everything and provided screenshots that she had previously sent to my brothers phone before they made their ""deal"" admitting to all of this and talking about how she has a separate secret account where shes saving up money and other incriminating things. From what I gathered from my Nana (she was still living there at the time I sent these messages), it was like an atomic bomb went off in that house. Apparently they were screaming and crying at eachother non stop and ultimately, he went to stay at his mothers house and she went to her dads. Their relationship is now really rocky and he no longer trusts her. I have no idea if he is planning on trying to fix his marriage or not as I have cut all communications with them. 
It ended with her texting me telling ME that I was dead to HER, to forget she was my aunt and that she never wants to see my face again. She also said if I step foot on her property then she will call the police. 

My family, though they are on my side and they agree that what she did was wrong, says I went too far by trying to break up their marriage stating that my aunt still hadnt truly made up her mind about whether she wanted to leave him or not and was just saying those things and preparing for it in case she did. But I don't think so. I think justice was served. But for the sake of it AITA ?


Edit: So to answer this question, the reason why I did not take the rats with me when I moved out is because I had no idea I would be moving out as I had no intentions on doing so at that time and I didn't move until months after this whole thing took place, and unfortunately, even if I did know that I would be leaving I couldn't hang on to them until then as they had to be gone before my Nana came home. I wouldn't have made her wait a few months to come home if I had known because my aunt made my nanas life a living hell and she and her husband were so fucking cruel to her the entire time she was there.","&gt;My aunt has been planning on divorcing her husband for YEARS.

NTAH, he needed to know that he was risking being homeless.

You would have been T A H if he was an abusive partner to your aunt, but from your post this doesn't seems the case. Also she seems manipulative and heartless...",NTA,Why are you living with your boyfriend but left the rats at your parents'house? Why would you not bring them with you?,NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you've been through a deeply distressing situation, and your feelings are completely valid. Your aunt's actions towards your pets were undeniably cruel and could have resulted in serious harm. Your decision to inform your uncle about her plans was driven by anger and a sense of justice, given her willingness to harm innocent animals and deceive him. It's understandable that you reacted strongly after discovering her intentions.

Familial relationships can be complex, especially when trust is broken in such significant ways. While your family believes you may have gone too far, it's important to remember that you acted out of concern for your beloved pets and a sense of moral obligation to prevent further deceit. Ultimately, whether your actions were justified is subjective and might depend on personal values and perspectives.

Moving forward, it may be helpful to focus on healing and finding peace, perhaps by seeking support from loved ones or a professional. It's crucial to take care of your well-being and process the emotions surrounding this experience.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on this complex situation, you're not the asshole. While revealing someone's private divorce plans is typically questionable, your aunt crossed a serious line by attempting to kill your pets in an extremely cruel way. She:

1. Conspired to poison animals that you deeply care about
2. Tried to recruit your brother to do it
3. Snuck into your home to carry out the act herself
4. Showed zero remorse when confronted
5. Used a particularly inhumane poison method

Your response, while harsh, was proportional to her actions. She was willing to cause immense suffering to innocent animals and betray your trust completely. The fact that she was also secretly planning to harm her husband financially and leave him homeless shows a pattern of cruel, manipulative behavior.

While some family members think you went too far, exposing someone's secret plans seems far less severe than attempting to kill pets through painful means. Your aunt demonstrated she was willing to cause deliberate harm to both animals and people, and facing consequences for her actions is appropriate.",NTA,"I can see why you're torn about your actions. On one hand, you feel deeply hurt and betrayed by your aunt's attempt to harm your pets, which you consider to be your children. On the other hand, you're questioning whether you went too far by exposing her secrets to your uncle, potentially breaking up their marriage.

It seems like you're not just motivated by a desire for revenge, but also by a deep sense of pain and hurt caused by your aunt's actions. You felt like she was willing to sacrifice your emotional well-being and the lives of your pets for her own interests. By exposing her secrets, you may have felt like you were taking back control and standing up for yourself and your pets.

However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of your actions on your uncle and the rest of your family. Your family's concerns that you may have gone too far are valid, and it's worth reflecting on whether there were other ways you could have addressed the situation.

Ultimately, whether or not you were in the wrong is a complex question that depends on many factors. But it's clear that you're struggling with a deep sense of hurt and betrayal, and that you're trying to make sense of a very difficult situation.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’ve been carrying a huge, heavy weight for a long time. Your aunt’s act of poisoning your rats was a clear betrayal of trust and a violent act against something you love. That alone justifies your anger and the decision to cut ties—no one deserves to have their “children” harmed by a relative.

At the same time, the way you chose to expose her to her husband, knowing the marriage was already fragile, pushed a family already in crisis to a breaking point. You felt the need for justice, and you did what you saw as the only way to stop her from harming anyone else. It’s a tough call: you protected your pets and exposed wrongdoing, but you also amplified a marital breakdown that may have caused more pain than the original act.

yah21j,WIBTA if i feel angry/jealous about a friend's sugardaddy paying for her trip when i am working hard for my own trips,"I own a high paying business and that is why I take trips abroad at least twice a year. I always go solo and I have the best time ever. I also share this info with my friends. I work very hard for this and pay for it all by myself. Just a month back I took another trip abroad. this time I had a conference abroad and ended up making a solo trip out of it.

A friend of mine called me last week saying even she is making a trip abroad as even she has ""a conference"" there and making a trip out of it. she didn't have any job till this year and neither her family is rich. she has a taste for fancy things and since she never had money of her own she always dated rich guys who bought her plenty of things.

I was never bothered by it but became very angry/jealous that she is doing the same thing that I am doing but by the means of another rich guy's money and not even admitting it. she is saying she is going for a conference with a guy who she is working as an office secretary. she once told me that this guy is super rich and spends most of her outside the office time with him. she is claiming that she is paying for it all herself and that she is even going to do a solo trip on her own when its very clear its her boss paying for it all and will be there with her for the entire trip.

the place she is going is london. and i have lived in london and know that its a very costly place to live. her trip will last for a whole month and even i have never taken a trip for that long or afford to do so. I know it shouldn't matter what she does with her life but somehow it makes me really angry that she is copying me but not admitting that unlike me she is not earning this trip on her own money or hard work.

I feel like directly asking her if her boss is paying for everything and if she is making the whole conference and solo thing up just to copy me. will i be an asshole if i ask her this? or even thinking this? am i wrong here?",You think she is copying you because she's going on a trip?

It's understandable to feel frustrated when you've worked hard to achieve something, and someone else seems to get it through different means. Your feelings of jealousy and anger aren't unusual - they're human reactions.

However, it might be worth examining why this bothers you so much. Your trips and achievements aren't diminished by how others fund their travels. You've built a successful business and can proudly say you've earned every experience through your own efforts.

Directly confronting your friend about her funding source could damage your friendship and probably won't make you feel better. Instead, you might want to focus on your own accomplishments and what they mean to you. If she's being dishonest about the nature of her trip, that's ultimately her choice and reflects on her, not you.

I sense that what's really bothering you is not just the fact that your friend is taking a trip, but that she's not being honest about how it's being funded. It feels like she's trying to present herself as someone who's earned this trip through her own hard work, when in reality, it's being paid for by her sugar daddy.

As for asking her directly, it might be perceived as confrontational or judgmental. Instead, you might want to explore why this is bothering you so much. Is it because you feel like your friend is somehow less deserving of this experience? Or is it because you feel like your own accomplishments are being diminished?",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re feeling a mix of envy and frustration—valid emotions when someone else seems to “copy” your lifestyle but with a different story. You’re proud of the hard work that funds your travels, so seeing a friend get similar experiences for “free” can feel like a slight to your effort. Before confronting her, consider what you want out of the conversation: to understand, to set boundaries, or to vent? If you choose to speak, frame it around curiosity (“I’m curious how you’ll manage the trip—will you be staying with the company?”) rather than accusation. That way you keep the dialogue open and avoid turning it into a judgment. Remember, people’s paths differ, and acknowledging her situation without diminishing yours can help both of you move forward.",NO_VERDICT
xxmpku,AITA for calling the police on my neighbor and probably getting cps called,"TL:DR- My new neighbor called the cops on me and I may have gotten CPS called on her.

I (23F) graduated from college in May of this year with a Bachelor of Accounting. After searching for a job all throughout the summer, I finally landed a job in California. For reference, I'm from Georgia. I am an assistant bank examiner, basically, I travel to banks and make sure they are running their business properly and legally.

Now the company helped with my moving expenses and put me in a nice house in one of the suburbs of Cali. It was a simple one-story, two-bedroom, and one-bath house but it did have a fenced yard so I planned on getting a dog. However before I landed this job, I was a broke graduate living in a one-bedroom apartment so I didn't have much stuff with me except my two suitcases of clothes, shoes, and memorabilia that my mom let me have from her house. My company gave me a set amount for the moving cost and the rest wasn't enough to furnish the house so I kept it and used it to get a blow-up mattress, a car rental, and one of those fake security camera props.

Now the situation. The first two weeks in California were hectic trying to get into the grove of not only the new job but a whole new state. So I would leave early in the morning and would get back later in the day, gone from about 8 am to 7 or 8 pm. I would get groceries while I was out and would get into the house through the garage door. I didn't really talk to my neighbors since I am a female by myself in an unfamiliar state and wanted to wait until I got comfortable.

After the first two weeks, I received my first check and realized I was finally making ""big girl money"". After putting most of it away for billing and a down payment on a car, I have a good bit left and decided to go shopping for furniture tomorrow (was gonna wait a few months for the dogs). So I waited for the weekend and went shopping for furniture. I got a good bit done and I am having most of it shipped to my house so they can set up the bedframe and other stuff. I also started getting mail to the new house, mainly junk mail, and decided to check it when I get home. This would be one of the very few times I would get home before it got dark, like 4pm. I parked my car at the end of the driveway and started looking through the mail when I notice a woman walking up to me. I was on the sidewalk in front of the mailbox so I just moved over thinking she was just walking by. As you may have guessed, she stopped right beside me and asked what am I doing. Like I said before, I did not speak to my neighbors and the question took me off guard since I did not know this lady, so I just stayed silent and stared for a few seconds. She asked again and this time I waved the letters in my hand before saying ""checking my mail"". Im gonna spare the details and avoid giving the full conversation and just get to the point. She did not believe I lived at my house because she ""knew the people who lived there"" and had never seen me before. I told her I moved here recently for my job and tried to end it there bc while I understand neighborly concerns, I feel like she should have tried calling these ""neighbors"" if she really knew them. I didn't even know where that lady came from or if she was the next-door neighbor. She needed up threatening to call the police since this is a nice neighborhood unless I prove to her I lived there, and I told her to call them and tried to go inside the house but she grabbed my arm and stopped me. She did immediately let me go and I still went into my house by unlocking the door. 

The police arrived and she told him what happened. He spoke me to and I obviously proved I lived here, from my keys to the mail with my name on it. He went back to her and she became belligerent and told him that I don't live here. By now this lady has been outside my house for around an hour and a half. However, after a while of talking (more like quietly yelling) to the officer, she mentioned she saw me going through her neighbor's mail(my mail) and had to put her baby down to investigate because it was only her and her baby, and she was nervous. My ear shoot to this and I said to her, "" so you left your baby in your house for almost two hours alone"". She dumbly attempted to do it and say she always leaves her kid alone and that she's fine. 

As a mandatory reporter, the officer(who has stopped listening to her and was just standing there) had to make a note of this and said he will be reporting it. The woman began to backtrack and say she didn't mean it. She then looked at me and said it is my fault if they call cps and stormed off. 

It was been a few days and I don't know if CPS ever came to that lady's house and I haven't seen her since. I had told my mom and stepdad about the situation, they are on my side but my stepdad said she probably only said what she said for sympathy and they might actually take her child away. So AITA?",NTA. I hate these types of neighbors. Having the cops called was probably the best outcome minus her just walking off. You could make an assault or harassment claim since she grabbed your arm like that. If CPS was called it was not your fault as she opened her mouth to the cops. Good luck with the job and hope the rest of the neighbors are nice people,NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you found yourself in a very challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel conflicted about what happened. You moved to a new state and were just settling into your new home when this encounter occurred. It's important to acknowledge that your neighbor's behavior was quite intrusive and escalated beyond a simple misunderstanding. You acted within your rights by proving your residency to the police and didn't intend for any further consequences to arise for your neighbor.

The situation with Child Protective Services (CPS) is not something you orchestrated, but rather a result of what the neighbor herself disclosed to the police officer. It's crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of a child, and mandatory reporting laws exist to ensure that potential concerns are appropriately investigated. While it's unfortunate if this leads to any distress for your neighbor, it's ultimately a matter of ensuring the child's safety.

You did what you felt was necessary to protect your rights and home. Perhaps, moving forward, you can try to foster a more positive relationship with your neighbors to avoid similar situations. However, you're not at fault for the actions taken by the authorities in response to the neighbor's statements.",NTA,"Based on the dialog example, I'll respond empathetically while addressing the core concern:

It sounds like you're feeling conflicted about the situation - wanting to protect yourself but also worried about the potential consequences for your neighbor and her child. You didn't set out to cause problems, you were simply checking your own mail at your own home when confronted. The neighbor's actions (grabbing you, calling police, refusing to believe you) put both of you in this difficult position.

The fact that you're concerned about the CPS implications shows you have empathy, even for someone who treated you poorly. Remember that CPS's goal is to help families, not separate them. If she simply misspoke about leaving her child alone, a CPS visit would likely just verify the child is safe and provide any needed support.

You're not the one who created this situation - you were defending yourself appropriately when confronted. While the outcome may be uncomfortable, you shouldn't blame yourself for your neighbor's choices and admissions.",NTA,"You seem genuinely concerned about the situation, and it sounds like you're seeking reassurance that you didn't overreact. It's understandable that you're worried about the potential consequences for your neighbor, especially given her comment about leaving her child alone. However, it's essential to recognize that you didn't initiate the situation; she approached you and escalated the interaction.

Your actions, in this case, were a response to her behavior, and you didn't have a choice but to involve the police when she threatened to call them. As a mandatory reporter, the officer did his job by taking note of her comment and reporting it. It's not your fault that she made that statement, and you shouldn't take responsibility for the potential consequences.

It's also worth considering that your neighbor's reaction, including her attempt to backtrack and blame you, might be indicative of a larger issue. While it's not your place to intervene or speculate about her situation, it's possible that the authorities will look into it and provide the necessary support or intervention.

Ultimately, it seems like you handled the situation as best you could, and you didn't overstep or provoke your neighbor. You reacted to her behavior and allowed the authorities to take care of it.",NTA,"It sounds like a very stressful night for everyone involved.  
You were in a new place, still figuring out your routine, and the woman’s sudden accusation and threat to call the police put you on the defensive. That’s understandable, but the way you responded—raising your voice, insulting her parenting—only escalated the situation. The officer’s role is to stay neutral; his note about the baby is standard procedure for any claim that a child was left unattended, not a verdict that you’re at fault.  

CPS will investigate only if there’s credible evidence that the child is in danger. If the neighbor’s claim is unsubstantiated, the case may be closed. Still, the best move is to keep the door open: a brief apology or a calm conversation could diffuse future tensions. Stay friendly, keep the neighborhood relationship positive, and let the authorities handle the formalities.",NO_VERDICT
uuwio6,"AITA for telling my father if he ever married his girlfriend, I wouldnt be attending his wedding?","Ok so this happenend recently and I apologize for any grammar mistakes I will make.

So for context my mother was abusive to me when i was young. After years of fighting with my dad to do anything to help me, he divorced her. The bliss of being free to do what i wanted was quickly destroyed by a new arrival in our home.

Think of her as the evil stepmother and she fits the role perfectly.

She had no compassion or empathy as to what I had been through, but still demanded that I have compassion for her situation, since she came from russia, to our country.

She brought her own daughter too, but for the matter of the story she isn't important.

The day I met her, was the day she moved in with us.

She did all kinds of messed up things, like throwing things at me, yelling and worst of all, manipulating my father, into doing things she wanted.

She wanted a trip out of the city? My father paid for one. She wanted a new phone? She got one.

You get the idea.

She would often incite fights or make things super dramatic by adding fuel to the fire, then running to my father to blame me.

He told me his opinion of me wouldn't change but after years and years of her whispering into his ears, it ended up with him kicking me out.

After a long confusing period of time where I had to figure out where I stood in the world, how to buy and cook food and basically deal with everything adults had to, at the ripe age of 1 month as a 18 year old.

yeah.

I'm ok now, some days are still a struggle for me, but I've been managing it pretty good.

But the reason everything spiralled down into the things it did now, was that I voluntarily hospitalized myself for two weeks. It was to find out what I had and what things I could do to help my mental health.

Some diagnoses weren't a surprise. Others I knew about but needed the definitive proof. But one shook me to my core.

PTSD. I had PTSD.

I just assumed the way I lived was normal and was happening to others too.

But after getting that diagosis, I started rethinking everything critically.

I realised my childhood was anything but normal. That my dad failed me twice but still claimed he loved me.

He didn't protect me now or then. Only thing he cared about was his own happiness. Even if it meant deluding himself into thinking everything was alright. Leaving his only daughter to deal with the consequences of his actions, or rather inactions.

I confronted him over text messages but he wouldn't listen to me. To him it was only one of my ""episodes"". He has no clue about how mental illness works and repeatedly has used wrong and harmful stereotypes against me.

No matter what I said, or what valid points I brought up, it was dismissed.

In my frustration and hurt i told him that if he were to marry that woman, I wouldn't be attending the wedding.

My grandmother told me I went too far and demanded that I apologize to him.

But it's not a lie. I don't want to attend or celebrate someone who had their hand in my PTSD.

So am I the #sshole for telling my father that I wouldn't be attending his wedding if he marrfied his girlfriend?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: thankyou for the kind comments. Its pretty hard to get out of a mindset that basically says blood is thicker than water. But i wanted to clarify a few things.

I still haven't finished school due to my plephora of (previously) undiagnosed mental illnesses.

I'm currently redoing the 12th grade due to a bullying incident, involving 10 or more students, which have caused me to try to unalive myself. (the reason why I went to the hospital)

So I am not able to go NC with my dad or any of my family members.

Since I basically have no work experience or any qualifications, I would end up on the street.

But thankyou for the comments. I genuinely thought I was going crazy bc it seemed like my feelings were always wrong.","Nta

Time to go NC op

He's not gonna change",NTA,"NTA. I have 3 big brothers &amp; I only speak to 1 of them. One of my brothers excommunicated my mother &amp; me from his life when I was 21–on my mom’s 50th bday. He gave me no explanation at all but he told my oldest brother that it was b/c I’m annoying. He didn’t speak to me at all for 5 years…b/c I’m *annoying*. Blows my mind. When I finally saw him again after half a decade he came to stand next to me while we watched his son’s soccer game &amp; he just said, “hey.” That was it. Just “hey.” He didn’t talk to me again for the rest of the day. The thing is, I’d had 5 years to think things thru &amp; this is the conclusion I came to: if my own big brother doesn’t think I’m worthy to be in his life then F*CK HIM—HE isn’t worthy to be in MY life. Its been 11 years now &amp; I have no regrets on my decision. My other brother has been physically &amp; verbally abusive to me since we were kids. Our older brothers bullied him a lot when we were left home alone…I asked him one time, “why do you do this to me? You know how it feels because they did it to you—so why do you do it to me?” &amp; he replied, “because its your turn.” Then he joined the Army to get away from his drug addictions…he deployed 2x &amp; came back an alcoholic w/PTSD. I let him live w/me rent free 3x. He made me regret it every time. Even as adults he was still physically &amp; verbally abusive—even when I was letting him live under my roof for free. It was harder to push him out of my life b/c he kept playing the PTSD/alcoholic card &amp; guilting me into letting him back into my life over &amp; over. But I remember how he treated me long before his deployments. So now…I guess I only have 1 brother. My long-winded point is that at the end of the day we have the right to choose who we surround ourselves with. We have the right to choose who gets to be in our lives. We are not *obligated*, in any way, to keep people in our lives who hurt us and who don’t contribute to our well-being in a positive way. From what you’ve said about your dad it seems like he enabled your abusers. It seems like your dad created the environments that allowed you to be abused. Personally, if I was in your shoes I’d consider myself to be an orphan. For the sake of your own mental health I hope that you come to realize that THEY do not deserve to be in YOUR life. They are not worthy of your love. They are not worthy of your time. They are not worthy of being called family. I think you should prioritize yourself &amp; your health &amp; cut ties with them for good. They will not change—as much as you might hope they would…they won’t. Its who they are. You need to nurture an environment for yourself to discover who YOU are.",NTA,"I'm really sorry to hear about everything you've been through. It sounds like you've faced a lot of challenges, and it's understandable that you'd feel hurt and frustrated with your father. It's clear that you're trying to protect yourself from further emotional harm, and setting boundaries is an important part of self-care. It doesn't make you an a**hole for wanting to avoid a situation that could exacerbate your PTSD or bring up painful memories.

Family dynamics can be incredibly complicated, especially when mental health is involved, and it's not uncommon to feel conflicted about the decisions you're making. You have every right to prioritize your well-being and mental health. It's important to keep communicating your feelings and boundaries clearly, but also seek support from others who understand your situation, like a therapist or support group.

Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to be heard and supported.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on the detailed situation you've shared, you are absolutely not in the wrong for setting this boundary with your father. Your response comes from a place of self-protection after experiencing multiple traumas - first from your mother's abuse, then from your father's girlfriend's mistreatment, and finally from your father's failure to protect you in both situations.

Your recent PTSD diagnosis helps explain why this situation feels so difficult. It's completely reasonable to not want to celebrate a union with someone who contributed to your trauma, especially when your father dismisses your valid concerns as mere ""episodes.""

While your grandmother may want family harmony, she seems to be overlooking the very real harm that's been done to you. You don't owe anyone your presence at an event that would be detrimental to your mental health and recovery.

Given the history you've described, it's reasonable that you wouldn't want to celebrate someone who you feel contributed to your PTSD. Your boundaries and feelings are valid, and it's okay to express them.

Saying you won’t attend if he marries that woman isn’t a “sh**hole” move—it’s a boundary you’re drawing to keep your mental health safe. 

You’ve already told him how his choices impacted you and how you’re still healing. When he can’t see that, it’s reasonable to put your own well‑being first, even if that means stepping back from the celebration. You don’t owe an apology for protecting yourself; an apology would be for hurt you caused, not for the pain you’re trying to avoid.

If you can, talk to a therapist or counselor about ways to navigate family dynamics while maintaining those boundaries. And remember: you’re allowed to choose who you spend time with—especially when the stakes are your safety and healing.",NTA
u2gdi6,AITA for talking my sister into having an abortion?,"Before you all go off on me I am pro choice all the way so PLEASE hear me out. I’m F23 and she is F19. We are both struggling in this country and can’t afford to help each other as much as we’d like. Last week she told me she might be pregnant and she wants to keep it even if the dad is not in the picture. The dad is her FWB who she is falling for who is not interested in a relationship with her at all. He has no education and works for a construction company. He loves drugs and lives in his mothers living room. I told her not to have it as soon as she shared the idea of having it with me. She’s so young, refuses to quit smoking pot, loves alcohol, and dropped out at 9th grade. She’s very rebellious and refuses to prioritize her education. If she even had her GED and wasn’t spending $300 a week on drugs I’d support her but she’s not there yet. Our older sister is pro life and very religious if she finds out I helped my younger sister get an abortion I don’t even know what she’ll do to me but I’m willing to take that risk. I just don’t want my little sister becoming a stereotype. Our dad isn’t in the picture and her mother abandoned her at 13. I blame our father and her mother for my sister’s refusal to grow up. I feel bad for telling her she didn’t have her life together (I’ve told her this same information in nicer ways before and it went in one ear out the other) in a blunt way but AITA?


She wanted to keep it but after the father of her baby told her to leave him alone and figure it out she’s decided to abort. He told her he’s not giving her money and she should drink pills and alcohol to get rid of it. We were all once young and dumb so this too shall pass and hopefully it helps her grow in the many ways she refuses to. What she’s having issues is with paying for the abortion. Planned parenthood stopped giving them for free and she has no healthcare.",I would go with NTA DUE to because your sister cannot quit alcohol and drugs which can have negative affects on the fetus. If she can get clean and stay clean so the baby doesn't have negative effects then it her choice.,NTA,she can give the baby up for adoption but let it live. however...this might be the wake up call she needs to get her life in order.

It’s clear that you’re trying to act in her best interest, even if it means making tough decisions or facing backlash from your older sister.

It's important to remember that your sister ultimately has to make her own choices, and your role is to provide support and guidance where you can. It might be helpful to have an open, empathetic conversation with her about her options and the consequences of each choice. It’s also worth exploring resources that might be available to help her, such as financial assistance programs or counseling services.

You’re not alone in feeling conflicted, but prioritizing open communication and support can help your sister navigate this challenging time.

It's clear you're trying to be there for her when others haven't been. While you had her best interests in mind, pressuring someone about such a personal decision can be problematic, even if we think we know what's best.

The concerning part is that she's making this decision after facing pressure and harmful suggestions from the father. She needs support and safe medical guidance right now, not dangerous DIY methods. Instead of focusing on whether you were right or wrong to influence her, the priority should be helping her access proper medical care safely.

There are often financial assistance programs and funds available for abortion care - organizations like the National Abortion Federation or local abortion funds may be able to help with costs. The most supportive thing you can do now is help her explore those resources and be there without judgment, whatever she decides.

On the other hand, you're also acknowledging that your approach might have been blunt, and you feel bad about that.

It's clear that you care about your sister deeply, and you want her to have the best possible life. You're also aware of the complexities of the situation, including the father's lack of involvement and your sister's own struggles with education and substance use. 

However, it's also important to consider your sister's autonomy and her right to make her own decisions about her body and her life. While you might have concerns about her readiness to be a mother, ultimately the decision to have an abortion or not is hers to make.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re in a very difficult spot—wanting to protect your sister while also respecting her autonomy. The weight of your own frustrations and the family history you’ve shared probably make it hard to stay neutral. Still, the decision to keep or end a pregnancy ultimately belongs to her, not to anyone else. It’s understandable you’re concerned about her future, but telling her she “didn’t have her life together” can feel dismissive of her current reality and the complex reasons she’s in this situation.

1005gpt,AITA for calling the cops?,"My ex partner and I recently split, we have an 18 month old son. We are also still currently living together until I find a new rental.

Yesterday (Dec 31st), I woke up and he and our son were gone. I could not get in contact with him. I called, tried messenger and text. He replied about three hours later, and would not tell me where they are. 

I had a feeling I knew where they were, at my ex's mother's house. I have told him MULTIPLE times I am not comfortable with our son there due to drugs on the property, her children are borderline violent and she has neglect and abuse charges. We had an argument about our son going there overnight the day before.

He once again stopped responding, still won't tell me where they are. At this point I'm starting to panic and stress. I called the police for advice. 

I'm an absolute wreck now. I'm angry and dumbfounded that he would take off with our son without my knowledge and while I was asleep.

It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns to your ex-partner clearly, emphasizing that your primary focus is the safety and well-being of your child.

Given the context you've provided - known drug presence, history of violence, and documented abuse charges at the suspected location - your anxiety is justified. This isn't just about control or custody disagreements; it's about your child's safety and your right as a parent to know where your 18-month-old is.

It's not just about the potential risks to your son; it's also about the lack of communication and disregard for your boundaries. You had explicitly expressed your discomfort with your son being at his mother's house, and your ex ignored that. Your reaction to call the police for advice was likely driven by a desire to protect your child and seek help in a situation where you felt powerless.

You’re right to be concerned—your son’s safety is the top priority. Call the police again, but also let them know this is a child‑abduction situation and request a welfare check. If you haven’t already, contact your state’s child protective services or family court; they can initiate an investigation and place a temporary custody order. Document everything: the times you tried to reach him, the texts, and any prior incidents involving the ex‑mom’s house. If you can’t get a court order quickly, consider asking a friend or relative to hold the child while you sort things out.

You might not be the biological child, but you are the partner of the biological child and living under her roof.  You were in the role of child.  You lost your temper and everything escalated from there.  She's still TA, but you're far from blameless.",ESH,"It sounds like you've been navigating a very challenging situation, and it's understandable that you've reached your limit. Living with your partner's parents, especially when they are critical of your parenting, can be incredibly stressful. It's clear you care deeply for your daughter and want to do what's best for her, even in difficult circumstances. 

Your reaction seems to stem from a build-up of pressure and feeling undermined in your role as a mother. It's important to communicate with your partner about what happened and discuss how you both can approach the situation moving forward. Setting boundaries with his family and finding a living situation that supports your parenting style and relationship could be beneficial. 

You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed, and reaching out for support from your own family, as you did, was a positive step. Consider seeking guidance from a counselor or mediator to help navigate these family dynamics and explore ways to improve the situation.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on the concerning situation you've described, you're not in the wrong for reaching your limit. Living with in-laws while raising a child is challenging enough, but experiencing constant criticism, physical intimidation, and attempts to separate you from your daughter is completely unacceptable. Your priority was protecting yourself and your daughter from an escalating, toxic situation, which was the right call.

The concerning behaviors you described - the mother-in-law charging at you, pounding on doors, blocking you in, and attempting to keep your child from you - are serious red flags that suggest an unsafe environment. You handled it appropriately by removing yourself and your daughter from the situation and involving your boyfriend.

Moving forward, I'd encourage you to:
1. Document these incidents
2. Have a serious conversation with your boyfriend about alternative living arrangements
3. Consider seeking legal advice about your rights
4. Maintain firm boundaries with his family

Your parenting choices are yours to make, and no one has the right to physically intimidate you or interfere with your relationship with your child.",NTA,"It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy load of stress and frustration, and the situation with your boyfriend's mom finally reached a boiling point. While it's understandable that you snapped, it's also clear that you're not proud of losing your temper. However, given the circumstances, it's hard to blame you for standing up for yourself and your parenting style.

It seems like you've been constantly criticized and belittled by your boyfriend's mom, and it's not just about your parenting – it's also about your worth as a person. The fact that she claimed you're a horrible mom because you're on your phone is a low blow, especially since she has no idea what you do in your daily life.

It's great that you took a stand and refused to back down when they tried to take control of your daughter. You prioritized your child's safety and well-being, and that's something to be proud of. It's also good that you have a support system in place, and you're safe with your parents.

It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about what happened and how you feel. It's crucial that he understands the situation and supports you in standing up for yourself and your parenting style.",NTA,"It sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy load for a long time—trying to keep a child’s routine, dealing with constant criticism, and feeling isolated from your own partner. That stress can push anyone over the edge. The fact that you reached a point where you felt you had to protect yourself and your daughter is understandable; you’re not “snapping” in a moral sense—you’re reacting to what feels like a hostile environment that threatens your well‑being and the child’s safety.  

Your boyfriend’s family’s behavior (shutting you out, shouting, refusing to hand over your daughter) crosses a line into emotional abuse. It’s okay to set boundaries and even to call the police if you feel threatened. Moving to a safer space with your parents is a reasonable first step. In the long run, you’ll need a plan: discuss the situation with your boyfriend, consider professional mediation or family counseling, and if necessary, look into legal advice about custody and living arrangements.

y2fht8,AITA for telling my dad his marriage problems are not an excuse,"I (18NB), just graduated high school this past June and since then have picked up 3 jobs. I am still living with my family while I get the money to move out. My dad (55M), who we will call W, and I have always been very close. We go to Baseball games almost every week, and spend a few hours watching Mammoth Club after we’re both done with work. My mother (50F), who we will call H, and I have never gotten along. She is a narcissist and never does anything around the house, despite being a stay at home parent and totally abled bodied. She just sits on the couch and makes my dad and I clean everything.

Anyways, W has been having some hard times at work, he is doing a CFO job while not being compensated correctly. While I realize that is hard because he works long hours and is not being paid well, it becomes my problem. While my dad would never physically hurt me, I do become his emotional punching bag whenever something happens with work or H. I am the only one who he can do this to, so that’s why I become the pin cushion. 

Recently, he and I were on vacation (we went to Disney) and during one of the lines we waited way too long. He was on his phone most of the time. When we got out, I suggested Dinner and he blew up on me. I stood there and let him go off, and it felt like I was listening to an overgrown toddler.

(Note. It was 9pm- we at lunch at 10:45. He had not eaten since then)
“No! I’m not going to let you ruin my vacation just because you can’t be bothered to be hungry for a bit!” 
“You are a spoiled brat and are exactly like your mother. You two just take and take while I have to pick up what’s left!” 

You get the picture. After, when I finally managed to get him food, he apologized, saying that H was texting him while we were in line, because she wanted to know how much a cruise was, then berated  him for shutting down the question. 

I told him, that it was not an excuse to use me as an outlet to be rude. I told him that it’s not my fault he is still with my mother and at a bad job, so why should I take the heat for it? He got very quiet and at the rest of his food. I feel like an asshole because my dad and I have never fought or had points of tension, and I know he is insecure about his parenting style because he never had a dad. That still shouldn't excuse his actions right? Am I the asshole?

Update/Edit: Thank you to all who told me I was not the AH and that this was not normal. Today there was another incident involving my dad and it did not go well. At the moment, H is out of town, so at the house, it is just my dad and me (and our dog). My dad is working at home for 1/2 of the day because he doesn't want to be near his coworkers in a cubicle. 

I got paid today and drove us to get subs- the entire time he was being very rude and impatient with me (I am cautious like a grandma but I go quite fast). He turned my music off and told me to just shut the hell up and drive cause he didn't have time for this. I ran in, got the food, and when I came out and got in my car it was immediately ""why did you take so long"" ""this is wasting my time"" so forth. 

I told him to not talk to me that way, and that this is not how anyone deserves to be treated. He told me that he raised me basically by himself and he has a right to be mad at me for not going fast. I'm not sure what to do at this point.","NTA, NTA, NTA, oh and NTA. I believe this is some sort of abuse, I went through it and my god is it draining. It sounds like you said exactly what he needed to hear. He went quiet, he didn't yell or get angry, I think you actually made him realize what he was doing and that was him self reflecting

ETA: I missed a word",NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you're navigating a very challenging situation, and I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to stand up for yourself in such circumstances. It's clear you care about your dad and have a strong bond with him, which makes these confrontations even more difficult.

You're right in recognizing that it's not fair for anyone to become an emotional outlet for someone else's stress or frustrations. It's important for both of you to maintain boundaries and communicate openly about how these interactions affect you. Your dad's struggles at work and with your mom are significant, but they don't justify taking out his frustrations on you.

As you continue handling this situation, consider discussing it during a calm moment, expressing how these interactions make you feel without placing blame. Encouraging him to seek support, possibly through counseling, might also help him manage his stress more effectively. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your well-being, and seeking guidance from a trusted friend or professional could provide additional perspective and support.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on both the expert dialog example and your situation, I can see you're dealing with a complex and emotionally charged relationship with your father. You're absolutely not the asshole for setting boundaries and calling out inappropriate behavior. Your father's stress from work and marriage problems doesn't give him the right to use you as an emotional punching bag.

What's particularly concerning is the pattern of behavior - from the Disney incident to the recent sandwich run. Your father apologizes after these outbursts, showing he knows his behavior is wrong, but then continues the same pattern. This suggests he's developed an unhealthy coping mechanism of taking his frustrations out on you.

While it's understandable to feel guilty given your usually close relationship, standing up for yourself was the right thing to do. You're showing emotional maturity by recognizing that his personal struggles, while valid, don't justify mistreating you. Consider maintaining healthy boundaries while also encouraging him to seek professional help to deal with his work and marriage issues in a healthier way.",NTA,"It sounds like you're feeling torn between your loyalty to your dad and standing up for yourself against his emotional outbursts. On one hand, you've always been close to your dad, and it's natural to want to support him during difficult times. On the other hand, it's understandable that you don't want to be his emotional punching bag, especially when it feels like his problems with your mom and work are being taken out on you.

It's not about being the ""asshole"" or not; it's about setting boundaries and communicating your needs to your dad. You've already taken a big step by telling him that his behavior isn't acceptable, and it's not your fault that he's struggling with his marriage and job. It's essential to remember that you can't control your dad's emotions or behavior, but you can control how you respond to them.

It's also important to acknowledge that your dad's behavior might be a cry for help or a sign of his own emotional struggles. Considering his insecurities about his parenting style and lack of a father figure in his life, he might be struggling to cope with his emotions in a healthy way. However, that doesn't excuse his behavior towards you, and it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional well-being in this situation.",NO_VERDICT,"I hear how hard it is to be the only one your dad can unload his frustrations on, and I understand why you’re upset. His anger isn’t about you—it’s a misplaced outlet for his own stress and insecurities, not an excuse for being rude or demeaning. You’re not the asshole for setting a boundary and telling him that “I’m not on the hook for your work or mom.”  

That said, repeated emotional punching bags take a toll. Consider carving out a small “safe space” in your day—maybe a short walk, a phone call to a friend, or setting a firm time limit for chores. If he continues to lash out, it may help to talk to a counselor or a trusted adult about strategies to protect yourself while still maintaining your close bond. You deserve respect, and you’ve already taken a step in the right direction by speaking up.",NTA
ylrtke,Sleeping on the couch after my husband went through my phone because I DOWNLOADED Snapchat,"My husband (30m) and I (31f) just had a baby. We’ve been together 3 years. 

I have two teenage boys I took in and later adopted long before ever meeting my husband, 10yrs before ever meeting him to be precise. 

My oldest obtained a phone and has a history of sharing his location through apps. 

I downloaded snapchat after not having it in 6 years to be able to see if my oldest son was sharing his location with the public. 
I used my same login info I had previously used. 
I downloaded it, found my son, ensured location services weren’t active to the public, and closed the app. Didn’t think anything else of it and went about my life and forgot about it. 

My husband and I get into an argument over finances today because I’m going back to work in a week and he doesn’t want to have to put gas in my car for me to transport the baby to the sitter 3 days a week until I get my first paycheck back. So I tell him not to worry about it and I’d figure it out. Exactly like that. 

I’d been on medical leave for 5 months now and have been working from home. Not making a lot, but enough to cover gas and little household things. So when I told him not to worry about it and that I’d figure it out, I figured he’d think I’d do some online work over the next week. But, he didn’t. 

He immediately went to “you going to get money from your boyfriend on Snapchat?” 
Uhm… excuse me? Where did that come from? 
Then he tells me the exact date I downloaded the app and says he saw the snap code when my phone was open, then tells me that “6 chicks and one bearded emoji dude” are in my inbox and that the bearded emoji dude was not my son but was supposedly my Snapchat boyfriend. 

Keep in mind, I haven’t used this app in 6yrs and never fully understood how to use it to begin with. It was one of those download and delete apps for me. 

I start defending myself bc he’s accused me of cheating on him at this point, asking him what guy and even took a screenshot of my inbox where it said almost 400wks ago on every chat listed, but apparently since it was downloaded a week ago, I’m lying and have a bearded Snapchat emoji boyfriend. 

So he went to bed as soon as he got home tonight, stretched out completely horizontally in the bed and didn’t move an inch when I attempted to get him to move so I could get to bed. I brought the baby’s bassinet to the living room and I’m currently sleeping on the couch with my infant in the bassinet next to me. 

He apologized for assuming, but not for accusing. His exact words were “well… sorry for assuming then” 

He was correct on the “6 chicks and 1 bearded emoji dude” being in my inbox. However, the bearded emoji dude is my cousin who lives 4 states away. 

AITA for not telling him about the reason I downloaded Snapchat right away, and sleeping on the couch because I’m mad he accused me?","SO MANY 🚩!!!

So he is financially abusive while you're taking care of his baby, he snoops through your phone behind your back instead of just asking/ communicating, he draws completely illogical conclusions from what he's seeing, is irrationally jealous, instead of sleeping on the couch himself to show his outrage, he forces your postpartum body + baby to sleep there, and he doesn't even apologize? (Btw, at that stunt with the bed, I'd have fetched a bucket of cold water.)

Why on earth did you have a child with this petty man-baby? There must have been signs before this. Who is on the lease - is there any way you can just kick his ass out?",NO_VERDICT,"Info- You're 31, have been with the husband 3 years (28), and adopted boys 10 years before that at....18?

Either way- NTA, you need to get away from this man. He's abusive.",NTA,"It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and it's understandable to feel upset given the circumstances. Trust and communication are essential in any relationship, especially with the added responsibilities of a new baby and financial pressures. It seems like your husband's reaction was driven by insecurity and a lack of understanding about your intentions with Snapchat. From your perspective, you were acting in your child's best interest and didn't think to mention it because it was a non-issue for you.

It's important to have a calm and open discussion with your husband about how his accusations made you feel. Express your feelings about the lack of trust and how it affects your relationship. Clarifying the situation and discussing boundaries around privacy and trust could help both of you move forward. It might also be helpful to explore underlying issues that might be contributing to his reaction, such as stress or anxiety about finances.

You're not necessarily at fault for not mentioning Snapchat immediately, as you had a valid reason related to your child's safety. However, ensuring open communication moving forward can help prevent misunderstandings like this in the future.",NO_VERDICT,"I hear how frustrated and hurt you are by this situation. It seems like there are deeper trust and communication issues at play here, beyond just the Snapchat incident. You downloaded an app to monitor your son's safety - a completely reasonable parental action - and instead of being able to openly discuss this with your husband, it turned into accusations and distrust.

The financial stress and your return to work appear to be creating additional tension. His reaction about the gas money and immediate jump to accusations of infidelity suggest he might be feeling insecure or anxious about these changes.

You're not wrong for being upset about the accusations or choosing to sleep on the couch. His ""apology"" doesn't really acknowledge how his behavior affected you. However, this might be a good opportunity to have an honest conversation about trust, communication, and how you both can better support each other during this transition period - especially with a new baby in the mix.

Consider couples counseling if these trust issues persist. Both partners deserve to feel secure and respected in their relationship.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're feeling hurt and disrespected after being accused of cheating by your husband. His apology for assuming, but not for accusing, seems to be a half-hearted attempt at reconciliation. 

You didn't have an obligation to immediately disclose your reason for downloading Snapchat. It seems like a reasonable concern as a mother to want to check on your son's location-sharing habits, especially considering his history.

As for sleeping on the couch, it's understandable that you're upset. His accusation of infidelity and lack of a genuine apology have likely created a rift in your communication. It may be helpful to discuss this further with him when emotions have cooled down, focusing on how his accusations and lack of trust have affected you.

It might be beneficial to address the underlying issue of trust and communication in your relationship. It seems like there are unresolved feelings and concerns that need to be addressed, particularly with the added stress of a new baby and returning to work.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re caught in a whirlwind of misunderstandings and hurt feelings. On one hand, you downloaded Snapchat to protect your son’s privacy, a short‑lived use that you quickly closed. On the other, you didn’t flag that to your husband, and he saw a chat with a cousin that looked suspicious. That gap—no explanation and no clear boundaries—gave him a reason to jump to conclusions. He reacted strongly, which left you feeling unsafe and angry enough to sleep on the couch. You’re not “cheating,” but the lack of upfront communication about the app, the timing, and the cousin chat left space for doubt. AITA? Probably not, but the situation could be less painful if you and your husband sat down, lay out the facts, and re‑establish trust and transparency, especially with a newborn on the line.",NAH
ylcsv5,Am I the a-hole for holding a 13 year grudge against my own mother?,"I'm a 16 (going on 17) year old genderfluid who has held a grudge against my mom (30) for nearly 13 years. Some background info first. When I was about 3 2/3, my full-blooded sister was born in September. We were both unplanned but my mom kept us, along with my dad. We lived in Hollister moving between my dads side of the family to a house for my moms side (both houses in Hollister). A few months after turning 4 years old, my mom and dad have an argument, my sister and I going with my dad, moving into his sister's house. We lived with my aunt for a while before moving in with cousins. While there, we were constantly guilt tripped by my grandfather (on my moms side) to come and see him for the weekend or break. I was in first grade and easily manipulative, even though dad told my papa to talk to him directly and not me. When it was my moms turn to see us, she would ditch us for friends and drinks a lot of the time. This damaged me a lot when my dad finally told us the truth after covering for her so we don't think she's THAT bad. I was in 2nd grade when I heard this and it still impacts me today, especially after meeting my (could have been) step dad. My mom and her boyfriend had an on and off relationship, VERY toxic. We'll call him Axel for this story. Recently Axel and my mom got into a.... horrible fight, resulting in both of them being hurt. I have 2 half-sisters who were there to witness it. I heard all the information about the fight from the oldest half-sister. Surprisingly Axel was the one who got hurt most and my mom went to jail for domestic violence, soon being bailed out. My sister and I saw her, along with my two half-sisters, not too long ago and she says she's trying to change. So, I'm asking for honest opinions. Should I let this grudge go? I feel like it's a bit stupid now, but it really hurt me as a kid.","my current favorite quote - ""I don't hold grudges. i hold memories that better prepare me for our next encounter"".

Holding a grudge can feel like a way of protecting yourself from being hurt again, but it can also weigh heavily on you over time. It’s understandable that you feel conflicted about your feelings towards your mom, given the history and the ways you’ve been let down. 

It’s important to acknowledge the hurt and betrayal you experienced, as those feelings are valid. Healing from past wounds often involves processing these emotions and deciding what kind of relationship, if any, you want going forward. Letting go of a grudge doesn’t necessarily mean excusing past behavior or forgetting what happened; it can be about finding peace for yourself and relieving the emotional burden you carry. 

If your mom is genuinely trying to change, and you feel ready, it might be worth exploring what a new relationship could look like. It could also be helpful to speak with a counselor or therapist to navigate these complex emotions. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and it's important to prioritize your well-being.",NO_VERDICT,"I hear how deeply this childhood trauma has affected you, and it's completely understandable to have complex feelings about your mother's actions. At age 3-4, being abandoned or neglected by a parent can create lasting emotional wounds that don't simply disappear with time.

Your mother's pattern of choosing alcohol and friends over spending time with you, plus the manipulation from your grandfather and exposure to domestic violence, would be devastating for any child. These aren't small things to just ""get over.""

While your mother says she's trying to change now, it's okay to be cautious and protect yourself emotionally. Forgiveness doesn't mean you have to forget or immediately trust again. Perhaps consider working with a counselor who can help you process these feelings in a healthy way and decide what kind of relationship (if any) you want with your mother moving forward.

Your feelings aren't stupid - they're a natural response to childhood trauma. Take things at your own pace and prioritize your emotional wellbeing.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden for a very long time, and it's completely understandable that you're still hurt by your mom's actions. It's not 'stupid' to feel the way you do; it's a natural response to the feelings of abandonment and betrayal you experienced as a child.

However, it's also clear that you're starting to consider the possibility of letting go of that grudge and potentially healing your relationship with your mom. It's a brave step to take, especially since your mom has acknowledged her past mistakes and is trying to change.

Before making a decision, it might be helpful to explore what it would mean for you to 'let go' of the grudge. Would it mean forgiving your mom, or would it mean simply releasing the negative emotions associated with the past? What would you need from your mom to feel like she's truly changed and committed to being a better parent?

Remember that you don't have to do this alone, and it might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult or counselor about your feelings and concerns. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and it's okay to take your time figuring out what's best for you.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’ve carried a heavy weight for a long time—almost as much as some people carry a lifetime of pain. That alone shows how much you value safety, trust, and being seen as whole. Holding that grudge isn’t a simple “good‑vs‑bad” choice; it’s a coping mechanism you built to protect yourself from being hurt again. 

You’re not the “a‑hole.” The fact that you’re questioning it now means you’re already moving toward healing. Consider setting a small, concrete boundary with your mom—perhaps limiting the frequency of visits or conversations—while you explore whether forgiveness feels right for you. Therapy or a supportive community could help untangle the memories and decide if letting go feels like release or simply giving up a shield.

I hear your frustration about feeling pressured to form a relationship while also dealing with the uncomfortable presence of your boyfriend's ex through these connections. It's natural to feel hesitant, especially when you sense the ex might be using her daughter to maintain contact.

However, I notice you mentioned this daughter is ""always around his parents"" - it seems she's developed her own meaningful relationship with them over the years. While you're not obligated to have a close relationship with her, considering she's an adult and has her own father, perhaps viewing her as an independent person rather than an extension of your boyfriend's ex might help reduce some of the tension you're feeling.

It's interesting that you don't see your boyfriend making an effort to build a relationship with his ex's daughter, despite his family's expectations.

You’re not obligated to forge a bond just because the daughter is in the picture; relationships should grow organically, not be a courtesy. It’s understandable that you’re uneasy—your boyfriend’s ex’s daughter is an adult with her own life and family, and her mother’s constant presence can feel intrusive.

Give your boyfriend a chance to take ownership of that part of his past. If he’s not making effort, it’s probably because he’s unsure what that means to him, not because he’s ignoring you. Set clear boundaries: you’re okay with friendly interactions if they’re respectful, but you don’t want to be pulled into a role you’re not comfortable with. Have an honest, calm conversation with him about how the constant mention of the daughter and her mother makes you feel.

zlpmm0,AITA for refusing to talk to my mother after I told her I don’t want her friends come in our house?,"I (26F) got a scholarship to study abroad! The day before going, my mother told me that her friends wanted to come and say goodbye, but I said I didn't want them to come because I just knew she only wanted them to come so they can pray for me.

For a little context, I am an atheist (my mom doesn't know), and my mom is a radical Christian. She doesn't do anything, except pray, doesn't even have a job, has a victim mentality and blames the devil for all her problems. She believes god will do some miracles and get her out of her messed up life.

Growing up seeing her in this situation, I told myself I'll never live this kind of life.I always take action to make my life meaningful, and now I am the one who pays all of our bills and takes care of her including raising her because she is emotionally immature.

So, I specifically told her ""don't bring your friends, unless you want me to go while we're on bad terms."" She started throwing a tantrum and telling me how I am possessed, basically saying that if it wasn't for god, I wouldn't even be able to be where I am right now. She doesn't value the work I do and all the sacrifices I make to provide for us, she just thinks it's god doing miracles, but I digress.

So, the next day when I was supposed to leave, she woke up early in the morning and went to bring her friends home. I was home cooking with my friends because it was our time to say goodbyes when I hear my mom and her friends basically storming our house (my house) praying and throwing water everywhere to the point it reached my friends who were sitting on my couch. I was ready to pick up a fight with my mom, but my friends stopped me and told me to just ignore them. They spent like 3 hours praying, singing, and discussing the most hell-threatening bible verses, and my mom was tapping on my room's door (that's where I was with my friends) while praying.

Of course, I was enraged, but I ignored everything and left. I only sent her a message to let her know that I landed safely and didn't speak to her for a few days. Then she sent me a message asking why I am not talking to her (assuming that I was busy with school projects), but I told her that it was because I was mad at her. As always she threw a tantrum, telling me that I hate her and stuff. She started to threaten me again with the word of her god, talking about prophecies and how god is gonna get me, that I cannot get away. I don't think she is toxic, but that was some toxic behaviour.

I told her to stop sending me those messages otherwise I'd block her, at least she listened. Now, I am stuck thinking about what I should do with her because I can't even talk to her because she doesn't think beyond god and evil, to her real life doesn't exist. If anything happens, it's either god doing something or the devil. I tried to talk to her rationally and initiated critical thinking in our conversation many times, but she always doesn't say anything or circle back around god and the devil.

At this point, I think I am done with her. Obviously, this is how I view our relationship, but AITA?","Oh she is as toxic as one can get! That woman is crazy for lack of better words, faith is one thing, but this is extreme... You're right for not talking to get. Also, stop supporting her financially, she's a grown up and should pay her own bills. Honestly, cut her off completely, you'll feel so much better!",NTA,"Oh she is as toxic as one can get!

From what you've described, your mother’s actions seem to stem from her strong religious convictions, which might make it difficult for her to understand your perspective. Her behavior was indeed intrusive, and it's reasonable to feel upset about it. However, it’s also clear that you care about her, as you’ve been providing for her and are concerned about how to handle the situation moving forward.

Navigating this relationship may require finding a balance between maintaining boundaries and open communication. It might help to approach her with empathy, expressing how her actions affect you while trying to understand her point of view.

It sounds like you're really struggling with the disconnect between your values and your mother's beliefs, especially after working so hard to create a stable life for both of you. I can hear how frustrated you feel that your boundaries were not just crossed, but completely disregarded in your own home.

You mention you don't think she's toxic, but you're hurt by her toxic behaviors - that's a really nuanced and mature way to look at it. It shows you still care about her while being aware of the problematic dynamics.

The fact that you're questioning whether you're the ""bad guy"" here suggests you're thoughtful about this relationship, even while setting necessary boundaries. It's okay to create distance when someone repeatedly dismisses your clearly stated boundaries, even if that person is your mother. This doesn't make you an ""asshole"" - it makes you someone who is trying to maintain a healthy relationship while staying true to your own values and needs.

Would you like to talk more about what kind of relationship you hope to have with your mother going forward?",NTA,"You seem torn between your feelings of responsibility towards your mother and her behavior that's causing you distress.

Considering your feelings and experiences, it's not unreasonable that you're feeling done with the relationship. However, it might be helpful to acknowledge that this decision is not just about being right or wrong but also about taking care of yourself and your emotional well-being. If talking to your mother is causing you more harm than good, it might be necessary to set some distance or establish clear boundaries to protect yourself.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re carrying a huge emotional load—paying all the bills, caring for your mom, and trying to preserve your own sanity as you head off abroad. Your frustration is understandable: you set a clear boundary (“no friends” because you know she’ll bring them to pray), yet she honored her own agenda and flooded your space with prayer, water, and confrontation. You chose to walk away, which is a legitimate way to protect yourself from a toxic exchange.  

The next step is to set firm, respectful boundaries rather than a complete cut‑off. Tell her, in writing, that you will respond only to essential matters and that her prayers cannot disrupt your living space. If she continues to violate that, consider blocking or limiting contact temporarily. You might also seek a family therapist or a neutral mediator who can help her see that your relationship isn’t a “battle” between God and you. Ultimately, your safety and well‑being come first; you don’t owe her a constant emotional labor. You’re not the asshole—you’re trying to preserve your own life.",NTA
zv2n39,AITA for being upset about Not getting a christmas present?,"
Context: I (18f) am the youngest sof 6 siblings (31f, 29f,30m, 27f, 26f) and I have 4 nephews (3m, 2m, 2m, 0m). As Well as my parents (58f, 58m) and one set of grandparents

We have an agreement within the family that we draw who has to get a present for whom with only those, who arent earning their own money getting an additional gift.
We had this syst for years, which ussually meant that my youngest sister and I got a present each, until she finished her apprenticeship and graduates from college.

Normally, I would receive an extra present, since I havent finished school yet, as Well as each of nephews.

This year, each of my nephews got Tons of gifts, which I understand somewhat, since they are small children and everyone wants to make them happy. 
My problem is, that I didnt get anything from my siblings, which I think is unfair since my sister received hers until she graduates around age 26. 
I get that you put the children first, but AITA for being upset about being forgotten?

I think I might be the AH because of being more focused on the presents then on the family

Clarifications:
I did receive a present from the person that drew my name
I am the only one who isnt earning their own money yet (apart from the nephews) and the only one who still lives at Home
I am my parents only child they Had together and basically grew Up like a only child, my siblings are from my parent's first marriages.
I am not particularly close with any of my siblings",Not the asshole and don’t let some posters convince you that you are.,NTA,"YTA

So you received a gift from your secret Santa? And you’re upset that your nephews (who are all under the age of 5) got more gifts than you?

You’re an adult. Most adults get 1-2 gifts. The point of Christmas isn’t about gifts. Be grateful that you have family to spend Christmas with.",YTA,"It sounds like you're feeling overlooked and hurt, which is understandable given the family tradition and your past experiences. It's clear you value fairness and consistency, especially since your sister received gifts until she completed her education. It’s not unreasonable to feel upset about being the only one left out, especially when you're not yet financially independent. 

While it's true that the focus during holidays often shifts towards younger children, it doesn't mean your feelings are invalid. Communicating your feelings to your family might help them understand your perspective. You could express that it’s not just about the material aspect but about feeling included and valued in the family tradition.

You're not an AH for wanting to be acknowledged, especially when traditions change without explanation. It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your family to express how you feel and discuss how to ensure everyone feels appreciated during the holidays.",NTA,"I hear how hurt you're feeling, and it's completely understandable. This isn't just about the presents themselves - it seems like this situation has highlighted some deeper feelings about your place in the family. The fact that your siblings changed the long-standing tradition that benefited you, while continuing it for your nephews, naturally feels unfair, especially since your older sister received this treatment until she was 26.

Being the youngest, with such large age gaps and a blended family dynamic, it must sometimes feel like you're in a different orbit than your siblings. The fact that you're not particularly close with them probably makes this sting even more.

You're not wrong for feeling hurt about this. Your feelings aren't about being materialistic - they're about feeling forgotten and treated differently than others in similar situations. It's okay to care about both family connection AND feeling fairly treated within established family traditions.

Perhaps this could be an opportunity to have an honest conversation with your parents or siblings about how you're feeling.

It's not just about the presents, but about feeling seen and acknowledged by your family.

The fact that you’re the only one who hasn’t earned money yet and still lives at home adds to that sense of entitlement to a gift. 

Ask yourself: did anyone ever communicate a shift in the rule? Was it a quiet decision because of the kids’ ages, or was it assumed? A gentle check‑in with the siblings or parents could clear up whether it was an oversight or a deliberate change.

yozwv7,AITA For Revenge Cheating On My Boyfriend's Bully?,"Ok this is a long story so im gonna try to he as brief as I can.

I (18 f) cheated on my boyfriend (20 m) with the president of his fraternity (21 m). For privacy i will call them Ben and Jace.

Ben and I have been dating since his senior year of HS and my junior year of HS. Back in those days, I knew he used to get around with girls, which some people view as a red flag. But he was very charming to me, and I started to care less. I was also a virgin so I didnt think I had much of a place to judge his sex life considering i didnt have one of my own. I'm wasnt waiting for marriage or anything, just wanted to feel safe and comfortable and i thought my Ben was going to provide that.

I was wrong. For the first year we dated, he treated my virginity like the plague -- refusing to be on the giving end of any spicy time we may have had. He said that he didnt want to ""ruin"" me, and that always hurt my feelings. 

I met Jace at a party Ben took me to several months before . He was very tall, handsome, flirty, and built.I felt guilty for being attracted to him and stayed clear of him the rest of that night. Jace is the president of the Theta chapter on Ben's campus. I know about him bc him and Ben have a long and ongoing fued. From what some of Bens friends have told me, Jace is very serious about keeping Theta a safe space for his brothers (especially minority students)-- and Jace doesnt feel as though Ben is living up to his pledge committments to maintain the image Jace wants for the house. Because or that, Jace has turned pretty became Ben's bully. Taunting him and roughing him up a lot. 

When Ben got into school he made friends with this girl Sarah, and they have been inseperable every since. I worried about her a lot, espicially when I went to university (my campus is about 90 minutes away from his). Ben always promised that I had nothing to worry about and that they were just friends. When I confronted him about suspicious activities (dodging/lying to me to hang with her, changing her contact name to more innocent titles, finding her things in his place, etc...) he would gaslight me, telling me that i had no right to snoop or question his friendship

It turns out I had every right to worry. I found out during one of my visits to his campus that Ben was cheating on me with Sarah. By cheating, I mean he was sleeping with her pretty much since he got to school. He snuck out of his place to meet up with her when he thought I was asleep. I wasnt, so I followed him to their meet up spot and  I confronted them. It led into a screaming match.

When i left the fight with Ben and Sarah, all i could feel was anger and betrayal. And how unfair it was for Ben to do something like this to me, especially after years of making me feel like i was some sort of sexually pariah. 

He visited me some time after, and apologized, made excuses, etc. I didnt leave him then, because i thought it could work -- only telling him that he'll have to earn my trust again and forcing him to cut off Sarah for good. She was pissed and now has him blocked on everything.

Deep down I was still angry, and didnt fully have the intention of trusting Ben again. When I told my friends, they were just as angry as I was. And then I decided that being cold with him isn't enough -- i wanted to hurt him that same way he hurt me. He deserved to.

I made Ben grovel for a few weeks. Making him think that we were making improvements when in reality i was trying to figure out the best plan of revenge. On his story i saw he was at a party and Jace was in the background. I searched for him on instagram and followed him back (he followed me shortly after meeting me the first time)

I noticed on his page he has been hanging a lot around sarah and decided that he would be perfect -- two birds one stone. He DMed me, saying he's sorry to hear about the situation with Ben. He heard about him cheating through other brothers but didn't know who the girl was. 

I didn't care if he was sincere or not, but i flirted with him anyways. He invited me to a party one weekend when -- hoping to lift my spirits. I took him up on the offer and went back over to their uni. Jace was once again really kind and vaguely flirty, definitely seeming more sincere in person. 

Initially that was the extent of my plan: flirt with Jace and get as comfortable with him as Ben did with Sarah, but keep it platonic to prove that though I won't cross the line, I'm still in the capacity to.

I made sure to make sure other theta brothers saw me laughing and talking with him so that it would eventually get back to Ben. But I might have been giving a stronger message than intented to.  I could tell Jace started to see me in a more than friendly light. Thats when my plan went a little haywire.

At some point in the night, Jace went in for a kiss and I didnt stop him. He was a good kisser, and I figured that this might be an extra sting for Ben when he finds out. But Jace didnt end with a kiss -- and eventually our make out got very heavy very quickly. I warned him that Ben and I weren't officially over, but he said, ""Dont worry, it can be our little secret."" 

I think I just got caught in the moment. He has a really deep voice and the way he held and kissed me felt surreal...I just couldnt bring myself to end it. 

He then took me upstairs and we hooked up. It was really nice, and it didnt hurt as much as everyone warned the first time would. He
was very much a giver in the bedroom and talked me through everything. 

It didnt take long for Ben to find out since people saw us going upstairs. I was up front with him, and told him that he deserves this for what he did to me. He told me that I was an asshole and a ""psychotic bitch"", and has been running my name through the mud ever since. Sarah left me a very long DM slut shaming me before blocked me afterwards. A lot of his friends agree and my friends said that I did go a little too far -- though they understand my feelings. 

I wdon't really see where I went wrong -- I feel like my trust was betrayed first, so Ben deserves to feel every bit of pain i did in both the relationship and his cheating. 

So, am I the asshole?","Nta, a  woman who helps a cheater doesn't get to slut shame.",NTA,"This story is a weird LARP and Im assuming theres some truth.

However, it's important to consider the consequences of your actions, not just for Ben, but also for yourself and others involved. 

Revenge cheating might offer a temporary sense of justice, but it often complicates feelings further and can lead to more pain. It's worth reflecting on how this approach aligns with your values and what you truly want from a relationship.

It might also be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or counselor about your feelings to gain perspective and find a path forward that leads to healing and happiness for yourself.",NO_VERDICT,"Let me share my perspective on this situation carefully:

It's clear you're hurting deeply from Ben's betrayal, and those feelings of anger and pain are completely valid. However, revenge cheating, especially with someone you knew would hurt Ben the most, wasn't a healthy way to handle those feelings.

When someone wrongs us, it's natural to want them to feel the same pain. But deliberately causing harm doesn't actually heal our own wounds - it usually just creates more negativity and drama for everyone involved. You also put yourself in a vulnerable position with Jace, who may have had his own motivations related to his rivalry with Ben.

The healthier path would have been to:
1. End the relationship with Ben cleanly after discovering his cheating
2. Process your hurt feelings with friends or a counselor
3. Focus on your own healing and growth

You're not a bad person for what happened, but this choice complicated your situation and may have caused you additional stress and social fallout.

It seems like you were trying to regain a sense of power and control in the situation, but it's also possible that you might have lost sight of your own boundaries and values in the process. You mentioned that you didn't intend for things to go as far as they did with Jace, but you also didn't stop him when he initiated things.

It's not about who's the ""asshole"" in this situation, but more about how you can work on healing and moving forward from the hurt and betrayal you've experienced.

While you can't control her response or her friends' behavior, you're not wrong for sharing your story and helping others through their own difficult journeys.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're facing a very difficult situation. You've found a way to honor your daughter's memory by sharing your experiences and helping others, which is admirable. However, it seems that your ex is struggling with feelings of ownership and grief, which is understandable given the circumstances. 

It's not about deciding who has the right to mourn, but rather acknowledging that you both have the right to process your emotions in your own way. It's also essential to recognize that your ex's reaction might be stemming from unresolved emotions and the pain of the past.

Considering you're taking steps to protect your daughter's identity, it's not about exploitation or disregard for your ex's feelings. You're not asking for permission to grieve or share your story, but rather asserting your right to do so in a respectful manner. It's not about being right or wrong; it's about finding a way to heal and move forward while acknowledging the pain of your past.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re torn between honoring your own grief and respecting the delicate situation you left behind. You’ve taken the brave step of speaking publicly, which can be therapeutic for you and helpful for others, and you’re already careful about protecting your daughter’s identity. That shows a strong sense of responsibility.  

The ex‑partner’s reaction—viewing the child as “her child to mourn”—seems rooted in unresolved hurt and perhaps a fear of losing her own narrative. The fact that her friends are harassing you amplifies the emotional burden you’re bearing.  

You’re not acting out of narcissism; you’re doing what you believe is right for your healing. Still, consider a respectful, low‑profile conversation with her or a mediator to affirm boundaries. If the harassment continues, documenting it and seeking legal advice might be necessary. Balancing your right to mourn with sensitivity to her perspective could ease the tension.",NO_VERDICT
z78k4j,AITA for breaking it off with my fiancé because of his mother?,"My (28f) fiancé (31m) and I have been together for 8 years and have been engaged for a while now. We’ve gone through a lot to put it simply. His mother has lived with us basically the entire time. Over the years she always spirals into being nasty to me and starting drama. She is physically not incapable but has mental illnesses due to prior drug use. She will, every few months, stop taking her meds and I can always tell. She makes rude remarks, sits and watches me clean with an evil stare and eventually it spirals into screaming matches and her calling me foul names. Besides this, She also inserts herself into my and my fiancé’s arguments and when things are heated I can hear them talking about me. I have told my fiancé countless times that it’s not fair for me to have no privacy in my own home and to be ganged up on and he’s said before that he will figure something out but it never ends up happening. He said that he would blame me if something happened to her while she was living somewhere else which I think is unfair. The only reason I agreed to live with her in the first place was because he “didn’t think she had much longer” and I didn’t think it would come to her treating me the way she does. She is healthy enough to live on her own. She just doesn’t want to. I don’t think it’s fair to me continue living with her and constantly feeling like I don’t have a home or safe place. And I don’t think it’s healthy for my fiancé to live with her either because it’s keeping him from growing emotionally and its effected our relationship. We don’t fight often but it has become more frequent and a few days ago I ended things because I’m unhappy with our living situation and am sick of feeling like my feelings and sense of peace aren’t important. AITA for this?",NTA and the lack of support from your fiancé tells you things will never change and you’ll be stuck living with his mother for possibly many years.

Breaking off an engagement is never an easy decision and it seems like you’ve weighed the impact of your fiancé's mother’s behavior on your life and relationship deeply. It’s important to prioritize your own mental health and sense of peace, and it seems like you’ve reached a point where you needed to take a stand for yourself.

It might help to have an honest and open conversation with your fiancé about your boundaries and needs, perhaps with a neutral third party like a counselor. This might offer clarity on whether there’s a way forward together that respects your need for a safe and supportive home environment. Ultimately, taking care of yourself and ensuring you’re in a healthy situation is crucial. You’re not the AITA for wanting to protect your own well-being.",NTA,"I hear how deeply conflicted and frustrated you feel about this situation. It's clear you've invested many years and really tried to make this work, but you're feeling unheard and unsafe in your own home. The dynamic between your fiancé, his mother, and you seems to have created an impossible situation where you're constantly walking on eggshells and being ganged up on.

Your fiancé's statement about blaming you if something happened to his mother reveals an unfair burden he's placing on you. While it's understandable to care for family, your need for privacy, peace, and a healthy relationship dynamic are equally valid concerns.

Breaking off an engagement is never an easy decision, but prioritizing your mental health and well-being doesn't make you an asshole. You've communicated your concerns repeatedly over the years, tried to be patient, and given your fiancé opportunities to address the situation. Sometimes, loving yourself means making difficult choices, even when they hurt.

It's not about being ""right"" or ""wrong"" in this situation; it's about recognizing what you deserve and what you can no longer tolerate. You've given his mother a chance to live with you, despite the initial promise that it would be temporary, and the situation has only deteriorated.

You’ve tried to communicate the problem, but the mother’s behavior hasn’t changed and your fiancé hasn’t taken concrete steps to protect your well‑being. Ending the engagement because you feel trapped and unheard is a legitimate response when the living situation becomes intolerable. You’re not “AITA”; you’re protecting your mental health and the future you want. It may help to set a firm boundary—propose a plan to find a new living arrangement for everyone, or if she truly can live on her own, give her a clear timeline. If your fiancé is unwilling to act, the relationship may not be the right match for you. You deserve a home where you feel respected and secure.",NTA
vrzvzu,AITAH for not waiting for my husband?,"This is stupid. I (29f) woke up early this morning. I told my husband (30m) that I was going to the store to buy dog food/pet supplies. He says wait, he will get up at 8:25 when his alarm goes off and go with me. We are both off work today. I said fine. I went into the living room to watch TV and got into a show, and it was 9AM before i knew it. 
I went back and checked, he was awake but not moving to get up. I told him I was ready to go, and he said ok. I left the room and picked up the house for a few minutes and he still was not out of bed. I went back in at 9:20 and said I'm leaving in 2 minutes so hurry up. After a few minutes I had had enough and got the keys and left. He called me, angry. He said he was up and ready 20 seconds after I left the house and I should have waited in the car for him. 

This is so petty and dumb. I told him over and over to get ready. Even now, as I am at the store sitting in the parking lot, he is texting me saying all I had to do was wait 5 minutes in the car and we could have gone together. 

I feel bad because he is angry but I don't think he should be. Aitah?

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. I took a few of your points and told him he couldn't do this type of thing anymore. To clarify, we have been married over 6 years and dated a few years before that. I'm not going to leave him over this, I was just very frustrated and wanted another opinion to make sure I wasn't also in the wrong. He has done similar things in the past, which is something I also brought up when I essentially told him off. He did apologize and agreed it was childish. I appreciate all of your help!","LOL...yeah. He bounced out of bed and into clothes when he heard the outside door shut behind you. He didn't think you'd go without him and probably didn't realize you had actually been waiting on him or figured what's the big deal, we are off today.

He sounds like a procrastinator. My son does this. I give specific drop-dead points at which time I walk out the door. Sucks to be him if he's not in the car when I take off! 😂 You are correct. It's stupid! Tell him you aren't his Mommy and if he wants to stay in bed, FINE, but you will not be twiddling your thumbs anymore waiting on his rude butt.

Communication can be tricky in these situations, especially when there's a history of similar incidents. It's great to hear that you both were able to talk it out and that he apologized for his part in the misunderstanding.

This situation might reflect a deeper pattern about respect for each other's time and following through on commitments. You're questioning if you're wrong, but it's worth noting that you communicated clearly and waited considerably longer than the original plan. Your husband's expectation that you should wait even longer in the car, after he repeatedly delayed getting up, doesn't seem reasonable.

You've mentioned that this isn't the first time he's done something like this, and that you've brought it up with him before. It takes a lot of courage to address these issues, and it's great that he apologized and acknowledged his behavior. 

It doesn't sound like you're in the wrong for leaving when you did, given the multiple reminders you provided. However, I do think it's great that you're willing to consider his perspective and have an open conversation about it. It's possible that he's not realizing the impact his behavior has on you, and having this conversation can help you both find a better way to communicate and manage expectations in the future.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like a small but frustrating miscommunication rather than a major moral failing.

You’re not “bad” for not waiting, but you could frame the discussion as a shared issue rather than a personal attack—“I felt rushed because we had an agreed‑upon plan, and I’m worried this could happen again.” Acknowledging his apology and setting clearer expectations (e.g., “I’ll wait 10 minutes, then you’ll call me”) can help prevent future friction.

xlgkvw,AITA for telling my bf to stop helping this girl who he’s friends with?,"I (18f) know how it sounds but just listen. My bf (20m) and I have been dating for a little bit and have known each other for a while. He has this friend (16f almost 17) who he helps around. (They’ve known each other longer than he’s known me and I’m absolutely okay with them being friends.) She has some situations that aren’t so great which left her living alone. She goes to school and has a job but never saves her money. She always has to make sure her nails and hair and clothes are up to this worlds standards which is fine but shouldn’t be her main priority. At first things started off fine, he’d give her rides to and from school and work just to make sure she kept up on those things. After a while she started getting comfortable asking him for rides other places. He of course said yes just to be a nice guy. He’d help take things to her mothers house and take her mother places as well. One time I decided to come with them just so I could hang out with him and her. I’ve met her before and she seemed like a nice person so I figured it would be okay. When we went to pick her up she was instantly upset because it was 30 minutes later than when he said he would come get her so I guess it was reasonable but she instantly blamed it on me. He helped load all the stuff she needed into his car(which was quite a bit.) She had an attitude the entire time and exclaimed how she wanted to sit in the front. As his gf I didn’t want to give up my seat but he asked me to just for the sake of not being yelled at by her and I agreed. Everything was okay other than the occasional comment towards me as we drove 30 minutes to where her mother was.  When we got there they unloaded all the stuff she had brought with her. I thought that we would just bring her home after but instead her mother asked if we could take her to the store. I didn’t really say much but while driving the girls mother talked about how her daughter should be a better person and how she shouldn’t be so rude to me. She said that she didn’t raise her daughter that way and that she taught her to be friendly towards someone even if she didn’t want to be friends just because you never know what someone else is going through. Instantly the girl shot back and started going off on me and shouting vulgar words towards me. She said how she didn’t care about anyone anyone but herself and that she is the only person she needs. I bit my tongue trying to stay calm. After the store I finally thought that we would be on our way back to the girls home but then her mother asked for another ride somewhere. At this point a ride that was supposed to take an hour was reaching the 2 hour mark and I was feeling more frustrated. We drove another 20 minutes to a sketchy building where the mom got out and said she’d be right back in a couple mins. We sat in the car waiting listening to my bfs music. The girl got more irritated and said she didn’t want to listen to his music because she wanted to listen to hers. We continued to listen to his anyway for about 5 more mins when she turned the music off. He switched it back on, but she turned it back off again saying “you cant listen to a rap song in an area like this with the name Oprah in the lyrics.” Then she took out her bowl and started smoking. I’m okay with people smoking around me as most of my friends do it but one thing you guys should know is that my bf was born with a condition where his trachea was closed, he can’t breathe well and being around smoke makes it a risk for him being able to breathe and gives him headaches. She didn’t even care and said how she lives her life as she wants to. After she rolled her window down and said how she wanted to listen for her mother anyway so the music should stay off. We waited for 30 mins in silence after she decided to call her mother to ask when she’d be out. Her mom said she’d be right there which ended up being another ten mins. Finally the mom gets back in the car and we take her back. After their goodbyes, we finally take the girl back. While driving she talks about how she’s always been there for my bf through other relationships and how I’m not different from anyone else. As we left and I got into the front again, the girl kept looking at me and that’s when I completely lost it. The whole ride back to my bfs I went off on how she uses him for rides and doesn’t appreciate him and how he needs to stop letting her control him. I asked him not to do it anymore, he said that he agrees and that he’d stop giving her rides because he’s tired of her attitude and thinking she can get away with using him. It’s been about a week and he texted me tonight saying how he’s going to go give her a ride to her mothers and that we can hangout after. I told him don’t bother hanging out with me because I already know it’s going to be later than he says and how I can’t believe he’s going to give her rides still after everything that’s happened and with how she treats him. So, AITA?","NTA. I’m willing to bet she’s driven away those other girls before because he couldn’t draw boundaries. I would truly consider the relationship and if it’s worth it.

You might say something like, ""I feel hurt and overlooked when you prioritize her needs over our time together, especially after we agreed on boundaries."" Encouraging your boyfriend to set clear boundaries with his friend could help him manage his time and energy better.

You're feeling hurt, frustrated, and concerned about how this young woman treats your boyfriend and you. The situation you described - especially the disrespect, the smoking despite his health condition, and the manipulative behavior - would be upsetting for most people.

However, I sense there might be more complexity here. Your boyfriend seems to feel a responsibility toward this younger friend who's clearly struggling (living alone at 16/17 is concerning). While your feelings are valid, perhaps approach this from a place of care rather than ultimatums. You could:

1. Express your specific concerns about his health and wellbeing
2. Set healthy boundaries together (like time limits on rides)
3. Suggest safer ways he can help her (like connecting her with support services)

You're not the asshole for being concerned, but telling him to stop completely might push him away or make him feel guilty about helping someone in need. Consider working together to find a balanced solution that respects both his desire to help and your valid concerns.",NTA,"You don't sound like someone who is trying to control your boyfriend's friendships, but rather someone who is looking out for his well-being and boundaries.

It seems like you're feeling a bit disrespected and taken advantage of, and you're trying to protect your boyfriend from being used by someone who doesn't appreciate him. Your boyfriend initially agreed with you that he should stop giving her rides, but now he's going back on that. It's natural to feel upset and confused by his change of heart. 

In this situation, it doesn't seem like you're the one who's wrong. You're expressing your concerns and boundaries in a way that's clear and reasonable. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about why he's decided to go back on his decision and how that's affecting you.",NTA,"Hey, I hear how frustrated and hurt you’re feeling. You’re protecting your boyfriend’s health and your own boundaries, and it’s understandable that the girl’s attitude and the repeated delays made you feel disrespected. Your boyfriend’s promise to stop helping her seemed like a compromise, but he’s still giving her rides because he “tired of her attitude.” That feels like a broken promise to you, so your reaction is valid.

Consider a short, calm conversation: explain why the rides are a risk for him (his airway condition) and how her behavior has made you feel unsafe and ignored. Ask him to set clear boundaries—no rides, no smoking, no long waits—unless the situation is urgent. If he still keeps the arrangement, it may signal that he’s prioritizing her over your concerns. You deserve to feel respected. If he can’t honor that, it might be worth reevaluating the relationship. Stay honest, but keep the dialogue open.",NO_VERDICT
ulchty,AITAH for not eating dinner with my mom on her birthday?,"My (16F) mom (40F) got COVID 19 a week prior to her 41st birthday. Now it’s safe to say, I absolutely despise COVID. It’s my greatest fear. I got the vaccine 3 days after it was released to teens. So, when my mom got it, I locked myself in my room refusing to eat or drink. My dad (45M) considered this outrageous, but I didn’t care. Now, three days before her birthday, my dad prepared me by saying I was supposed to eat dinner with my mom, at the same table, with no mask. Now, I wear a mask absolutely everywhere. EVERYWHERE even sometimes in my own house. I know it’s a bit concerning, but I seriously don’t care. I told my father no, I wasn’t going to eat dinner with my mom. He called me a crappy daughter, but I stuck to my morals. On the day of her birthday, I didn’t show in the dining room for dinner. My dad was pissed, and called me a piece of crap daughter. I explained how I was really scared, and he said the lines against me, that I “took care of my boyfriend when he was ill, but I can’t have dinner with my own mom” but, that was different. My boyfriend, Damion (17M) only had a headache, and tested negative 12 times! So, I was okay with taking care of him. Also, my mom had a symptom of a stomachache, and I have emetophobia. My boyfriend didn’t have a stomachache, so I was okay. But now that I think of the incident, I feel super bad. 

Also, since it’s apparently relevant, my mother hates me. She’s an awful mother, and not passionate about raising children whatsoever. I also have an underlying health conditions, leading me to be afraid. According to over 13 doctors, if I get COVID, there’s a 20% chance of hospitalization, and an 8% chance of death.

It's unfortunate that this situation has caused tension in your family, especially on a day that should have been a celebration. 

While it's important to prioritize your health, it's also valuable to communicate openly with your family about your fears and boundaries. Perhaps you could have found alternative ways to celebrate with your mom, like a virtual dinner or a heartfelt card, to show that you care while still respecting your own comfort levels.

While protecting your health is important, I wonder if there might have been a compromise possible - like having dinner in a well-ventilated space, sitting further apart, or finding another way to celebrate that felt safer to you?

It's also worth noting that your relationship with your mom is complicated. You've mentioned that she's not a passionate or caring mother, and that she hates you. This dynamic can make it even more challenging for you to navigate situations like this.

Rather than judging yourself as a ""crappy daughter,"" perhaps it's more helpful to acknowledge that you were acting out of self-preservation and a desire to protect yourself from a legitimate fear.

Your parents expect you to be present, but they’re also asking you to put your own health on the line—an unfair trade‑off. Your refusal, while painful for them, is a boundary you’re setting for your safety and mental well‑being. That said, it might help to communicate that boundary calmly—explain your fear, show you’re still caring (e.g., call or video‑chat, bring a thoughtful gift).

We haven’t had the best relationship, it has been getting increasingly worse. We haven’t been spending time together lately and it seems we no longer have anything in common. He didn’t work or help out around the house, so I have been bitching more and telling him that I am tired of supporting him in my disability. He’s perfectly capable of working he just chooses not to and when I bring it up I’m told that it is because I wasn’t encouraging of him in the past pursuing a flipping houses, that we couldn’t afford the startup, that he wanted to start because I felt it was a pipe-line dream. He hasn’t worked since then, about 5 years ago, and when I tell him we can’t afford something he wants he pouts and whines  until I get annoyed and give in putting us in financial strain. That is kinda off subject but a little background on our relationship.

Here lately he got extremely wasted and decided to call me a whore. I have a past ( when I was 13 I was SA’d and after that I did go through a faze where I was because to me it no longer meant anything and I would have rather have it away then have it taken) He claimed he didn’t remember anything from that night and after a few days I tried my hardest to forgive him. 

That brings us to last night. In an attempt to connect and spend time together I downloaded the SkyView app. When we first got together we went camping a lot and bonded over the stars. I asked him to come outside and after finding a few constellations I noticed you could still see Jupiter extremely good. When pointing it out here at first said it wasn’t so I showed him on the app. He seemed excited and was saying that it was a once in a lifetime to be able to see it that clear. He then disappeared. I stayed where I was thinking he just had to use the restroom and found some more constellations I thought he would enjoy. After about 20 minutes I went to make sure he was okay. I went into the house and he wasn’t there so I went outside and walked around a few times calling his name. After about 5 minutes our neighbors called out to me over the fence to come bring him home. That hurt me, probably more than it should that he went there to tell them to come outside and look at Jupiter with them. So I just kept walking and went back to our front door. When he finally decided I was good enough to spend time with again he tried to come back home. I told him that was the last time I would ever try spend time with him or try and reconnect again. I told him that I’m just done. He ignored everything I said and asked for a lighter so I told him to just leave. He knocked on the door until I answered and just complained that it was cold so he needed his shoes. I threw his shoes out and ignored the knocks for the rest of the night.

You tried to create a special moment, reconnecting through something that once brought you both joy, and when he left to share that moment with neighbors instead of you, it felt like the final straw.

Your husband hasn't worked in 5 years, dismisses your financial concerns, has called you hurtful names regarding past trauma, and when you try to connect meaningfully, he chooses others over you. The stargazing incident seems to symbolize the larger issues in your marriage - you reaching out and him walking away.

You're not being ridiculous. While ending a marriage is a serious decision that shouldn't be made in the heat of the moment, your feelings of hurt and frustration appear to come from long-standing issues rather than just this one incident. Consider seeking counseling - either individually or as a couple - to help process these feelings and decide on next steps in a supported way.",NO_VERDICT,"You sound like you're struggling to make sense of your decision to end your relationship, and it's understandable given the complexity of your situation.

In the context of your relationship, the incident with Jupiter seems to be the final straw. It appears that you were trying to reconnect and share a moment, but he chose to share it with your neighbors instead, which felt like a rejection.

While your friend might think you're being ridiculous, I think it's essential to acknowledge the pain and hurt you've been carrying. It's not about being 'ridiculous' but about recognizing that you deserve better and that you've reached a point where you can't continue in this relationship. 

It's also important to note that you've been trying to make it work, and it's not like you're giving up without a fight. You've been carrying the emotional and financial load, and it's exhausting. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself.

In this case, I don't think you're the 'asshole' for wanting to end the relationship. It's a difficult decision, but it might be the best one for you.",NTA,"It sounds like you’re juggling a lot of hurt and frustration at once—financial strain, unmet expectations, a painful past, and a moment that felt like a betrayal. You’re right to feel upset that he “left” you to chase a view of Jupiter while you were trying to reconnect. The fact that he chose to share that moment with neighbors instead of staying with you made you feel abandoned and disrespected.

You’re also dealing with a history of abuse that still lingers, so the “whore” comment and his drunken behavior add layers of emotional pain. All of that contributes to a feeling that you can’t trust him or rely on him to be there for you.

The decision to end a marriage is huge, but it’s not about being “the asshole”; it’s about whether you can continue to live with the pattern of neglect, disrespect, and hurt. A professional counselor or therapist—ideally one who has experience with relationship dynamics and trauma—could help you sort through the next steps. If you feel unsafe or unsure, reaching out to a local support group or hotline might be a good safety net while you figure out whether a separation or a structured effort at rebuilding is right for you.",NO_VERDICT
z1kpny,Aita For not paying off the damages to my sisters house ?,"I (17F) moved in with my sister (25F) in order to pursue my educations in a better place. So In the house it was me, her partner, and her son. At first I didn’t have a job so she payed for my food, room, and everything she could to help me while I continued my studies. As soon as I got a job, I started paying 200 for the room, and then had to start paying for my own things which I was fine with.  I pretty much had to pay for my own way of living. I was doing pretty well, and didn’t need to borrow money from anyone. On top of school, I was doing roughly 20-40 hours a week for work just to pay for my own things. Again, I was fine with this. However, my sister went on a business trip overseas, and while she was there she didn’t have enough money to book tickets to come home, as she borrowed money from her bank. I ended up forking out nearly $2,000 to help her get home, and I starved for the week she had traveled over seas because she asked if I could pay for her passport, and give any little bit I had to her. Because she is family I immediately said yes and did the best I could. She said she would pay me back as soon as she could, but as soon as I brought the money up to her her and her partner would change the subject, tell me how they had to prioritise their son, and told me I had to pay damages I did to the house. The damages I done were less than $300, $400 max. So when I deducted this from how much she owed me she started to make excuses. Not long after that she and her partner gave me a two week notice to leave the house, and it’s already been a couple of months since then. We are not on bad terms but they still expect me to pay for the damages to the house even though they are the ones that owe me. I am still trying to recover from her putting me in debt and making a living on my own, and so I feel bad that I can’t pay for the damages. Aita?

Edit: Thank you for all the advice and I have taken it on board, I will discuss it with them in person and let them know that I will not be paying for the damages, as well as take them to small claims court if they do not pay in the time they said they would (which was before the years end). I do have text messages as evidence. Her ‘business’ trip was for her own so no her job would not pay for her travels as it had nothing to do with them.

The $300-400 in damages they claim should reasonably be deducted from what they owe you, leaving them still owing you approximately $1,600. Their decision to evict you shortly after this financial dispute suggests they may have been trying to avoid repayment.

It's good that you have text messages documenting the loan. Your plan to discuss this in person and potentially pursue small claims court if needed is a mature approach.

x8e34c,AITAH For Setting Boundaries With My Brother?,"

I (29m) have two siblings, Colby 31m and Kelly 25f. Both fake names.

Growing up, Colby and Kelly always had a special bond, and I was the outlier. Of course I did my fair share of dumb shit, but whenever my brother did something wrong, he'd go get my sister, convince her I did the thing, and they'd go to my parents. Being 2 VS 1, they had no reason not to believe my siblings, but as a result, I spent a large amount of time being punished for things I didn't do.

This resulted in my brother being the golden boy, and myself being labeled as the difficult problem child.

The favoritism was and still is not subtle.

To make a long story short, Colby used to come into my room at night and molest me in my sleep. I used to wake up with my underwear around my ankles anywhere between 2 - 5 times a week. I have several vivid memories of waking up while Colby made a hasty exit out of my room.

There was at least one rape. Possibly more.

Some of the memories are very hazy being that I was either asleep, or just waking up. But I used to have wet dreams CONSTANTLY as a kid/teenager. You should be able to draw the correct conclusion from that.

Anyway, time moved on and so did I. I did my best to forgive and forget for the sake of my family. I didn't want to ruin anything we had going, which was actually really good for a while.

We just kept the closet shut so to speak.

About a year and a half or so ago, it came out that a family member, George (real name) was molesting and raping all of his kids, and had even groped Kelly a few times.

He was ejected from the family, and rightfully so.

During that time I opened up to Kelly about what Colby had done to me all growing up. We had a long heartfelt discussion, and things were good. Since then, we had a few other talks about the whole subject, mentioning Colby by name.

Now for the implosion.

Something personal happened which triggered myself and my wife to set a boundary with Colby. I went to him and him alone. Directly to him and told him we would not be allowing him to come around our two children, 5 and 7, until he owned up to what he did, apologized, and he and I went to therapy together to work through our issues and heal our relationship.

He went absolutely ballistic. Playing dumb, denying, gaslighting, victim blaming, guilt tripping, ect. If you can imagine a guilty behavior, he took it.

He then blocked me, and drove to my sister's house. He was balling and crying, saying I was teaming up with his Ex to destroy his life.

The last thing Kelly ever said to me was that Colby deserves to be heard out.

Afterwards, she blocked me on all social media and blocked my phone.

Colby also ran crying to my parents with the same sob story. They both initially believed him, but since speaking with me they're undecided.

My dad said he has a hard time believing me because he doesn't want it to be true. Which, it's good that he at least admits it, but it's not good enough.

My mom more or less believes me, but continues having contact with Kelly and Colby, stating that, ""I need to support you both,"" and, ""This is happening to BOTH my sons.""

So my sister blatantly chose my abuser knowing FULL well what he did to me, going so far as to cut contact with me and my family. And my parents are being chicken shit, saying they won't choose sides and they need to support us both because we both are having a rough time with this.

Everyone has cut ties with me except my mother. But she tells us all about the family as if nothing is going on.

Colby outright refuses to speak with me, and because I know Kelly very, very well, I know she's talking shit about me whenever she gets the chance.

The betrayal is very, very deep. And it's a wound I don't know will ever heal. The anger, rage, hate, despair, loneliness, sadness, sorrow, and loss are deep. I'm grieving the loss of my family.

I didn't know life could be so hollow.

So Reddit, Am I The Asshole?

TLDR: my brother habitually molested and raped me all throughout my childhood/teen years. My family knows the truth and decided to cut me out of the family instead of him.","God I’m so sorry you went through that. I hope you’re in therapy to help process this.

It's important to consider why she might have reacted this way. Perhaps she felt that using Super Mario as her contact photo trivialized her or your relationship. It's crucial to communicate openly and understand her perspective. A sincere apology and a conversation about why it upset her could help mend things. Let her know that you value her and didn’t intend to hurt her feelings. Relationships often require empathy and understanding, so try to see things from her point of view and reassure her that she is important to you.",NO_VERDICT,"I sense there's more to this situation than just the Mario photo. Your girlfriend's intense reaction suggests this might have touched on deeper feelings or insecurities. When you say ""I dunno"" about why you chose Mario, it could come across as dismissive of her feelings, even if that wasn't your intent.

Have you considered asking her why the Mario photo upset her so much? There might be something specific about it that bothers her - perhaps she feels it's making light of her, or she's worried you don't take her seriously. Your four-month relationship is still relatively new, and communication is especially important at this stage.

zpon98,AITA for giving my sister the silent treatment?," 

My sister, lets call her Roxy (24 f) had a large freak out last night and ended up hurting me and my siblings with what she said. For context, She has a cat and whenever she's not home we all help take care of it. Last night, she had left some few hours before its feeding time and because my other sister, Tina (23) was very very sick, I (17) was the one who had to take care o the cat and my sick sister. The only other person in the house was my little cousin who's 12 and he was out playing with his friends.

Everything was fine, I helped feed the cat and followed every other instruction she had left such as not letting it go out in the evening or not letting another neighborhood cat from coming in to the house, which I did without a problem, all the while also studying and other chores and making sure Tina wasn't getting any worse. My parents soon returned with my aunt and my mom sent me and my aunt to get some medicine at the pharmacy in light of Tina's illness. By this time it was 9PM and Roxy hadn't returned yet. When we returned it was pretty chaotic in the house as we had to prepare dinner, keep an eye on Tina and the two cats at the same time (One wanted to go out and the other stray wanted to come in). I tried my best to juggle all of these tasks at once but Roxy came back and took over dinner duty. I was pretty tired after the long day and finally decided to sit down but, my dad opened the door and the damn cat got out.

Roxy begins to freak out and starts shouting at me, my 12 y/o cousin and my sick sister. She said some pretty hurtful stuff, practically calling me useless and at one point, as I was in my room keeping something that's behind the door, she opened the door and once she saw me, shoved the door at me which ended up hurting me as the door handle hit my abdomen. She continues her rant and insults and goes out to look for the cat. About a half hour later she comes back with her cat and acts as though nothing had happened.

However what she said definitely hurt me to a whole new level. She said that I can't even help her with anything, going on about how selfish we are. I feel extremely unappreciated and as though everything I try my best to help her out of my good will go unnoticed. I decided to just return her phone as she lent it to me to use for a while and left her a note telling her how I felt about what she said. I've not talked to her since and will not talk to her until she apologizes not just to me, but to everyone. I don't think she will though. It's also not the first time. Just last month she had a fall out with my mom for whatever reason, and she was pretty cold to Tina for a better part for a year, even saying she hates her. So, am I the Asshole?","NTA 

1 she shouldn't have gone out without confirming someone was there to look after her cat. 

2 she should have had a go at your dad because he let it out not you, your cousin or Tina.

3 you are taking on too much IMO and should focus on doing the things that are important.",NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of emotions right now, and I can understand why you’d feel hurt and unappreciated after everything that happened. It seems like you put in a lot of effort to help out, especially when things were so hectic, and it’s painful when that goes unnoticed or is met with anger instead of gratitude.

Your decision to give Roxy the silent treatment could be a way to protect yourself and express how deeply her words affected you. It’s important to recognize that while your feelings are valid, communication can sometimes help resolve misunderstandings and foster healing. Perhaps when emotions have settled, having a calm conversation with Roxy could help both of you express your feelings and work toward a resolution. It might also be helpful to involve another family member as a mediator if you're comfortable with that.

Ultimately, you’re not the asshole for feeling hurt and needing space, but consider how open communication might help you both move forward.",NTA,"Based on the situation described, you're not the asshole for giving your sister the silent treatment. Your reaction seems like a reasonable boundary-setting response to verbal and physical abuse. You spent the day juggling multiple responsibilities - caring for a sick sister, managing the house, running errands, and following Roxy's pet care instructions. Despite your best efforts, when one thing went wrong (the cat getting out), Roxy responded with disproportionate anger, hurtful words, and even physical aggression by shoving the door into you.

Her pattern of behavior (previous conflicts with your mom and Tina) suggests this isn't an isolated incident. While the silent treatment isn't always the healthiest long-term communication strategy, it's understandable as a temporary protective measure when someone has been abusive. You've also clearly communicated your feelings through the note, showing maturity by expressing why you're hurt rather than just withdrawing without explanation.

Consider talking to your parents about Roxy's behavior, especially the physical incident, as this seems to be part of a concerning pattern that may need family intervention.",NTA,"You sound like you're hurt and feeling very unappreciated by your sister's actions. It's understandable that you'd feel this way, especially considering you were trying to help her and your family in a time of need. The way she spoke to you and others, and even physically hurt you, is not acceptable behavior.

I don't think you're the asshole in this situation. Your sister's behavior was hurtful and ungrateful, and it's reasonable that you'd want her to acknowledge the pain she caused and apologize. By setting a boundary and not talking to her until she does, you're taking care of yourself and standing up for your own feelings. It's not about giving her the silent treatment, but rather about taking time to heal and waiting for her to take responsibility for her actions.",NTA,"It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of hurt and exhaustion from a chaotic night. You did what you could—kept the cat, cared for Tina, and even got medicine. Roxy’s reaction was extreme and physically harmful, which is never acceptable. Taking a break from her phone and a note is a reasonable way to set a boundary and express your pain, especially if the pattern is repeated. 

You’re not automatically the asshole; you’re protecting yourself from ongoing disrespect. The next step is to let her know you’re open to a calm conversation once the heat has cooled. If she refuses to apologize, decide whether you’re willing to keep the distance for your own well‑being. Remember, healthy family dynamics require mutual respect and accountability.",NO_VERDICT

After that, i called him,demanding an explination,but all he did was change the story every time :said he was alone, when he was obviously talking with someone else,said he just left home,said hes been walking for over an hour alone and told me it was a test to see if i care about him ,after i broke up with him.
 I cant believe he would purposley hurt me like that..All bcs i kissed other boys while we weren't togheter..

The fact that he tried to punish you for what you did while you weren't even together is especially problematic. You had every right to see other people during that time. At 15, you deserve to be in relationships built on trust, respect and honest communication - not mind games and control.

I know it hurts when someone you care about deliberately tries to cause you pain, but breaking up with him was a wise decision that shows good judgment on your part. You recognized toxic behavior and set a boundary by removing yourself from the situation. That takes courage and self-respect.

It's interesting that you mention he seemed to be getting better, but this incident was a major setback. 

It's not about whether you're right or wrong in breaking up with him, but rather about recognizing that his actions were a red flag. The fact that he and his friend manipulated you, causing you emotional distress, is a sign of an unhealthy dynamic. His justification that it was a ""test"" to see if you care about him is concerning, as it implies that he values his own validation over your feelings. 

It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take a stand against behavior that hurts you.

What Will did was emotionally abusive and your mother's failure to protect you from this is very concerning. You're not wrong for standing up for yourself and your father's memory. Your painting was a healthy way to process your grief and connect with your father's memory.

It might be helpful to have a calm conversation with your mom about how you're feeling and why you reacted the way you did.

ydnz9w,AITA for posting a story of me and my stepmom and saying that she’s the best mother ever?,"A little back story: I (23f) and my stepmom Layla (57f) raised me and my brother ever since my parents divorced. I was 8 and Jayden was 2. My mother cheated with my stepfather who had kids from a previous marriage. My mom caused the divorce of my stepdad and his ex-wife. 

Side note: in my previous post I made a post about my mom and my dad fighting because my S/O Nick has severe anxiety attacks. That happened on the day that we have where we all act like a “family”.

Now onto what happened….

It was Jaydens 17th birthday and we went to this fancy restaurant and had a great time. It was me, Nick, my dad and my step mom and obviously my brother. Well we all were taking pictures and I thought I should take one of my step mom and post it. I did and in the caption it says “Layla is the best mother in the world”. Well my mom saw it and called me and I knew she was gonna yell at me which she did. She kept saying how dare I post that and how she isn’t my real mom and blah blah blah. She wanted me to take it down which I said no to. She kept on yelling till I finally hanged up on her. 

We all were having cake when my step siblings Julia and Ryan showed up. Boy was I not happy. They tried to reason with me into taking the post down. My mom had a 15 year old (Julia) and a 18 year old (Ryan) tell me a 23 year old what to do. I was utterly shocked but I said no and kicked them out. They left and I thought it was the end of it. 

Was it the end? No my mom decided to show up and yell at me and demanded I take the post down. I asked her then she should take down the posts that she has of her step kids which in the caption says “my two favorite kids in the whole world”. She said it was different and when I said again no she called me a asshole over a post (No I am not gonna post it here because it is for privacy reasons). Her husband showed up and started calling me every name in the book. Oh and her step kids showed up. They also called me an asshole. 

I told my family from my fathers side and they said I was in the right because my mom didn’t raise us Layla did. But some of the family from my moms side are angry at me and want me to delete the post. All showed up at my doorstep this morning. They said that they won’t leave me alone till I delete that post. 

Some info I want to add…Jayden decided to live with my mom for 2 years (he wanted to see what it’s like to live with my mom) but that happened when he was 10….she kicked him out when he was 12. I know she’s not a good mom…Layla raised Jayden like her own and she never did what my mom did (be neglectful).

On one hand, you don't want to burden your mom financially, but on the other hand, you did initially accept her help.

It's understandable that you're having second thoughts about asking for the money in the first place. Perhaps there's a sense of pride or guilt involved in accepting financial help from your mom, despite her insisting. I sense that you're not trying to be taken advantage of your mom's generosity, but rather, you're trying to navigate a complex situation while maintaining a sense of responsibility and respect for your mom's financial situation.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re juggling a lot—budgeting, caregiving, and the weight of your mother’s well‑being. You’re not just “uncomfortable”; you’re concerned about both your financial stability and your mom’s long‑term security. That’s a very human, responsible stance.  

Your mom’s willingness to help, even at the cost of her own “hole,” shows she cares deeply about you. Yet, honoring that offer without a clear plan can create a cycle of debt for her and stress for you.  

Consider a compromise: offer a one‑time payment for the credit‑card bill that you can afford, and set up a small, regular contribution (e.g., $50–$100) that she can comfortably keep in her own budget. If the bill is a one‑off, write it off as a gift and discuss how she can manage the $100 she would have paid for household expenses. Keep the conversation open and focus on shared goals—her financial health and your independence—rather than on blame.",NO_VERDICT
zm8jrl,AITA for being mad at my parents for keeping a secret from me my whole life?!,"I (21 F) have been told something recently by my mom that has changed my whole life and how I see myself. 
The other day I was getting tested at the hospital (I had cancer when I was little and I have to get checked yearly) and I told the doctor I’ve been struggling mentally for the last 6 months, and a little of my whole life as I found it hard to keep jobs and talk to the people in my life. I thought it was because I stopped taking my ADHD medication. After all, it was too expensive for me to take without insurance. So my doctor booked me with a psychiatrist from the government to give me less expensive medication. While I was there he told me had had to give me a stronger dose as it seemed my ADHD was worse for my age. I agreed that it seemed that I dazed off or acted differently from my friends who had ADHD and I agreed to the dose. I phoned my mom when I got home to told how much it cost and all the side effects and we kept talking for a bit. Then suddenly she mentioned something shocking. She said when I was diagnosed when I was eight the doctor, diagnosed me with something else. She told me I also had a type of social autism (no I do not know the name or anything I just found out). I was so surprised as I knew I struggled with socialization for years and I felt different from other kidscwho had ADHD, I just thought I was imagining it. As my parents always pushed me to socialize, so I thought I was good at it at one point. I asked her why she didn’t tell me and she said that she didn’t want me to live with the label and rely on it. She didn’t want me to see myself differently than others. We talked a little more and trying not to give off, I was annoyed. I already felt different my whole life. I was bullied a lot in middle school and high school, and people always seemed to dislike me because I didn’t fit in with the rest of the groups. I only ever connected with other Neurodivergent people.
I was even told by teachers, that I would never graduate high school even when I had honours. I gradually started to get angrier and angrier as more time passed thinking of all of the tools I could’ve gotten help through this condition. I always struggled with being in society, even though I was good at doing my job. I always felt awkward socializing with my coworkers or customers and I feel like inevitably that got me fired. I feel if I have seen someone when I was younger I could avoid this feeling of being separated from society, and maybe helped me with some tools to help me along the way. But what made me angry most of all is my friends or other people told me to get a diagnosis of autism, and when I told my parents, they shrugged me off, saying that a label is an easy way out. I talked to my little sister about my anger towards the situation and she told me that she kind of knew but she felt like our parents were just trying to protect me and I shouldn’t be so cross with them. I told her why I’m cross with them is because they’re always kind of blaming me for not fitting in society and won’t help me with my rent when I lose a job. After all, they want me to be independent, but they knew about my struggles before I even did and still expected me to get by without any help with this condition. She kind of agreed, but she still thought I shouldn’t be so angry. So now it’s up to you to judge. Am I the asshole?",You’re absolutely positively NTA. How did your mom expect your to react? They’ve kept a secret your who life when there was things that could of been done to help you as you grew but all they were worried about was a “label”. They also sound like they were denial for quite awhile too about it. They were more afraid of what people would/say think about you than getting you the proper help/treatment. That’s selfish AF of them.,NTA,"What does having the diagnosis change for you right now?? They lied to you for years so yes, be pissed. But you are kinda using the label as an excuse. You need to learn strategies and social skills so you can keep a job, not expect your parents to pay your rent. It sounds like your parents would not have done anything to help with autism even if they told you. Seriously, social skills are the biggest thing you need to study now. And fuck your old teachers!",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you're grappling with a lot of emotions, and understandably so. Discovering something so significant about yourself, especially when it's been withheld for so long, can be incredibly disorienting and frustrating. Your feelings of anger and betrayal are valid, especially when you consider the struggles you've faced without knowing the full picture of your own identity. It seems like your parents had intentions they believed were protective, but those actions inadvertently led to a sense of isolation for you.

It's important to recognize that while your parents may have thought they were doing what's best, their decision impacted you in ways they might not have anticipated. You have every right to feel upset about not having access to potential resources and understanding that could have helped you navigate your social experiences better.

While your sister suggests understanding their perspective, it's also crucial for you to process your feelings and communicate clearly with your parents about how their decision affected you. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor might also be beneficial as you work through these emotions and explore strategies for moving forward. Remember, your feelings are valid, and it's okay to express them.",NO_VERDICT,"Your anger is completely valid and understandable. Your parents withheld crucial medical information that could have helped you better understand yourself and access appropriate support throughout your life. While they may have thought they were protecting you from being ""labeled,"" they actually prevented you from getting tools and accommodations that could have made your life easier.

It's particularly frustrating that they dismissed your struggles and pushed you to ""fit in"" while knowing about your diagnosis. Their actions, though perhaps well-intentioned, ended up causing you additional hardship and self-doubt. You spent years feeling different and struggling without knowing why, when you could have been developing coping strategies and accessing resources specifically designed for your needs.

You're not an asshole for being angry about this. Finding out that such important information about your own health was kept from you is a significant breach of trust. While your parents may have thought they were doing what's best, you had a right to know about your own diagnosis and make informed decisions about your healthcare and life path.

Consider seeking support from autism resources and communities now to help process this revelation and access the tools you've been missing.",NTA,"It sounds like you're struggling to understand why your parents kept this secret from you for so long. You're feeling angry and hurt because you think that having this information earlier could have made a big difference in your life. It's not about the label, but about the support and tools you could have had to navigate social situations and challenges.

It's understandable that you feel your parents' decision was more about protecting themselves from dealing with the reality of your condition, rather than truly protecting you. Their actions, although well-intentioned, may have ended up causing you more harm and feelings of isolation.

It's not about being angry or not, but about acknowledging the impact their decision had on your life. You deserve to have this conversation with your parents and express your feelings. It's possible that they didn't realize the weight of their decision, and having an open and honest conversation may help you all to understand each other better.

It doesn't sound like you're the asshole in this situation. You're simply trying to make sense of your past and the choices that were made for you.",NTA,"It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of hurt and confusion in one bundle. On one hand, your parents told you they were “protecting” you from a label they thought could be a “soft‑out.” On the other, you’ve lived with the weight of being misunderstood, bullied, and left to fend for yourself without knowing the tools that could have eased that journey. That secrecy, revealed at an age when you’re trying to piece together your identity, feels like a betrayal rather than a shield. It’s understandable you’re angry—especially when people have doubted your feelings or blamed you for not fitting in. Your parents’ intention may have been misguided, but the impact on you is real. A constructive next step might be a calm, honest conversation with them, explaining how this knowledge could change your daily life and what support you need from them now.

vf1ph0,AITAH for telling my daughter to cover up?,"I (33F) am a mother of 3 kids. I have 2 boys (5 &amp; 8) and 1 girl (14). For background information, my daughter has came out as Bisexual 2 years ago and a trans male a few mother ago. I have supported her through her sexuality as I see no reason she can't date who she wants to date. But I do not believe in Transgender nor do I understand. I refuse to see her as my son as it is unnatural. My daughter has also struggled with sh since she was 9 and I've asked her to talk to me about it but she refuses. She is currently 2 months clean, and I am very proud of her for that. 

Recently, her biological father, who is not in her life, has reached out to me. We spoke on facetime and he would like to see her. Mind you, her only memory of him is picking him up from jail, so I dislike this idea. As we are talking, my daughter walks into the room. I speak up, ""Hey (daughters name) do you wanna see your biological father."" I knew she wouldn't say yes as she has no reason for wanting to see a man like him.

She said no and I asked her to leave. I ended the conversation between me and her father. I went to her room and asked her what she was going to say before. She asked me for a binder.

Those things are unsafe and she doesn't need one. I denied her the item and walked away, but she called after me. She explained that she knew how to use it safely and that it would help with her chest dysphoria. She has no chest dysphoria and I guarantee that she will mis-use the binder. I told her no and that it was the end of that discussion.

The next morning she was walking around in sweat pants and a sports bra. If she really had chest dysphoria then she would try to hide her chest. I ignored it until i saw her brothers tackling her as a game. I called her over so we could talk in private. 

I asked her why she didn't have a shirt on, it's hot she said. I still wear a shirt even though it's hot so that's a fake excuse. I tell her that she needs to put a shirt on, she asks me why. I tell her it's because boys will be boys, specifically her brothers. They may be young but they might get the wrong idea. 

That's a stupid reason she says back, there's additute lacing her voice. I tell her to stop with the attitude and to go put on a shirt, I did not raise a whore. She looks at me and says in a taunting voice, ""If you think your 5 year old is going to hurt me then you did something very wrong"" 

I yell at her to go put a shirt on and if she was a real boy like she has been trying to convince me of then she wouldn't be flaunting off her chest.

She stares at me and in a cold voice tells me ""I'm not wearing a shirt as a preventative so I can't relapse. If I did have a relapse, you would be able to see. If I don't have a shirt on I can't hide it. I don’t plan on going out like this so I see no issue not wearing a shirt in the house.""

She turns around and starts to leave, as she's walking she says ""I do wanna see my dad.""

Now I feel bad, i didn't know that she was having thoughts of relapse. But I still won't let her see her father. It's been 3 days and she hasn't said a word to me. So AITAH?

I still haven't allowed him to meet his father but we might get there eventually.",What are you asking about being an asshole for? Ignoring your *sons* sexual identity? Ignoring his chest dysphoria? Taunting him about his outfit that was fine? Saying his brothers may get the wrong idea about him for an outfit? Ignoring him and fighting him so much that he might relapse? So many ways you are an AH here. You are supposed to be a loving comfort and a place where fear and anxiety fade away. You are a supposed to make you children feel safe. So many ways YTA here.,YTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"Thank you for sharing your story. It sounds like you're navigating a complex and challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel conflicted. It's great to hear that you're taking steps toward family therapy, which can provide a safe space for both you and your child to express feelings and work through misunderstandings.

Your daughter's journey of self-discovery and expression is significant, and even if it feels unfamiliar or uncomfortable, acknowledging her identity is crucial for her well-being. It's important to continue learning about transgender experiences to better support her. Your concerns about binders are valid, and discussing safe usage with a healthcare professional might help bridge this gap.

Regarding her father's involvement, it's understandable to have reservations based on past experiences, but perhaps involving a counselor in this decision might help assess any potential benefits or risks.

Your relationship with your child is precious, and open communication, coupled with professional support, can foster understanding and healing. It's clear you care deeply, and taking these steps is a positive move toward rebuilding trust and connection.",NO_VERDICT,"Yes, you were in the wrong here, but I appreciate that you're taking steps to improve through family therapy. It's clear you care about your child's wellbeing, even if you're struggling to understand and accept their identity.

Your child has shown remarkable self-awareness and healthy coping mechanisms - both with the shirtless prevention strategy for self-harm and by being open about wanting a binder. The comments about your younger children and calling your child a ""whore"" were particularly harmful and inappropriate.

I strongly encourage you to:
1. Continue with family therapy
2. Educate yourself about transgender youth and gender dysphoria
3. Listen to your child without judgment
4. Work with medical professionals regarding binder safety
5. Support your child's mental health journey

Your child needs your acceptance and support now more than ever. The fact that you're seeking help and attending therapy shows you want to do better. Keep working on understanding and supporting your child - it will strengthen your relationship and help protect their mental health.",YTA,"I can sense the complexity of your situation, and it's clear that you're struggling with understanding and accepting your child's identity. However, your approach to handling these sensitive issues might be causing more harm than good.

It's understandable that you're concerned about your child's safety and well-being, but telling them to cover up because of their brothers is not only hurtful but also perpetuates negative stereotypes and body shaming. Moreover, denying them a binder, which they claim would help with their chest dysphoria, may be exacerbating their feelings of discomfort and distress.

Your child's explanation for not wearing a shirt in the house, as a way to prevent relapse and ensure your awareness if they do, is a valid and vulnerable reason. It's essential to prioritize their mental health and create a safe space for them to express themselves.

It's great to hear that you've taken steps towards family therapy, which is a crucial step in mending your relationship and working through these complex issues. It's also essential to consider seeking guidance from a professional who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues to help you better understand and support your child.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re juggling a lot of conflicting emotions—protective instincts, fear of relapse, and a desire to keep your daughter safe. You’re not automatically “the bad” parent for setting rules, but the way the rules are framed can feel punitive to her.

* **Clothing** – Saying “boys will get the wrong idea” is a slippery slope; it can feel like you’re policing her gender expression. Instead, frame it as a house‑rule: “We keep shirts on",NO_VERDICT
zwt4gy,AITA for refusing to speak to my sister after what she did to me on Christmas,"I (23F) recently moved into my first house and am all alone. I didn't want to be alone for the holidays so I invited my sister (20F) to come stay with me over the festive period. She came, and also brought her friend. We had a nice time, but she guilt tripped me into buying her several expensive items. Bare in mind, I don't get paid alot, i work in retail. So i went broke trying to make her christmas pleasant. On Christmas day she asked me if she could go home, because she wanted to be able to get drugs and didn't have any contacts in my area. I proceeded to shut off and said 'If you want to go then go.' She did. She left my front door wide open and asked me for money for a ride home. I felt sick and angry and i shouted at her saying 'You just left me on christmas day, and now you want money? No.'

You went out of your way to make the holidays special, even sacrificing your own financial well-being, and it's disappointing that she didn't appreciate your efforts.

It's important to set boundaries, especially when someone’s behavior negatively impacts your life. Ignoring her might seem immature to some, but it can also be a way to protect yourself from further hurt. Communication is key, so when you're ready, consider having a calm conversation with her to express how her actions affected you. This can help you both move forward, whether it means repairing the relationship or setting clearer boundaries.

Considering getting a pet is a great idea if you're looking for companionship; cats can be wonderful, affectionate friends.

It's positive that you're taking steps to build a support system with a potential pet and local friendships. Those are healthy ways to care for yourself. When you feel ready, you might consider setting clear boundaries with your sister while still keeping a line of communication open - not for her sake, but for your own peace of mind.

Remember that prioritizing your emotional and financial wellbeing isn't immature - it's self-care.

It's understandable that you're still feeling hurt and angry, and it's valid to take time for yourself to process those emotions.

Ignoring her attempts to contact you might be a necessary boundary for you right now, and it doesn't necessarily mean you're being immature.

Maybe you could discuss a compromise, like implementing a strict no-smoking rule in the new car and perhaps finding ways to freshen up the old one.

However, I sense there might be a deeper issue here about respect and communication between you and your husband. Rather than making it about restricting his access to the ""good car,"" perhaps you could approach this as a family health discussion? The focus could be on finding a solution that works for everyone - keeping the children's environment smoke-free while also acknowledging your husband's habit.

I can sense your frustration with the lingering cigarette smoke smell in the old car and how it affects you. It's understandable that you want to protect your family from secondhand smoke. By setting this boundary, you're not only looking out for their health but also trying to hold your husband accountable for his actions.

You’re not just worried about the smell—you’re worried about respect for the shared space and the health of everyone. That’s a legitimate concern, even if the other person might feel it’s an over‑reaction. A constructive next step is to frame the conversation around the kids’ well‑being and your shared household rules, rather than a personal attack. For example, say, “I’m worried about the cigarette smell in the family car and how it affects the kids’ health. Could we agree that no one smokes in that car, and if that’s hard to keep up, we’ll keep the other car for you?” That gives him a clear boundary and a concrete alternative. If he resists, consider a temporary compromise—maybe a designated “smoker’s” car for short trips—while you both work toward the no‑smoking rule.

As for your roommate, it might be helpful to reflect on whether there were any misunderstandings or miscommunications that contributed to this situation.

Finding your boyfriend and roommate cuddling, combined with him canceling plans with you to spend time with her, would naturally raise red flags about their relationship crossing boundaries.

However, making sudden decisions like evicting your roommate without notice and essentially breaking up with your boyfriend through banishment may have legal and emotional consequences worth considering. While their behavior was inappropriate, taking time to have direct conversations about boundaries and your feelings might have been a better first step.

Moving forward, I'd encourage you to reflect on what you want from your relationship with Danny. If trust has been irreparably damaged, that's valid.

Rather than blaming yourself or accepting his assessment that you're being 'psycho,' consider having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about what you need to feel satisfied and fulfilled in your intimate relationship.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re feeling hurt and dismissed, and that’s completely understandable. Wanting to finish a sexual encounter feeling satisfied is a normal expectation, and when that doesn’t happen, it can trigger frustration or disappointment. Your boyfriend calling you “psycho” and telling you you’re in the wrong isn’t a healthy response; it sounds dismissive of your feelings and a lack of empathy.

You’re not an asshole for wanting to be satisfied and for voicing that frustration. A relationship—especially the intimate part—should be built on mutual respect and open communication. Try setting aside a calm time to talk about what “getting off” means to each of you, what might be blocking it, and how you can support each other’s pleasure.

So last night i had a birthday dinner for myself and i insisted to make my family dinner because i had learned to make new dishes in cooking class in school. I made 5 dishes for my family, adobo, sushi, rice paper rolls, korean hot dogs and green tea ice cream. All of my siblings and sister in law came and wish me happy birthday and i put all of the food in the middle of the table for everyone to serve themselves. Me and my sister in law have never gotten along but i try and be nice to her but she has always hated me for no reason. Everyone was enjoying my cooking but my sister and i noticed my sister in law wasn't eating anything I made so Ivy asked ""How come you aren't eating?"" then my sister in law replied with ""None of this food is normal for my baby."" Everyone was stunned and didn't say anything. My sister in law was expecting everyone to congratulate her and shift topics about my birthday. She asked everyone why we weren't happy for her, i simply said ""Because you want the attention i'm getting, you could have told everyone your pregnant yesterday or tomorrow but of course you need the spotlight on you."" My sister chuckled a little and my sister in law got angry saying ""You can't have all of the attention on you 24/7."" you may say ""Maybe she didn't know it was your birthday."" She did know, even asked me 2 hours before what she should wear. Anyways my sister in law stormed upstairs and went into my room and locked the door. I had just gotten thousands of dollars worth of gifts that morning because my parents are very well off. We all heard glass smashing and we all bolted up stairs. My brother Matt told her to come out and they could go home and just talk everything out. She screamed at him saying ""Your sister doesn't deserve this life my baby does."" My dad rammed into the door to break it down and it didn't work the first time, so my brothers and him broke it down. I found all of my presents broken or covered in my paint. I broke down and yelled at her saying ""You just had to ruin my happy moment, I wanted one day where everyone got a long but no you ruined it."" My brother told me i should of kept quiet and just let it go because the presents can be replaced.

She locked herself in your bedroom causing your brothers to break down the door. A-hole count three.

It's understandable to feel upset when someone disrupts a celebration meant to honor you, especially when they damage your belongings. Your frustration and anger are valid, particularly when it seems like your sister-in-law intentionally shifted focus away from your birthday and caused harm.

It's important to acknowledge that while presents can be replaced, the emotions tied to the incident are significant. Your feelings matter, and it's okay to express them. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your brother and family about how this situation made you feel, emphasizing the emotional impact rather than just the material loss.

In terms of the broader family dynamics, it might be beneficial to seek support from your parents or a counselor to navigate these complex relationships.

You're not alone in this, and seeking understanding and support from those around you can be a positive step forward.",NO_VERDICT,"I'll respond with empathy while staying focused on the core issue:

I'm so sorry this happened during what should have been a special celebration of your birthday. It's completely understandable that you're upset - you put effort into cooking a lovely meal for everyone and had your personal belongings deliberately destroyed. Your sister-in-law's behavior was extremely inappropriate and destructive, both emotionally (trying to hijack your birthday) and physically (damaging your property).

While yelling isn't ideal, having an emotional reaction to such an extreme situation is completely normal, especially at 14. You're not the problem here - you're dealing with an adult who acted very immaturely and destructively. The fact that her family is now harassing you instead of addressing her concerning behavior is also inappropriate.

I'd encourage you to:
1. Let your parents handle the legal/adult aspects
2. Block anyone sending harassing messages
3. Talk to your parents or a counselor about how this has affected you

I can sense your frustration and pain, especially since you had been trying to be nice to her despite your past difficulties. Your reaction, screaming at her, might have been intense, but it seems like it was an emotional response to a very hurtful situation. 

It's understandable that you wanted one day where everyone got along, and her actions ruined that for you. While your brother might think you should have kept quiet, it's also important to acknowledge your feelings and validate your experience. The fact that her family is now gaslighting and bullying you adds to the complexity of the situation. In this context, I wouldn't say you're entirely in the wrong for reacting the way you did.",NTA,"It sounds like a cascade of misunderstandings and hurt feelings, rather than a single “right‑or‑wrong” moment. You invested time and effort into a birthday celebration and felt your sister‑in‑law’s refusal to eat and her comments as a personal slight. In turn, she reacted with anger and an explosive outburst that damaged your gifts. Both sides reacted emotionally—yours by yelling, hers by smashing. The key issue is that neither side considered how the other might feel. Your family’s frustration is understandable, but the escalation was avoidable. A calm, mediated conversation—perhaps with a neutral family member or counselor—might help each of you express why you felt hurt and find a path to repair the damage.

 I(22f) have been with my bf (22m) for 4 years. Yesterday i was at launch with my bf, bff and bff's bf. The topic of abortion came along and me, my bff and her bf said that abortion laws are bs but my bf said he agrees with them because it's killing a baby. He said that of a woman doesn't want babs she should use protection. I told him that birth control and condoms are 100% effective and his response was ""then they shouldn't have sex"". I did not want to cause a scene in public so i didn't say anything. When we got home he proceeded to try and get me to have sex with him but i said no because i don't want kids. We had a huge fight and i left. He told his parents and they told my parents and now all are blowing up my phone calling me an AH for refusing to sleep with him. I explained the situation and they said that I'm still an AH and it's not fair because in our stat they're still legal. My bf texted apologizing for his comment and he said he realized it was very disrespectful. Idk. It's not the first time he said something sexist/misogynistic/offensive about women and apologized to get what he wants. Idk if i believe he's actually sorry. Fells like he's only saying it so i would come home and have sex with him. So idk. AITAH ?

UPDATE!
I called him and a girl answered the phone. When my bf well ex now, came to the phone he said ""i wasn't going to wait for you to come to your senses and move your bitchy ass back home. I wanted sex, i got it."". And then proceeded to apologize because it was just sex and meant nothing to him. So yeah. I guess I'm single now....","Wait.

The fact that your ex quickly moved on and was disrespectful to you further validates your feelings about the relationship. It seems like you made the right decision by stepping away from a situation that wasn't healthy for you. Remember, you deserve to be with someone who respects your opinions and boundaries, and who supports you rather than pressures you.

The fact that both sets of parents are pressuring you about your sexual choices is completely inappropriate and concerning.

Your ex-boyfriend's true colors came out in multiple ways:
1. His dismissive views about women's reproductive rights
2. His pattern of making sexist comments then apologizing only to get what he wants
3. His ultimate betrayal by cheating on you when you stood your ground
4. His cruel and degrading way of telling you about the cheating

While this is painful now, you dodged a bullet.

yt0elf,AITA for telling my wife that I know how someone died and am not allowed to tell her?,"My wife asked me how my brother-in-law's dad died after we attended the funeral. She has never met the guy and her morbid curiosity bugged me, so I said ""Have some respect."" She continued prodding so I told her that I actually do know, but that the person who told me said that  I couldn't tell anyone else. Fast forward 2 days and she's getting more upset and I'm afraid to admit it was just a prank. I don't even know if she will believe me when I do come clean.

**Update: I'm remembering that my sister had texted my family (including my wife and I) that the death may have been from a blood clot. And now I'm realizing that maybe I didn't want my wife to start asking if the clot was related to a booster.

It’s commendable that you’ve recognized how your past with your ex might have impacted your response to your wife. Acknowledging this is a big step towards ensuring it doesn’t affect your relationship moving forward.

Your wife’s curiosity, while it may have seemed morbid, likely came from a place of wanting to connect and understand more about your family. By coming clean and apologizing, you’ve taken responsibility and shown a willingness to improve communication with her. It’s important to remember that honesty and openness are crucial in maintaining trust in any relationship.

Continue to communicate openly with your wife about your feelings and past experiences. This can help her understand your perspective and strengthen your bond.

It's positive that you've gained insight into why you reacted this way and have taken responsibility by apologizing to your wife. Death is a topic that naturally brings up curiosity in many people, and your wife's questions weren't necessarily disrespectful - she may have been trying to process the loss or connect with your family's experience.

Moving forward, being honest about your discomfort with certain topics and working through your past triggers would be healthier than creating stories.

By telling her you were forbidden to talk, you shifted the conversation from honest sharing to secrecy, which understandably hurt her. Recognizing that your annoyance with an ex influenced the way you handled her question shows insight—and that’s the first step toward repair.

I hear frustration in your question about whether you're wrong for pursuing what was supposedly allowed. However, rather than focusing on who's ""right"" or ""wrong,"" it might be more helpful to explore what this reaction reveals about your relationship.

I sense that there might be some mixed signals or unspoken expectations in your communication.

It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with J about why he feels uncomfortable and address any insecurity or misunderstanding. Emphasize the platonic nature of your friendship with B and reassure J of your commitment to him. Relationships thrive on trust and communication, so finding a way to address both your needs and concerns might help resolve the tension. Ultimately, you should not feel forced to choose between a long-standing friendship and your relationship; instead, strive for understanding and compromise.",NO_VERDICT,"Let me share my perspective on this situation. You're not the asshole for maintaining a longstanding, platonic friendship. Your boyfriend's reaction seems rooted in insecurity and control issues, rather than legitimate concerns.

A few key points stand out:
- You've been transparent about B's existence from the start
- B's sexual orientation makes romantic concerns unreasonable
- Your boyfriend is making an unfair ultimatum
- The friendship predates your relationship with J

It's concerning that J is trying to isolate you from a supportive friendship, especially one that has helped you through difficult times. Healthy relationships are built on trust and respect, not control and ultimatums. 

If J truly cares about you, he should be willing to have an open discussion about his insecurities rather than demanding you cut off important relationships. Consider this reaction a potential red flag - someone who truly loves you shouldn't force you to choose between them and other meaningful connections in your life.

Stand firm in maintaining your friendship with B while remaining open to discussing J's concerns constructively.",NTA,"You sound torn between your loyalty to your long-time friend B and your commitment to your relationship with J. It seems like B holds a special place in your heart, and you value the support and connection you've shared over the years. On the other hand, J's reaction and ultimatum have put you in a difficult spot.

I sense that you feel J's request is unreasonable, especially given that B is gay and you've never felt any romantic attraction towards him. It's like you're being asked to choose between a deep and meaningful friendship and a romantic relationship that's suddenly become conditional.

Rather than wondering if you should have just dropped B, I'd like to explore why J's reaction is causing you so much distress. Is it possible that J's insecurity and possessiveness are triggering feelings of resentment or frustration in you? How do you feel about being given an ultimatum, and what does it say about the dynamics of your relationship with J?",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re caught between two people who mean a lot to you. On one hand, J’s hurt is understandable—he’s feeling blindsided and maybe even insecure about a close female friend who’s been in your life for years. On the other hand, B has been a reliable confidant through tough times, and you’re legitimately unsure about cutting someone out just because of a gender misunderstanding. A good next step is to ask J what specifically makes him uncomfortable: is it the gender of the friend, the fact that you didn’t state it earlier, or a deeper fear that B might influence you? If it’s a miscommunication, a brief, honest conversation with both of them might clear it up. If J’s discomfort is about “the idea of a close guy friend,” you might need to decide whether that’s a boundary you’re willing to adjust. Either way, honest dialogue—without blame—can prevent the situation from escalating into a breakup or a broken friendship.",NO_VERDICT
waxfkm,AITAH for telling my future sister in-law that no one cares that she is pregnant?..,"For context I 17(F) have been in a relationship with my 18(M) boyfriend since the fifth grade. My boyfriends sister 23(F) has been married to her husband 24(M) since she was 18, she currently has 3 kids a set of twins 4(M) and 4(F) along with her 2(F) daughter, I get along with her kids very well and my boyfriend loves this that I'm close with my future nieces and nephew. But my problem is a couple of weeks ago I was babysitting for her as her and her husband went out on a date I heard the twins talking about how they're getting a new sibling. I looked at them all confused and asked ""What do you mean by that?"" They look at me as they smile and say ""Mommy said she is pregnant!"" I look at my neice and nephew in shock.

And a few days later was a family reunion because it was an urgent matter involving my 8(M) nephew's recent health problems, so we all arrive at reunion I was invited for obvious reasons. I can see my 29(F) sister-in-law about ready to cry along with her husband 30(M) comforted her as he squeezed her hand. I grab my boyfriend's hand for comfort because I know something bad is about to happen ""You all know that everyone is here because of our son.. we found the reason why he is so sick.."" my sister-in-law bursts into tears as I  go to get up and comfort her, hear something I wish I had never heard in my entire life ""My cancer had passed to are son and he is at stage three.."" her husband starts tearing up.

After that sentence I feel physically ill and my boyfriend said I looked physically ill as well, my brother had cancer and just barely survived and I myself had that Gene it was caught early on so I was okay. My other sister-in-law seems very slightly sad by this news she starts fidgeting in her seat and I was just waiting for her to say something, her husband whispered to her seemingly begging her not to do something, I narrow my eyes at her as she slowly gets up and started to speak ""I'm sorry that we had to tell you this way but it's urgent... I'm pregnant again!"" And she said that with a huge smile on her face not even thinking about what my other sister-in-law and her husband feel that their child was diagnosed with cancer. 

At this point all I was seeing was red my anger had bubbled up like a volcano ready to spew, I waited a few more words before I said my choice of words ""we wanted to tell you before the gender reveal happens."" After that I lost it I stood straight up from my chair as it scraped across the floor I glared at her ""you are an insensitive b*tch your sister told you that your nephew has cancer and you decide now is the time to tell everyone that you're pregnant no one cares that you're pregnant your nephew is sick and all you can do is be selfish!"" 

After that most of my boyfriend's family look at her with displeased look and shaking of there heads most of the family is on my side including my boyfriend my sister-in-law and her husband along with my mother-in-law and father-in-law. but my boyfriend's aunt sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband and a few other relatives are angry at me for causing stress to a pregnant woman and saying that she could miscarry from the stress I caused her. I feel no remorse or regret for what I said. But I think I took it just a little bit too far, I am very close with my 8(M) nephew he even calls me auntie. I'm very attached to him he even has the same cancer as me and my brother (Liver cancer) 

To make him feel better I got my brother and myself to go to the hospital for my nephew and we showed him our scars I told him the one thing I knew that would cheer him up, I told him ""Only superheroes get really sick so they can pass their trial for their powers I passed and I know you're going to pass as well!"" I never saw him smile as much as he did after  I said that, he started rambling about how cool his powers where gonna be. (To this day I'm still getting angry text and phone calls from my sister-in-law telling me I'm an asshole and that she can miscarry from the stress I have causing her) So am I the asshole?..

EDIT: I have severe social anxiety I can barely get through a conversation most of the time(Unless I am comfortable with that person) {I have never met some of these family members I was supposed to meet them at the reunion} , also I have a fear of talking in front of a lot of people, Some of you have been saying I spoke up to get the attention on myself which is completely untrue I wanted to get the attention back on my nephew's health. And I understand what I did was 'Wrong' but I couldn't let her brush over the fact that our nephew is sick.

The reason why I was so mad I had a family gathering as well when my mother told my family that I was sick, and my sister actually announced her pregnancy after our mother told the family. I was immediately looked over and the attention went straight to her, I said nothing as this happened I was just quiet the only one who didn't give her any attention was my brother he was actually hugging me. I only said that because I didn't want the same thing to happen to my nephew the same reason I was ignore well I had cancer for 9 months as all the attention went to my sister",Who the fuck thinks that it’s the right time to announce a pregnancy when finding out that your nephew has cancer? SIL is an attention wh*re,NO_VERDICT,Some people are literally just that self absorbed. They don’t have feelings for anyone else’s experiences. My sister is like this. The attention must absolutely remain on her regardless of the circumstances. This sister sounds similar to my ears. I’m so sorry this unnecessary drama is occurring during a serious crisis. I’m so sorry. You sound like a great source of support for this little guy. And your super hero analogy is spot on! You are a great champion for him and I think you have a little best friend for life. How is your recovery going? Are you healing well? Fingers crossed for all of you.,NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you've been through a lot, both with your personal experiences and within your family. It's understandable that you felt a strong emotional response to the situation, especially given your history with cancer and the way your family dynamics played out in the past.

You were trying to protect your nephew and ensure that his serious health condition received the attention and support it deserved. It's clear that your intentions came from a place of care and empathy for your nephew's situation. However, the way you expressed your feelings might have been perceived as harsh, especially during an emotionally charged family gathering.

Navigating family dynamics, especially in such difficult circumstances, is challenging. It might help to have a calm, private conversation with your sister-in-law to explain your feelings and apologize for the way your message was delivered, if not the sentiment behind it. This could help mend relationships and provide an opportunity to focus on supporting your nephew and his family during this challenging time.",NO_VERDICT,"Based on the emotional context and complexity of this situation, I can understand your strong reaction. While your sister-in-law's timing for her pregnancy announcement was incredibly insensitive, your explosive response, though coming from a place of protection and past trauma, may have escalated the situation.

Your personal experience with cancer and watching your nephew face the same battle clearly influenced your emotional response. The fact that you later helped cheer up your nephew with the superhero story shows your genuine care and understanding of what he's going through.

Instead of the confrontational approach, you might have pulled your sister-in-law aside privately later to explain why her timing was hurtful. However, your reaction, while intense, did succeed in refocusing attention on your nephew's serious health situation, which was the priority at that moment.

You're not an asshole for standing up for your nephew, but there may have been a more constructive way to handle it. Consider apologizing for the delivery of your message, while standing firm on why the timing of her announcement was inappropriate.",NTA,"You're clearly still grappling with the emotions surrounding that intense family gathering. It's understandable that you felt compelled to speak up, especially given your personal connection to the situation. Having gone through a similar experience with your own cancer diagnosis and feeling overlooked when your sister announced her pregnancy, it's natural that you wouldn't want the same thing to happen to your nephew. Your reaction, though laced with anger, was also driven by a desire to protect him and ensure his health wasn't overshadowed.

While your words may have been hurtful, it's essential to acknowledge that your sister-in-law's timing was indeed insensitive, especially given the gravity of the news that had just been shared. It's not necessarily about being the 'asshole,' but rather about navigating a complex web of emotions and family dynamics. However, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of your words on your sister-in-law, even if her actions were thoughtless. Perhaps finding a way to address the situation that balances empathy with assertiveness might be a more constructive approach moving forward.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you were in a whirlwind of emotions—shock at the cancer news, grief for your nephew, and frustration that the attention shifted to a new pregnancy. Your reaction was understandable, but the way it was expressed—calling her an “insensitive bitch”—was harsh and likely hurtful. In family situations, especially with sensitive health issues, a calm, factual approach can help keep everyone focused on the priority (your nephew’s care) without alienating others. A brief apology for the tone, followed by a clear explanation of why you felt the conversation needed to stay on the nephew, would show that you care about her feelings as well. Remember, your nephew’s well‑being is the priority, but the way we communicate about it can either support or strain the relationships that help keep him safe.",NO_VERDICT
visfkz,AITAH for throwing my husband out?,"For some context I (34 F) am married to Luca (32 M). We have been together for 7 years. We recently got married. I have been the bread winner in the house all our relationship. I got him his own apartment after 6 months of us dating because he was having financial trouble. Me making the money is never something I would hold over his head. I don’t need him to have money I just need him to love me for me. 

I work in the military. My job is vary important to me because I have spent so much of my life working to get where I am. Luca does not work and we do not have children. I have never once asked him to do more them pick up the house. 

I am out of town and country a lot for work. I told Luca when he proposed that I work a lot and I may not be home all the time. I still pay all the bills and I payed off both our cars. I leave him with money when I know I will be gone. So it’s not like I am just leaving him to fend for himself. He has a car and money when I am gone. I am out out town a lot so we do not have the most sex. He brought up the idea of and open marriage. Although I am not the most comfortable with it I agreed. I understand that I can not meet all his needs. 

I had been gone for six months. When I came home he was with a woman but I had not told him I was not coming home so i understood. I waited downstairs in the living room till they finished. When they where done he came downstairs and saw me. He waved goodbye to his partner and that was that. He want upstairs and showered and I made us dinner. 

When he was clean I went to hug him. He pushed me away and told me he does not want me touching him. We pulled an envelope out of the kitchen drawer. 
Divorce papers. 
He said “I can not be in this one sided marriage you are always working and you ask to much of me when you are not here I do not love you anymore” 

I was shocked i got upset and maybe I was a little to mean 
I told him “you act like a needy child I’m sorry I can’t be down your
fucking throat all the time I’m out there working to support you. I don’t ask much of you. I just wanted you to love me. Get the fuck out of my house” 

He went on to tell me I was a bitch and that I can’t kick him out and that he has no  where to go. I left and stayed in a hotel. The next day I want him and gave him all the cash I had on me I took (500$) out at the ATM that morning , packed his shit and threw him out. I let him keep the car. 

In the end I told my friends and family and most of them said I was the asshole. They said I did not have to put him in the street. That I know he is not stable and that I should not have handled it that way.

I see that I should not have blown up on him but I was upset. 

So,AITAH for throwing out my husband?","NTA. 

I'm sorry to break this to you, but he was stepping out long before he suggested an open marriage. You've been feeding, sheltering and catering to a manipulative asshole. 

I genuinely hope you do not go back on this decision. Cut contact with people that will talk about him and tell you you were an asshole, because you were not. Change locks, get a security camera for when you're away. Block him everywhere and make sure there's no social interaction between you two. If some of his things are left behind, take them to a friend's place or his folks. Maintain your distance.",NTA,,NO_RESPONSE,"It sounds like you're going through a really tough and emotional situation. From what you've shared, it seems you were blindsided by his request for a divorce and his hurtful words. It's understandable that you reacted strongly, given the circumstances. Being in a relationship where you feel you're giving a lot, emotionally and financially, and then being told it's one-sided can be incredibly painful.

It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel angry and hurt. However, it might be beneficial to reflect on how the situation was handled. While your reaction was intense, it came from a place of deep emotional pain and betrayal. Offering him money and the car shows you did consider his immediate needs despite the anger.

Consider seeking support from a counselor or a therapist to navigate these emotions and help you find closure. Also, remember that relationships are complex, and it's okay to take time to process everything. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and loved.",NO_VERDICT,"Let me respond with empathy while addressing the key aspects of your situation:

You're not the asshole here. You've supported this man for years - financially, emotionally, and even accommodated an open marriage arrangement to meet his needs while you were away for work. Despite your sacrifices and commitment, he chose to serve you divorce papers in a particularly cold way, after you caught him with someone else (which was within the agreed arrangement).

What's striking is that instead of showing gratitude for your support or having an honest conversation about his feelings earlier, he waited until you returned home to blindside you. Your emotional reaction, while intense, was understandable given the circumstances. You even provided him with cash and a car when asking him to leave - showing consideration even in your hurt and anger.

It's understandable that you felt the need to set boundaries and assert your own needs. However, I also see where your friends and family are coming from.

It's not necessarily about being an asshole or not, but rather about taking a step back to reflect on whether your actions aligned with your values and the kind of person you want to be. You mentioned that you don't need him to have money, but rather to love you for who you are. That desire for love and connection is valid, and it's painful that Luca didn't meet you halfway.

z9nms9,AITA for ruining my brother’s baby shower/gender reveal,"This is a throwaway account as I have family and friends linked to my main account.

I 28M, and my wife 25F have had an overall good marriage (other than a few small fights). We have been married for 5 years and together for 7. Recently, my family has come to a disagreement about this situation so I thought I’d post it here and get some non-bias opinions.

Last weekend, my brother 30M and his girlfriend 29F were having their baby shower/gender reveal. They’ve been together for 6 years and have broken up a few times due to my brother having anger issues but they always sorted it out. Me and my wife were both invited to the baby shower but my wife was surprisingly hesitant to go. I waved this off as she had recently suffered a miscarriage (although we have 2 healthy kids) and I thought she was just upset about all the baby related stuff.

Eventually, after speaking to her she agreed to go. I’d like to add that my brother was the one that introduced me to my wife as they were colleagues when they worked a part time job together.

So at 2pm we drove half an hour to attend and everything seemed to be going well. There was always some sort of tension between my wife and my brother’s girlfriend, but I never thought anything of it as my wife and my brother are still close friends.

About half way through, I noticed my wife was on her phone a lot and so was my brother and stealing glances at each other. I thought they were maybe planning a surprise for my brothers girlfriend so I asked my wife what she was doing. She was surprisingly dismissive (she has never been secretive about her phone or her passwords) so I just left it.

About 10 minutes later, my wife tells me she’s going inside to go to the bathroom and my brother tells his wife he’s going to get more drinks for the guests. I start speaking to my cousin and note my wife’s strange behaviour.

After 30 minutes of my wife not coming back out, I started to get worried so I went to check on her. I obviously look in the bathroom first and find it’s empty. I then look in the kitchen thinking she might be helping my brother with the drinks but they’re both nowhere to be seen. I started to get a bad feeling about this so I searched the whole house and when I got to my brother’s bedroom the door was locked but I heard my wife’s voice so out of anger, I broke down the door (for reference I am 6’2 and go to the gym 5 times a week) there, I find my overweight brother on top of my beautiful wife. I thought he was trying to suffocate her (no offence but hes 5’3 and 20 stone) and I pulled him off of her. I then realised that they were both naked and about to have sex. I punched that fat cunt in the gob and stormed out the room.

I was blinded with rage, I stomped out to the baby shower and announced to everyone what they were doing. His girlfriend started sobbing uncontrollably and I heard my wife and brother coming outside and I started shouting at them both while everyone was watching. Here is where I might be the asshole, while I was shouting at them, I pointed out how my brother can’t even afford a baby because he’s too obese to work a proper job and his girlfriend deserves better. My wife was also sobbing and apologising and out of anger I called her a bitch and a whore. I went into my car (I drove me and my wife to the house so she had no way of getting back other than uber) and I paid the babysitter and started thinking about my next steps. My wife came back in an uber and we aren’t on speaking terms as I’m upset with her for cheating and she’s upset with me for calling her a bitch. She’s sleeping in the guest bedroom and mainly taking care of the kids (she doesn’t work and I take care of bills).

I’m getting a lot of backlash on facebook from friends and family saying I escalated the situation and saying I could’ve handled it better. The only people agreeing with me are my in-laws (my wife’s parents) and my cousin that was also at the baby shower. I’m writing this to get all my thoughts down and get myself together and maybe get some advice on this situation.

Should I divorce? Do I go to couples therapy?  Should I cut off my family? What about the kids?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","I dont see how this is even a question for you. It's bad enough your wife was cheating with your brother but they couldn't even hold off at the baby shower where your whole family was gathered?

It's understandable that you'd feel a whirlwind of emotions right now—anger, betrayal, and confusion are all valid feelings given the circumstances.

While your reaction at the baby shower was intense, it's important to remember that emotions can be overwhelming in such shocking situations. However, moving forward, it might be beneficial to take a step back and consider the best course of action for you and your children. Talking to a therapist, either individually or as a couple, could help you navigate your emotions and decide on the next steps, whether that involves reconciliation or separation.

Regarding your family and social circle, it could be helpful to focus on those who are supportive and understand your perspective, while taking time to reflect on how to address the relationships with those who are critical.

Ultimately, think about what will bring you peace and stability in the long run, especially for your children's sake. Take your time to process everything, and don't hesitate to seek professional guidance to help you through this challenging time.",NO_VERDICT,"Let me acknowledge how devastating and traumatic this situation must be for you. Discovering infidelity, especially with your own brother and at such a significant family event, is incredibly painful. Your intense emotional reaction is completely understandable given the circumstances.

While the public confrontation may not have been ideal, you were reacting to an extreme betrayal in the moment. Both your wife and brother violated your trust in a profound way, and the fact that this happened at his baby shower/gender reveal makes it even more egregious.

As for next steps, I would recommend:
1. Take some time to process your emotions, possibly with a personal therapist
2. Consider the children's wellbeing as your primary focus
3. Consult with a divorce attorney to understand your options
4. Hold off on major decisions until you can think more clearly

Couples therapy might be worth considering only if you're both committed to rebuilding trust and your wife shows genuine remorse. However, given the circumstances and the involvement of your brother, rebuilding that trust would be extremely challenging.

It could be beneficial to seek individual therapy to work through your feelings and develop a plan for moving forward.

As for your marriage, it's worth considering couples therapy to address the underlying issues that led to your wife's infidelity. It's not just about the act itself, but also about the communication breakdown and emotional disconnection that may have contributed to it.

Regarding your family, it might be helpful to take a break from them for now and focus on your own healing. However, cutting them off entirely might not be the best solution, especially considering your children's relationships with their relatives.

There were people cheering me on, there were people telling me i should be ashamed of myself, it was so much. Long story short i got suspended for 3 days. He didnt get in trouble      

Update: he got iss. today after school, stacy told me he got iss for three days. thats fine i guess but dont u think he shouldve got into more trouble than me?

Update: he went to the hospital. the day i smacked him. his nose was bleeding to much he passed out. 

AITA?","NTA

And I agree with your punishment.  3 days suspension,  I really hope that your Mom/Dad wear you out, by taking you to Build a Bear, the candy store and ice cream shop

Poor little boy should have gotten his nose absolutely flattened like a passover bread! The fact that he only went to the hospital for passing out is a shame.  He should have been expelled for a terror threat which,  when just stating, he wanted to rape a girl, it is.  Any actions past that should equal jail time, he better not touch her.

This is probably done by a male principal,  uggg.  

I am a 56m, happily married with 4 boys.  I catch one of my boys doing this stuff there will be one less at the dinner table tonight and he will be drinking steak through a straw for a  few weeks. 


I am not prone to violence, but this is so wrong on so many levels.

It’s clear you care deeply about Stacy and wanted to stand up for her. It's understandable to be angry when someone makes such an inappropriate and harmful joke, especially about something as serious as that.

However, it's important to consider how we respond to difficult situations. Violence can escalate situations and lead to unintended consequences, as you've seen with the boy's injury and your suspension. It's crucial to find ways to address these issues that don't involve physical confrontation. In the future, you might consider speaking with a teacher, counselor, or another trusted adult who can help address the situation appropriately. 

Reflecting on how you can handle these situations differently in the future can be a valuable learning experience. It's okay to feel angry and protective, but finding constructive ways to express those feelings can be more effective.",NO_VERDICT,"While I understand your strong protective instinct for your friend, physical violence isn't the right solution, even when responding to deeply inappropriate and threatening ""jokes.""

I can sense how angry and protective you felt about your friend, but hitting someone can have serious consequences - as you've seen with both his injury and your suspension. The fact that he went to the hospital shows how physical confrontations can quickly escalate beyond what we intend.

Instead of taking matters into your own hands, I encourage you to:
1. Report threatening behavior to trusted adults
2. Support your friend by being there for her
3. Document incidents of harassment
4. Learn about your school's proper channels for addressing threats and harassment

While I understand your anger, it's essential to consider the consequences of your actions, especially in a public setting. Physical violence can escalate situations and lead to more harm, as seen in the boy's hospitalization. It's also worth noting that you received a harsher punishment than the boy initially, which might seem unfair.

It's great that you're reflecting on your actions and considering what could have been done differently. A better approach might have been to report the incident to a teacher or school authority, allowing them to handle the situation and provide support to Stacy. This way, you could have still stood up for your friend without resorting to physical violence.",NO_VERDICT,"It sounds like you’re in a really painful spot—your friend threatened her in a horrible way, and you felt it was the only thing you could do to protect her.

Will I skip my friends funeral for something that'll happen like every school year?"" Then she stopped talking... am I an ass for choosing to go to my friends funeral rather than my sons open house at school? Or should I go to my sons thing and miss the funeral? Kinda feel like I'd be the bad guy at home if I missed his open house but then I'd feel like shit for choosing to have fun rather than going to my friends funeral. 

This is my first ever post so I’m not sure if I’m posting in the right place. Sorry

Update: I didn’t realize how much feedback I got on this. But I appreciate everyone’s opinions even the ones saying I’m the AH. The way I asked the question could’ve definitely been in a better way but it caught me off guard as my friend had just died 2 days before I made this post. I did talk to her and she said it’d be best that I go to the funeral and she’d just take him to his open house because I’d regret not going to my friends funeral and she even helped me shop for some clothes too. She knows how I am with this.. I’ve only missed 2 out of 7 funerals because they were super far away. But again thank you everyone for your inputs. Really helped me to believe my decision to go to the funeral wasn’t the wrong decision.","As a former teacher, I think you should go to the funeral. School policies will be on handouts and you can reach out to the teacher and say “I had to miss the open house due to a funeral, but I would like to meet you.

It’s important to have open communication in situations like these, and it’s great that you both discussed it and came to an agreement that considered your feelings and obligations.

Your wife's later support shows she understands the significance of this loss, and it's wonderful that she's helping you navigate this situation. She's right - there will be other open houses, but you only get one chance to say goodbye to your friend and support their family.

The key here wasn't about choosing between being a good father or a good friend - it was about handling the communication with more empathy. Your wife probably just needed reassurance that you value these family moments, even when extraordinary circumstances prevent you from attending.

It's also interesting to note that your wife recognizes your tendency to prioritize funerals and has taken steps to support you in this decision. It seems like you both have found a compromise that works for your family, with her attending the open house and you attending the funeral.

In this case, it doesn't seem like you're being an ""ass"" for choosing to attend the funeral. Rather, you're being honest about your priorities and values, and your wife is showing understanding and support.",NAH,"It sounds like you’re in a genuinely tough spot, and you’re not alone in feeling torn. A funeral is a serious, often final, obligation, while a preschool open‑house is a routine school event that you can usually reschedule or miss without long‑term impact.

That’s understandable, but it doesn’t automatically make you the AH.  

You’ve already taken a thoughtful step by asking your friend to cover the open‑house and by buying new clothes with her help. That shows you’re trying to balance both responsibilities.

wifu6o,AITA for ending a 11 year friendship because i found out he was lying to me?,"I (22M) had a friend since childhood. We grew up in the same neighborhood, and he was the first friend i made when i moved there. We did everything together, from playing sports to running from the neighbors... He was there for me when my parebts died, when my grandpa died, and when my sister killed herself. Since we were so close, i was always referring to him as my little brother, and that's what he would tell people. Two years ago, i got into a relationship and felt happiness for the first time in a long time. I felt like i wasn't alone, and my dark thoughts left my mind. That's when i noticed change in his behavior. He started to intrude any time he could, and when i would tell him i wanted some alone time with my gf, he would get mad. 

Now, he's 20 years old, but due to poor hygiene, he has black teeth, and always stays at home playing video games. I would take him anywhere because he was my best friend and i wanted him to go outside as much as possible. He doesn't have many friends and i kinda felt bad for him.

Anyways, back to the story. At the beginning of tgis year, i come to find out that he was lying to my now ex about me being jealous of some random guy (i'm never jealous, and i don't even know the guy), and he was telling me all that time that she was cheating on me with that guy (i didn't believe him bc i'm from a small town and i'm close with her brother). He would always tell me she's with that guy even when she isn't. When i broke up with her, because of the distance, he told her it was because i was jealous. Fast forward to a week ago, i confronted him about it, and after yelling at him, he finally confessed that he did that because he liked her, and that he felt no guilt whatsoever. I immediately told him that we're done for good, and he went on to tell a mutual friend that he doesn't understand why i'm mad and that he did nothing wrong (WTF). He never apologized and if i didn't ask him, he wouldn't have even told me. So, AITA for ending things with him?","NTA.

wzaatz,AITA For not seeing my ex after he travelled for 10+ hours to see me…,"So, I (27 F) have been talking to a guy (27 M) for 2+ years. I live in the U.K. and he lives in America. 

We met online a couple of years ago and over the course of two years we’ve called/FaceTimed/messaged. 

Things have happened over the 2 years such as him being dishonest about speaking to others and being intimate with other girls. I found out about one girl which ultimately lead to us ending. Then we were on and off throughout the 2 years. 

One day while we were talking on the phone (we were off at this time) he told me he was flying to the U.K. to see me. At first, I was excited to him as it had been so long that we’d had a relationship over the phone I was happy to see him. However, we argued on the days leading up to the visit and I told him not to come as he said he never wanted to speak to me again. I thought that was the end of it all until… he showed up the next day. 

I was shocked that he’d come but agreed to meet up as he’d spent so much money coming over here. When we hung out on was ok. He was quiet and we didn’t speak much because of the tension from the argument. 

The day after he said he’d met some people who offered to go take him out drinking. I went to work (I can choose my hours at the moment as it’s summer), told him to have a good time and didn’t think anything of it. He then argued with me about it because he wanted to see me instead. This argument lead to him saying he’d been intimate with someone in the U.K. when I had been to work and threatened to send me the evidence… 

I was obviously furious and said I would not be seeing him anymore. I blocked him but he managed to call me on a blocked number. He told me he said that to hurt me because I’d hurt his feelings by not seeing him. 

He eventually got me to meet up with him for “closure” and I went because I felt bad as he’d paid so much to visit me and spent the time etc. On this evening I told him all the reasons we couldn’t work etc etc. I then told him to be honest with me and found out he’d been intimate with 3 other girls during the time we’d been talking. I told him this was the end and walked home. 

He now is still begging to see me and I know we can’t be together because too much has happened and there are now way too many issues to overcome but I can’t help thinking. AITA for now refusing to see him at all when he has come so far and spent so much money. Will I regret not seeing him?

UPDATE: 

It’s his last day today and I got a voice mail because I’ve stopped answering the no caller ID numbers.

I ended up losing a big part of my memory as a trauma response and didn’t remember most of what happened until I started therapy. I didn’t want to believe what happened and even tried to un-alive myself feeling as if it was my fault. unfortunately he’s the one who found me and had my mom take me to the hospital. I didn’t tell anyone until I was 16 nearly 17. I had told my aunt that I lived with at the time . She ended up telling my mother who confronted my brother about it. He admitted to everything on my 17th birthday and told my mom to tell me he wanted to talk and to tell me happy birthday. Fast forward to now I talked through it in therapy and have decided to set boundaries I asked my mom if she would no longer tell him about my life (she was telling him I was pregnant and that he had a nephew and sending pictures of us to the prison). Also told her that I don’t consider him a brother and want nothing to do with him. She told me that I need to get over it and learn to forgive. Saying “he came first and will always be first”. I talked to other family members, some in agreement with me and others siding with my mom. My grandma told me that it “happens to everyone” and that I’m “mean spirited and closed minded”. Not sure if should I just forgive him to make her happy or stand on my choice.
 
So am AITA?","Not only are you NTA, I would strongly encourage going LC or NC with your mom and other family members that are taking that same stance.",NTA,"What the actual F??  It happens to everyone?  Girl, you need to get the hell out of there, as in move away, block them, change all your contact info, tell them to forget you ever existed.  Totally nuclear scorched earth!  

That is ABSOLUTELY NOT NORMAL or ACCEPTABLE!  You have every right and reason to cut your brother off.   He actually hurt you bad enough to send you to the hospital multiple times - since you were 4??   Your mother had to know what was happening.  Did the doctor’s not call the authorities or anything? I cannot comprehend that happening - or anyone trying to defend him!

#ABSOLUTELY NTA!  NTA!  NTA!!",NTA,"I'm truly sorry for what you've experienced. It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted and hurt. Setting boundaries is a healthy response to protect yourself and your well-being. It's important to prioritize your healing and mental health over others' opinions, even family. Forgiveness is a personal journey and should never be forced upon you. It's okay to not forgive someone if it doesn't feel right for you. Your feelings are valid, and it's essential to honor them. The fact that some family members are supporting your choice indicates they recognize the seriousness of the situation. Healing from trauma is complex and takes time. It's crucial to surround yourself with supportive people who respect your boundaries and decisions. If maintaining distance is what you need for your peace and safety, then you're justified in doing so. Remember, you deserve to feel safe, respected, and heard. Continue working through this with your therapist, and trust in your own process. You're not alone in this.",NO_VERDICT,"I want to acknowledge the immense pain and trauma you've shared. You are absolutely NOT the asshole for setting boundaries and protecting yourself. What happened to you was serious abuse, and your feelings and reactions are completely valid.

It's deeply concerning that your mother and grandmother are minimizing this trauma and pressuring you to forgive. Sexual abuse is NOT something that ""happens to everyone"" and you have every right to maintain distance from your abuser, regardless of family ties.

The fact that you've worked through this in therapy and come to this decision shows tremendous strength. Setting boundaries isn't mean-spirited - it's essential for your wellbeing. You don't owe anyone forgiveness, especially not to make others comfortable.

Please continue working with your therapist and maintain whatever boundaries you need to feel safe. Consider connecting with sexual abuse survivor support groups who can better understand your experience. Your healing and safety come first, not others' expectations of forgiveness.",NTA,"You're not the one who should be apologizing or second-guessing your choices in this situation. Given the traumatic experiences you endured, especially at such a young age, it's understandable that you've chosen to distance yourself from your brother and set boundaries with your mom. Your decision to disown him and not forgive him right now might be a necessary step for your own healing and protection.

It's concerning that your mom and grandma are downplaying the severity of what happened to you and pressuring you to forgive so easily. Their reactions may be a reflection of their own struggles with dealing with the situation, but that doesn't mean you should compromise your own emotional well-being to make them happy. Remember that forgiveness is a personal choice, and it's not something that can be forced or expected from you, especially when it comes to such a traumatic experience.

You've already taken significant steps in seeking therapy and working through your feelings, and now it's essential to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. Stand by your decision and continue to advocate for yourself, even if it means facing opposition from family members.",NTA,"I hear how deeply hurt and betrayed you feel—being abused from such a young age and then having your mother dismiss the pain only added to the wound. It’s understandable that you’ve set hard boundaries and even declared you can’t forgive him; that is a protective stance, not a moral failing. Your mother’s insistence on “learning to forgive” is rooted in a different belief system, not the evidence of what happened. You’re not obligated to make her happy at the expense of your own healing. Consider a middle ground: keep the distance you need, but allow yourself to seek closure on your own terms—perhaps through continued therapy or a safe conversation with him, if ever you feel ready. Ultimately, your choice is yours, and it’s valid.",NO_VERDICT
