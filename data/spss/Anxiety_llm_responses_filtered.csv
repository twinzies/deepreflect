So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid."

I know there’s obvious things that call for going with your intuition, but people who don’t have anxiety don’t realize that we over analyze and fear most decisions. Even when we know what we want, we still fear being wrong. Anybody else? "

To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. Let's make today great!"

I drove for 40 minutes on the highway!! (which is really big for me since driving normally makes me SUPER anxious) and met up with her and we went out to get sushi! Although I stuttered a bit sometimes, I think things went really well and afterwards we ended up talking for like 4 hours in my car! She even agreed to a second date! This is the happiest I've been in a long time and I just wanted to share this with all you guys! Stay strong my dudes and have a great Memorial Day weekend!"

8r7ozl_249,8r7ozl,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again."

I see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and I get it, I'm in that boat too. So I want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.

If you leave your username I'll go through, when I'm bored, and send you a private message asking ""are you ok?""

You can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and I'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""Fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*""

Ok that is all :) 

Edit: Wow it went from 6 to 56 in an hour, I thought 30 would be a good number but this is also good. Thanks for all your kind words and to be honest I'm getting anxiety from just thinking about sending so many messages to random people but I promise I will get around to everyone by the end of the month. 

Edit 2: As suggested by a couple of people you can absolutely take note of a few users and send them a PM if you'd like. Me included. 

Edit 3: Oh crap, so long inbox, I barely got to know you. I'll just let this die down a bit before I start sending out more RU OK? PM's. But they will come, and when you least expect it, so don't wait on it. I'll be an RU OK? ninja. Striking when you least expect it. "

8xlqik_323,8xlqik,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! And that’s the best feeling in the entire world."

8z20x2_343,8z20x2,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?"

9a7dpv_394,9a7dpv,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I didn’t wanna go to this school party/dance event last night.. I don’t know anyone here. Even in high school and my hometown I never had any friends to talk to in person. For years I was alone and only had a few online friends.. 

I’m so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I’m just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It’s amazing and I had a great night. I’m so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. 


**Update:** **She just asked if I wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, I agreed. But I’m instantly regretting this. What have I done.**

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She’s really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You’re all amazing!**

**Update 3:** **I’m beginning to worry I’m gonna make them hate me. I feel like I’m so annoying.. I’ve never really had friends in person, other than online friends, and Ive been texting them a lot. They’ve been busy so we can’t talk in person. Has this happened to anyone else? Your mind and anxiety keeps telling you they’re gonna leave and forget you so you have to talk to them a lot and very often so you know they don’t hate you and you can have a little relief? What do I do?.. 


**Update 4 (probably last update):** They we’re just busy. We hung out last night and watched a movie and had fun. Already have plans for Labor Day weekend. I still can’t believe this is happening. This is the best hint that’s happened to me in 3 years. Thank you all so so much for the kind words. You’re all amazing people. "

I’m so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I’m just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It’s amazing and I had a great night. I’m so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. 


**Update:** **She just asked if I wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, I agreed. But I’m instantly regretting this. What have I done.**

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She’s really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You’re all amazing!**

I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  My anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that I actually have a full time job, 2) that I'll be doing what I love, and 3) It's less than 15 minutes from my new home.

What will I be doing, you ask?  Working with DOGS!  I love, Love, LOVE dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  I'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (I love giving them baths!).

I feel the complete *opposite* of what I felt going into that second interview at last week.  In every way.  I'm confident, too...  That's rare for me.  Thanks, anxiety.  Seriously, though...

9ecvfp_421,9ecvfp,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ "

Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down.

a0k03f_617,a0k03f,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!"

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

These struggles are so rough and facing it everyday is really something.  But; struggling does not negate your strength.  We are infinite wells of resilience because we have to be, we all deserve love and kindness and warmth every single day.  ❤️❤️

Anorexia Nervosa
PTSD from childhood emotional/physical abuse 
PTSD from being raped when I was 17
PTSD from the illness and death of my mom at the age of 12 

I’ve been unemployed for 6 months and my last job was in a RAMPANT environment of sexual harassment it was disgusting.

I just feel so embarassed and ashamed of myself.

Of course Im sure everyone does something cringey once in a while... Im just worrying way to much. 

Thanks for reading

Edit: thank you all for your wonderful advice. Happy holidays and have a great day!"

acpyz0_789,acpyz0,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone! "

Like I’ve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I’m almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people! And though I’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way I do- I feel a bit more fortified that I’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. Let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! 

We got this!"

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I’m almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people! And though I’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way I do- I feel a bit more fortified that I’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. Let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! 

We got this!"

I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

amqy1o_918,amqy1o,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know I’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha.

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. "

I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha.

Last year I lost my job (lost as in I had no choice but to leave due to my mental health) and went spiralling down, living off my savings which weren’t a lot at all.

Now, I can proudly say I turned up for an interview shaken and paranoid to be working there today and it feels great to be distracted. I can be on my own, I don’t have to talk to people all day and it’s laid back; perfect for myself.

I am extremely proud of myself, although I still have a lot of issues with my mental health I need to address, small steps like this really help everything else.

She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and binge eating disorder. I can't help it sometimes and when I talk to someone about it, they brush it off like it's not a big deal because I can't figure out why I'm anxious. 

I woke up wanting to eat my whole fridge today. Is there really a giant reason? No. People say ""just eat then"". They don't understand that if I do right now, idk if I can stop myself. You know? It goes with OCD too. You can't stop thinking about it until you act on the obsession.

azrmao_1036,azrmao,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

Edit 2: Wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. I've read all of them and I am speechless. Also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, I appreciate it very much. I don't really know what to say, this community is so kind. Thank you "

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I’m doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks."

b25lyk_1049,b25lyk,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ❤️"

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ❤️"
b2b1t3_1056,b2b1t3,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure. Do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?"

I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

Please, if you are suffering and drinking, give it a try. You have nothing to lose. I am going on a retreat tomorrow and I'll be on a flight for a bit, but I'll answer any questions and reply to all comments."

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it.

I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?"

I’m new here and I guess I just hope I’m not the only one that deals with this. I’m diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I’ve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I’ve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?"

I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?"

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn’t so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn’t just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like “oh maybe everyone did well” or “maybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.” I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I’ll catch myself saying things like “why is your heart beating so fast, my god you’re just getting on the bus, it’s not a big deal.” 

Anyone else? I’m curious!

Edit: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments everyone!!! I really thought the irritability and negativity was uncommon with anxiety, it’s so comforting to know it’s not. Thanks for sharing your experiences with me, it helps me more than anyone will know."

- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down.

I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits."

People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits."

I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better."

c5uovo_1446,c5uovo,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

edit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it’s so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) I will update once I hear back about the job."

Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

edit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it’s so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) I will update once I hear back about the job."

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I’M JUST SO EXCITED!!!!

Edit: I promise I’m done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I’m over the moon, I can’t believe I’m me and I did this haha.

I really did not like the job I quit and was stressed and unhappy all the time and job hunting for nearly the whole time I was there.

Now the new job is causing me that same tick tick stress and dislike that I can’t compartmentalize and I feel like maybe the whole change was for nothing.

cc7boe_1513,cc7boe,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program"

I have extremely bad driving anxiety and I have been stressing about this trip for months and today was the day. I drove 2 hours ON THE HIGHWAY!!!! I WENT LIKE 100 km/hr!!!!! and then 2 hours back (in the dark!!!) !!!!!!!

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it"

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved."

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Then I get anxiety. I get defensive at times too. Sometimes I get close to deleting the post because I don't like people disrespecting me when I know damn well I don't deserve it"

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you’ll be fine about a certain situation

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about! 

I just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won’t know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!"

I just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won’t know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!"

The other day I just thought fuck it I’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere I can feel more happy and fulfilled.

Still not out of the woods yet but I’m trying given the terrible circumstances.

Of course I am anxious and scared still of the uncertainty, I hear the horrible voice saying ‘everything will fail’ ‘nothing will work out for you’

London will be a fresh start for me, whilst I’m at it I might even change my name and identity lol"

Thanks everyone for the support, I had a fun night and didn't have any anxiety at all, it was uncharted territory for me because I moved to this city about 3 weeks ago and I don't know anyone who lives close to me. Seeing all the replies telling me to have fun definitely made it much more fun too because, I accept that I'm a bit of a attention whore. Thanks again everyone, I love this subreddit."

I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can’t afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can’t afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won’t allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. Staying up late is as close as it gets. The rest of the world is asleep and I can think in peace. As soon as I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and it will be time to move through the motions again and scramble to pull myself together. Yes, this is a rant but the question is not rhetorical. Feel free to respond if you relate. This is my first post here (hi)

Edit: I didn’t expect this much support! Thank you! Update: I got one of my assignments done and finished the paperwork for my new job today and I’m feeling good about it! I’ve been brainstorming ways to make my current living situation more bearable, and am aiming to visit my dad over spring break in March. I’m doing my best to stay positive and not dwell on too many negative “what ifs” in regards to his condition. Just trying to focus on one or 2 things at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed or spiraling out. I really do appreciate all of your kind words!"

dyfwbm_2076,dyfwbm,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best."

dyfwbm_2079,dyfwbm,llama,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over.

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think.

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general."
edx16n_2169,edx16n,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain &lt;3

It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either.

No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave.

ej29di_2218,ej29di,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say.

ej29di_2219,ej29di,gpt-4o,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
&gt;""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn’t even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn’t be more proud right now. I’m IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

“does she actually give a shit about this?”

“you look stupid just stop”

the usual. 

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys."

English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

etuxsn_2346,etuxsn,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I've suffered from a severe panic and anxiety disorder since i was 11. I'm 21 now, still suffering but going to a clinic soon to fix it. My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what? It worked!! I survived the panic attack, i pulled through it and it feels f*cking amazing!! It gave me new hope and i actually believe that i'm able to overcome it. If you read everything, thank you! I just wanted to share my little victory with you :)"

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!"

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!"

Partly because I totaled my car and can’t really go anywhere currently/not much to do in my town that’s walkable and partly because I use social media a lot to find things I need.  Like currently:

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that’s how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don’t want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it’s not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it’s ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON’T indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don’t know why I’m posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don’t talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I’m just in a super weird head space right now and I don’t feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can’t even tell if it’s all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn’t even exist still. Simpler times. I don’t know what I need but all I know is I feel like I’m annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it’s all just stupid anxiety.

I’m so over it. So much.

fbq6n2_2509,fbq6n2,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that’s my problem?"

fbq6n2_2511,fbq6n2,gpt-oss,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

No one gives a shit how you do things. So do it anyway without thinking anything.
Just go on and don't think... You can achieve everything you ever wanted.
Just believe yourself.

Lately at times I've felt a lack of empathy and alot of anxiety, but when I saw him I thought of how small he is and how I cant wait to be a dad. And I had a ton of anxiety regarding whether I set up his safe room well and if I would do something wrong and all that. All is going well so far, but just sitting here with him seeing how beautiful he is, and releazing how much I really do love him, I've just been crying my eyes out. Idk if this is weird or not.

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone &gt;&lt; Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here"

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  

Appreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.  I got lucky because I have a very stable job and its just my husband and I at home."

It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?"

g4y8e7_2801,g4y8e7,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,"I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?"

Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?"

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words.

gg45u4_2895,gg45u4,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks.

gmezo7_2957,gmezo7,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It’s so wonderfully comforting to know that I’m not the only one going through this."

Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others”

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come."

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.

I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh."

It's like the world is trying to devour me

I just want this to stop but it always comes back, always 

I know its such self pitying bullshit but I cannot convince myself that anyone really likes me, no matter what they say, being alive is just so tiring 

I treat EVERYTHING like a freaking personal attack 
I twist every postive, kind thing the people in my life do for me and turn it into something absolutely unrecognizable

Its disgusting

I cannot make a right decision 

Posting this is wrong 

But I dont know what else to do?

But its wrong 

Writing this out has kind of been therapeutic so there's that? 

Its either I write this freakout to reddit because all other social media is terrifying rn (and people i know inhabit those, ew) or I keep scrolling through the apps on my phone endlessly while I hyperventilate 

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.
Thank you for reading.
Any helpful tips to deal would be appreciated.
I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

I hate when people don’t wear masks and completely ignore all social distancing I’m trying to practice. Don’t get close to me!!!! Is that so freaking hard! Don’t get close. Note I’m wearing a mask and staring at you getting closer like please stop!!!  Ugh. My bf is back at work (in retail) and these customers coming in for unnecessary BS is really setting off my anxiety. I’m trying to pick him up rn and I heard some guy on his way out complaining about how they’re closing early and all employees wear masks. Like wtf dude YOU could potentially die from this. Stop going out for random crap you CAN go without! Is it just lack of will power or do you really think this is all a hoax? Whatever. We’ll all have to go back on lockdown soon anyway bc our numbers are rising.

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

You’re inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don’t hit someone. I hate when people tailgate me when I’m at the speed limit or slightly above. When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I’m terrified they’ll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake.

Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fiancé. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep. I told her my cat told me he was able to go now because he knew someone was there to take over for him in watching over me."

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i’m doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!"

homwjx_3321,homwjx,claude,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

hpaekj_3328,hpaekj,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"When it rains (as it is doing so now), I always love to turn off my lights and lie in bed listening to it hit the roof or pavement outside. I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

Kinda breaks my heart... but at least I have the memories. And the falling rain reminds me of those wonderful memories. But the sound too is just so relaxing and soothing."

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx"

I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.)

I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I’ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

I just want to take a moment to thank everyone who has taken the time to share such love in this thread. Thank you so much. I am often hesitant to write my feelings out for fear of being judged but I have learned that it also helps me heal.  Thank you again, you and you're family stay healthy."

The schedule for next week came out today and I was super excited because I had two days off in a row and my mental health hasn't been the greatest lately so I was super excited. But then my mom spoke for me (she works at the same place I do) and said I wanted another day for more hours so I was scheduled another day and only had one day off. I was so upset so I went to talk to the person that makes the schedules and I was honest with her. I said that my mental health hasn't been great and that I would like to have the two days in a row. She was so nice about it and just gave the shift to someone else and I'm so proud of myself!

It took a year to find a therapist who’s available to see me. And we met...sort of. The connection on their end was so bad I couldn’t hear a word they were saying. So the whole 60 minutes was spent saying: “what? Can you repeat that?” *garbled unintelligible speech* “I’m sorry I missed it again could you say it again” ect ect.

ia7nas_3585,ia7nas,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels &amp; frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time &amp; we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)"

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. 😀

When I got out of college I was broke and didn't have insurance, so I stopped going to the dentist. After a while I finally got a decent job and dental insurance, but my anxiety had become worse and my shame/avoidance behaviors kicked in. The more time that passed, the more shame I felt about not having been to the dentist. So I just didn't go. 

I don't know what changed recently, but the other day I just looked up a place with good reviews and made an appointment before I could think about it too much. I told them it had been a few years so I didn't have any x-rays to send over. Nobody made a big deal about it. The dental hygenist and the dentist were both very kind. Also, apparently these days they let you watch Netflix while your teeth are being cleaned?? Back in my day your only entertainment was the sound of metal scraping against tooth enamel. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. None of my friends know about this because I'm too embarrassed to admit to it, but I'm very proud of myself.

ie3uac_3627,ie3uac,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it.

I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on. Thank you to each and every one of you."

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be."

I mention my social anxiety and how it prevents me from leaving my comfort zone and meeting new people. Trust me, I have been working on it. 

Someone has the audacity to comment and tell me to “get over it” because I’m in college now. I can’t tell you how much that pissed me off. 

Okay, miss rising high school junior, why don’t you take my social anxiety and depression with you? See how it feels and how difficult it is to simply “get over it”. Social anxiety is a real mental health issue. Jesus Christ, you think being one of those “chance me for college admissions, I take my studies seriously” people would actually have a brain cell and some empathy. 

People don’t take mental health seriously. This really infuriates me."

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn’t think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn’t see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn’t right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It’s so fucked up. I can’t describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn’t see my partner anymore. I didn’t have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don’t know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren’t the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I’ve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was. 

Thank you for reading.

Thanks for the award u/LikeFry-LikeFry!

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was. 

Thank you for reading.

Thanks for the award u/LikeFry-LikeFry!

Final Edit: Thank you everyone who keeps giving me these awards! Its motivated me to want to keep going to work!

j61jth_3992,j61jth,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

Pass it on."
j61jth_3993,j61jth,gpt-4o,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

I actually got a job. I did applications, I did interviews, and I didn’t have a panic meltdown ONCE. I actually impressed people. I actually got MY FIRST JOB. 

It’s a data entry clerk position and I can work remotely and there’s minimal social interaction besides the people on my team.

I never thought I’d be able to do this honestly. I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job. 

I even opened up a bank account today for myself. 

Sure, I’m anxious about starting work and worried I’m gonna be bad at it..but that’s a problem for me later. Right now im thrilled I even did it. It can get better y’all.

I told him everything, and went through some questionnaires with him.  He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal."" 

I feel really discouraged.

Edit: Thank you for the perspective, advice, and support. I think that those of you who suggested that the doctor is just starting at the bottom of the treatment ladder are correct. I have otherwise had good experiences with this doctor, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I do think however that he could have done better than just suggest I use a different app to do something I already indicated wasn't working. It felt really dismissive, and sent me down a bit of a spiral. I will try again (although I already worry I'll just fail at it and it will be one more failure for the books), and I'll work on my sleep hygiene myself. Again, thank you for the support."

He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal."" 

I feel really discouraged.

Edit: Thank you for the perspective, advice, and support. I think that those of you who suggested that the doctor is just starting at the bottom of the treatment ladder are correct. I have otherwise had good experiences with this doctor, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I do think however that he could have done better than just suggest I use a different app to do something I already indicated wasn't working. It felt really dismissive, and sent me down a bit of a spiral. I will try again (although I already worry I'll just fail at it and it will be one more failure for the books), and I'll work on my sleep hygiene myself. Again, thank you for the support."

I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

UPDATE: I texted her some, but she seldom replied, and even when she did, she didn't very interested. I don't think anything will come out of this, but this was a huge milestone for me and I'm proud of myself nonetheless!"

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I’m just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

jn9o4i_4199,jn9o4i,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"Yesterday evening my city was hit by a terrible terrorist attack. Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside. 

Whoever read this far, thank you. I don't even know why I wrote this. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it somehow."

(Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)"

js3qdw_4266,js3qdw,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"The amounts of hatred I have towards school is immesurable. IT made me into what I am. IT gave me HUGE amounts of COMPLETELY UNECESSARY anxiety and depression. IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

PS: School and the education system can go burn in hell. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT OF THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO????? WE AREN'T SOME FUCKING RATS IN A LAB THAT YOU POKE AT. Im so frustrated....

EDIT: 

**OH  MY GOD! Thank you so much for the support, people. I just wanted to  vent out my feelings because they have been bottled up for years. I am  aware that a lot of you are asking me a lot of questions but i can't  asnwer everything. So here are some stuff i can say:**

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**
2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**
3. **Despite  a minority of people disagreeing with me and calling me overdramatic, i  would just want to point out that i am venting and not stating  anything.**

**THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT MEANS A LOT FOR ME! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3**"

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

PS: School and the education system can go burn in hell. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT OF THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO????? WE AREN'T SOME FUCKING RATS IN A LAB THAT YOU POKE AT. Im so frustrated....

**OH  MY GOD! Thank you so much for the support, people. I just wanted to  vent out my feelings because they have been bottled up for years. I am  aware that a lot of you are asking me a lot of questions but i can't  asnwer everything. So here are some stuff i can say:**

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**
2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**
3. **Despite  a minority of people disagreeing with me and calling me overdramatic, i  would just want to point out that i am venting and not stating  anything.**

**THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT MEANS A LOT FOR ME! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3**"

IT gave me HUGE amounts of COMPLETELY UNECESSARY anxiety and depression. IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all.

It’s the busiest season for my niche-insurance market and I’m tired from working 45-50hr work weeks. My anxiety keeps me from taking off work knowing I’ll feel guilty for not helping the company when they need me the most. 

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for “outstanding attendance” which quickly made me realize I’m the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break. 

Anyways I took the day off to let someone else get that recognition for this month."

Normally I would have stressed over it for days, getting super anxious about the idea of knocking on a strangers door (we just moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and haven’t met many neighbors), and eventually get so anxious about how long it’s been that I just never even get the package at all. But today I just took a deep breath, went over to the neighbors house, and knocked on their door. He answered right away and was very nice and gave me my package! And, bonus- now I know one more neighbor. 

Anyways this sounds like a silly win, but for me it feels like big progress. I’m proud of myself today

jzw1t3_4368,jzw1t3,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"No matter what I do, I always feel sick to my stomach anxious knowing I gotta go to work the next morning. 

Fast forward to the next morning, I’m still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don’t smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It’s crappy, but true. 

Thank you for listening to my story and replying and liking it even. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, I’m always here to talk!"

The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.


I just want a break man, I‘m tired of feeling like dying over things that have many solutions to it.


Generalized anxiety is a bitch"

When your anxious, your mind thinks the worst possible scenario, not the most REALISTIC scenario. The worst possible scenario could have a &lt;1% chance of being true but it doesn’t feel like that in the state of anxiousness.

It’s a trap, it feels like you’re gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you’re stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Again, you’re thinking about the most unlikely, worst case scenario. No, you’re not going to go crazy, you aren’t gonna have a heart attack, your life isn’t ruined forever, you’re intrusive thoughts won’t clog your mind forever.

This chest tightness, cloudy brain feeling won’t last forever, but it doesn’t go away by itself, you gotta put in the effort. Hope this helps!"

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression.

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression.

kduds3_4558,kduds3,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So I have been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I started college this past fall. I saw a counselor there who was marginally helpful but my anxiety just seemed to get worse, and after talking to some friends with similar issues I thought it might be good to try medication for it as well as therapy. I'm on break now and I decided to start seeing a therapist back home who my parents recommended to me. I told her about my anxiety and how it was affecting my ability to do schoolwork and how I'm terrified of driving so I still only have a permit at the age of 19, and how I'm really afraid of phone calls. She straight up told me that I am only acting like this ""because I like the attention"". That really bothered  me because I really want to be independent and I feel really guilty for inconveniencing other people, and I always feel guilty about having panic attacks because I know my friends and family are going to worry about me. But I could be trying to minimize my faults to make myself feel better...I don't know what to believe. Is it reasonable to get upset over this? Is she actually right and I just need to listen to her? I'm set to see a psychiatrist this week to hopefully start anxiety medication soon and that will probably help but rn I just feel like a useless deluded crazy person."

It’s incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I’m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

I feel so loved by my thoughtful sons."

Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I’m truly touched by everyone’s suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I’ve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I’ll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this."

Does anyone else experience very heightened anxiety at night? If so, what remedies have you found that worked to get you sleeping through the night? Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: 
Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I’m truly touched by everyone’s suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I’ve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I’ll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this."

It has ruined my mood the whole weekend, I feel so nervous and down and on edge. 

I just want to call in sick forever and hide in bed...

😓 

I hate lying in bed at night wide awake worrying about the morning... I hate the feeling of worrying about not sleeping and it making the situation worse. 

Has anyone found a way to combat sinday blues / work anxiety after time off? 

Sending love to everyone else facing Monday...

*Edit: thank you everyone for your kind messages and replies. I love the phrase ""Sunday Scaries"", I'll be using that! 

I survived the night (barely)... horrible nights sleep. 

I think I will start trying meditation. Even though I am on medication that helps my anxiety,I have so much trouble switching my brain off at night. 

We can do it! 💙"

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards. Replying will take time. Y'all know how it goes - up and down, excited, scared, happy, sad, the full range in an hour!"

I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do."

I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do."

I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

It affects me so much in my life when sometimes it’s not even worth it, it’s just me entertaining a unrealistic thought. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I go to sleep I am talking to myself in my brain mostly it speaks negatively it makes me overthink everything I do. I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won’t let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It’s all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it’s not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn’t say I’m depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I’m starting to see maybe it’s anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I’m so tired of it effecting my everyday life. If you have any tips for making your mind not be so loud and controlling please leave comment I am so tired of letting myself bring myself down every single day."

she did have anxiety &amp; depression, so i’m totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i’ve been envious of others before &amp; i’ve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn’t make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia &amp; depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn’t leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i’m not a very open person &amp; prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with “oh well you should live a day in my life” or “oh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.” i’m obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered &amp; she would respond with “ya well my family has been murdered twenty times.” 

it doesn’t matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn’t matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people’s problems. that contributes to why i don’t open up. i’m always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven’t showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can’t bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don’t want to have a future &amp; i don’t feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren’t working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don’t believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can’t look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i’m scared that they’ll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren’t valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don’t compare other people’s problems to theirs. don’t minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. 🌻🖤🌼"

she did have anxiety &amp; depression, so i’m totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i’ve been envious of others before &amp; i’ve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn’t make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia &amp; depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn’t leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i’m not a very open person &amp; prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with “oh well you should live a day in my life” or “oh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.” i’m obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered &amp; she would respond with “ya well my family has been murdered twenty times.” 

it doesn’t matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn’t matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people’s problems. that contributes to why i don’t open up. i’m always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven’t showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can’t bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don’t want to have a future &amp; i don’t feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren’t working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don’t believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can’t look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i’m scared that they’ll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren’t valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don’t compare other people’s problems to theirs. don’t minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. 🌻🖤🌼"

I was very anxious and stressed, eating poorly and very little even sometimes just once a day. My nights were very particular, sometimes sleeping less than 4 hours a day every day.

Today concludes the second week in which I sleep early and wake up comfortably. Besides complying with 5 meals a day, especially breakfast which I missed SO MUCH.
I went back to exercising, playing the guitar, playing chess online.

I still have a lot to do, and although the current situation is not the best I can say that I am ready to go back to work with a positive mindset!"

I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (&lt;3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships.

Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets."

I frequently think I’d like to do one of these but get anxious about it so I don’t and just end up on my phone on Reddit (naturally) or watching shows I’ve seen a million times. I think the anxiety might be associated with the distraction or the emotions felt when I do these things - but I feel like a freak who can’t watch TV shows that everyone else watches and enjoys. Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me??

Edit: thank you everyone for responding below - I honestly really felt like I was the only one in the world who felt this way. Thank you for helping me feel like I’m not alone in this!"

lo5uv7_5035,lo5uv7,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn’t get out of bed. But also couldn’t sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn’t. I couldn’t eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It’s like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. No chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic. 

All I want is to punch my anxiety in the face and yell “can we at least talk about this?”"

Having my ringer off makes me even more anxious because I don't know when someone has texted or called. Especially when texting my SO. There's no reason to have anxiety texting him but I always do. I am not even worried for a reason and yet my hands shake so much I can barely type.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself. I used to miss school because I would get so sick from anxiety in the morning. Does anyone else have their anxiety give them an upset stomach?"

lpa08i_5048,lpa08i,claude,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength."

I think I spend more time in my one head than in the real life. I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows.

Don’t get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn’t. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but I’m almost 22 years old now… and I don’t know if this is still a good thing.

I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao"

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao"

I'm sick of being alone, I'm sick of having no one. Having said that, I know it's my own fault. After the abuse I suffered I closed off, and closed everyone else out. I've been lonely, and have suffered alone for 10 years now.

I now realize that all people aren't out to get me, that life without people to share it with is pointless. So now I pray. I pray that the world that I closed off would take me back.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*"

I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*"

I also have bad health anxiety so maybe focusing on it has been making me feel weird. I’m not sure.

I contacted my doctor cause the heart palpitations and the need for breathing exercises usually happen at night.  
But I have to wait two weeks to have a 10 min phone call with my doctor.

Edit #2: do you guys in the replies think maybe you’re being is sensitive than others? I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I’m grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people’s energy.

mrc66q_5345,mrc66q,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I’m still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I’ve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, “oh god, you’re bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.” I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a “shout out” because I handled the tough questions “like a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.” She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was “one of the best” he’d seen and he’d found it “extremely useful and insightful”. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else’s. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

UPDATE: Oh my gosh thank you so much for all the fantastically kind comments and for the awards! I honestly expected maybe 5 people to be interested in this! I’m glad my experience has resonated with so many people and I really hope it can be an encouraging little story to anyone who is battling with anxiety. I hope it shows anyone who reads it that anxiety isn’t always reflective of reality. 
It’s great hearing about everyone else’s takes on anxiety and perception. What a fantastic community! Thank you everyone for your support! I hope you are all having a great day. :)"

mrovy7_5352,mrovy7,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Everything is stressful and anxiety-inducing. Every. Thing. I barely leave my apartment anymore. My car needs an oil change that I’m too scared to go get done. I don’t make or answer phone calls. I have zero friends. I don’t. Do. Anything. I literally just sit at home watching Netflix to pass time. I lost my job last year and was on unemployment for awhile. Now I’m thirty pounds fatter and am rapidly running out of money because I waste it all on junk food because that’s the only source of comfort I have. Now I’m job searching but I’m too scared to do interviews and even if I did get one I know I have to go out and buy all new clothes and the idea of doing that just makes me want to die. 

Just. Every aspect of life is so hard and embarrassing and stressful. I never feel happy or content. Even shut up in my apartment I’m just thinking about how pathetic I am and how I’m wasting my life but I can’t change it. People always say to get therapy but how am I supposed to do that when I can’t even make a phone call or walk out my front door? How am I supposed to sit in a room with someone and be the center of attention and talk about my deepest thoughts and feelings? Like my anxiety is literally preventing me from getting help for anxiety...

I wrote this all in like two minutes and I’m not proofreading it so sorry if it doesn’t make sense. I just needed to get it out I guess."

Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!"

I am 24 years old and have put off driving for a long time because it gave me so much anxiety to think about being in control of a vehicle on the road. I have been practicing  (and crying ngl lol) for almost an entire year and honestly felt pretty hopeless after the first two tests. I was so anxious during the exams!! Literally hands shaking and at moments felt like I wasn’t “real” and that horrible sunken feeling in my stomach whenever I get anxious about anything. 
 

But i did it!!! If I can do it so can you!!! I see you, and I know you’re doing your best :) you will get it! 

Random but interesting note: when I pulled into the DMV parking lot “drivers license” by olivia rodrigo started playing on the radio 

HAPPY 420 !!"

I have spent an hour preparing. I have done breathing exercises to calm myself down and not cry. I prepared my bed for the ease of running away and hiding in it as soon as the phone call is done.

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

And then they just... don't pick up.

And now almost a year later, its still there, intrusive thoughts, always overthinking. Honestly for the last year, i don't think there was a single time I was truly at peace, just sitting on the couch and relaxing. Its literally either me being anxious/depressed or me doing my best to distract myself from my thoughts.

And i've just realized how much time i've wasted. I look back this past year. and i dont think about memories i've made, fun i've had, or accomplishments, its just my anxiety taking up all my mental space. And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&amp;#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers"

There are times where I will just say “why” but I know full well why, just so I can avoid offering anything else on the topic.

n1smxe_5461,n1smxe,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?"

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!"

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference"

Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference"

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful.

n8c6tk_5517,n8c6tk,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Anxiety is a mental behavior. Often a worrying about the future, solving problems, ruminating about the past, overly caring what others think about you, hyper analyzing your own words or actions, etc..

And when these patterns and behaviors are noticed they are often excited by another behavior: us resisting them, or trying to hide them.

Ive found it incredibally effective to name these behaviors as if they were characters in your head, And when they appear, simply say hello to them. Maybe thank them for trying to keep you safe, and thats it. In time, they will relax, but this cant be your goal. Acceptance of them must be your goal.

Here are some of my characters:
""The reherses future conversations guy""

""The replays past social interactions guy""

""The finds reasons to avoid things guy""

""The narrator""

""The overanalyzing my owns words as i speak guy""

""The worried that future events wont happen the way I want them to guy""

""The trying to stop current behavior guy""

""The angry i was treated unfairly guy""

And i even visualize what they look like, sometimes draw them on paper. Give them a real voice and and real nod of ackowledgement, and you detach yourself from them. They eventually lose power over you.

I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again.... 

How are you guys handling going back to some form of ""normal"" or ""before""?"

My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a ""let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe"" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return.

I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I’m a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine."

o5pzin_5744,o5pzin,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I know there’s no way to not sound like a prude by saying this. Look, I don’t care if you use weed. If it helps you, that’s great. It helps with your anxiety? Great.

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I’m already taking. I don’t want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that’s being sold on the street to get high. I’ve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don’t* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It’s just that it’s the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So… weed. Sure, it’s “more harmless” than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance — like medication, alcohol, food — can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don’t care if it’s fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It’s always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don’t want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I’m told it’s not “that bad”. Hell, I don’t want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me. 

Like I’ve said above, I know people generally mean well. But it starts getting annoying when they keep pushing for me to take weed, like it’s a panacea for my illnesses. I want to tell them: I’m glad it helps you, I am, but just because it works for you doesn’t mean it will work for me.

o5pzin_5745,o5pzin,gpt-4o,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I know there’s no way to not sound like a prude by saying this. Look, I don’t care if you use weed. If it helps you, that’s great. It helps with your anxiety? Great.

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I’m already taking. I don’t want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that’s being sold on the street to get high. I’ve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don’t* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It’s just that it’s the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So… weed. Sure, it’s “more harmless” than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance — like medication, alcohol, food — can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don’t care if it’s fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It’s always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don’t want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I’m told it’s not “that bad”. Hell, I don’t want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me. 

Like I’ve said above, I know people generally mean well. But it starts getting annoying when they keep pushing for me to take weed, like it’s a panacea for my illnesses. I want to tell them: I’m glad it helps you, I am, but just because it works for you doesn’t mean it will work for me.

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

I feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success."

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace."

When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors."

I decided to turn around but instead of taking my normal way I decided to take a shortcut that I have never taken before. I was flagged down by a man who said there was a guy “sleeping or drunk” on the side of the road and asked me to see if I could wake him up. (The man that flagged me down couldn’t speak good English and it was a busy road). I got out of my car and went over to the man. He was “snoring” but I knew that he wasn’t drunk he was actually overdosing. I asked how long he had been there and the man said over 30 minutes. I grabbed the phone and called the police. I told them someone was on the side of the road with visible powder up their nose and puke all over them. The operator instructed me to try to wake him up. I found a landscaper and ripped the gloves off of him and proceeded to try and wake the man up. The snoring was getting louder, I was told to start CPR. The guy was stuck behind a tree and I couldn’t move him I’m very weak  and he was at least 200 pounds. I tried my best to drag him out. He stopped breathing and I realized he was choking on his own vomit. I pushed him onto his side and he began breathing again. The police showed up and he woke up after some help from them. 

My father is a recovering drug addict and this was one of the worst moments of my life. I can’t stop thinking about it. I have no medical training, I didn’t know what to do. I can’t believe no one helped me, people were just watching. They left him there for over 30 minutes. It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Has anyone ever dealt with helping a stranger like this? I can’t stop replaying the images in my head. I get the worst anxiety about this. Is it stupid if I reach out to a therapist?"

I was flagged down by a man who said there was a guy “sleeping or drunk” on the side of the road and asked me to see if I could wake him up. (The man that flagged me down couldn’t speak good English and it was a busy road). I got out of my car and went over to the man. He was “snoring” but I knew that he wasn’t drunk he was actually overdosing. I asked how long he had been there and the man said over 30 minutes. I grabbed the phone and called the police. I told them someone was on the side of the road with visible powder up their nose and puke all over them. The operator instructed me to try to wake him up. I found a landscaper and ripped the gloves off of him and proceeded to try and wake the man up. The snoring was getting louder, I was told to start CPR. The guy was stuck behind a tree and I couldn’t move him I’m very weak  and he was at least 200 pounds. I tried my best to drag him out. He stopped breathing and I realized he was choking on his own vomit. I pushed him onto his side and he began breathing again. The police showed up and he woke up after some help from them. 

My father is a recovering drug addict and this was one of the worst moments of my life. I can’t stop thinking about it. I have no medical training, I didn’t know what to do. I can’t believe no one helped me, people were just watching. They left him there for over 30 minutes. It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Has anyone ever dealt with helping a stranger like this? I can’t stop replaying the images in my head. I get the worst anxiety about this. Is it stupid if I reach out to a therapist?"

owodyh_5893,owodyh,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day."

The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future."

I struggled with the idea of taking it because all the possible side effects had my hypochondriac mind on edge but when my dad asked me if I wanted to get it today I said yes on the spur of the moment, and then followed through.
I feel fine at the moment.
The only downside is that the side effects I have to look out for are almost exactly the same as manifestations of my anxiety, but I'm a little too relieved to think about it right now.

I struggled with the idea of taking it because all the possible side effects had my hypochondriac mind on edge but when my dad asked me if I wanted to get it today I said yes on the spur of the moment, and then followed through.
I feel fine at the moment.
The only downside is that the side effects I have to look out for are almost exactly the same as manifestations of my anxiety, but I'm a little too relieved to think about it right now.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

All wounds will heal with time but it sucks we have to go through this terrifying traumatic experience."

The fact we have people actively prolonging this pandemic makes me feel even shittier. Vaccinated or not I have to treat and have contact with sick people. I just found out i have covid (again) and it’s really bothersome. I’m vaccinated so my symptoms aren’t terrible but I still feel shitty. And even with a positive test because we are so understaffed my superiors still want me to go in and just avoid contact with patients. How is this okay? What is this coming to? I wanna get out of this place.

q2emiu_6040,q2emiu,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"You aren’t dying. You don’t have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn’t been seen in decades. You aren’t going insane. You don’t have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it’s a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you."

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time."

I also graduated college class of 2020 and spent my graduating sitting on my couch crying because I was so sad. I decided to try to let it go, since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn’t. Now, it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I’m happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn’t been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can’t even do that, and I don’t want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven’t been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don’t know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there’s nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it’s causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Edit: I am blown away by the kindness of strangers who don’t even know me, but took the time to write something nice. Sending all of you virtual hugs❤️ I am so appreciative of all your kind words

On every break I had to go to the toilet (nausea, sorry if that's gross :/). I finished school- went to the shop with my mum. My heart was still beating very heavily and I felt dizzy. Additionally I got lost without a phone. The shop was huge and I was looking on the right and then to the left trying to spot my mom in the huge crowd of people. With every move of my head I felt more and more dizzy. I thought I was gonna either burst out crying or pass out. I didn't luckily. Just imagine, 17 years old man crying because he got lost in the shop- pathetic, but I was in such a bad state this day that it was really hard to keep myself at least a little bit rational. Well, I found her (yay :,)) I got back home but I am in such a bad state that I am not able to eat anything. I've tried but I feel like throwing up and my heart is still so loud. What shall I do?

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

Edit: I am overwhelmed by the support I've seen in this post. Thank you all for your comments and PMs. The rewards were also lovely. 

Your comments have helped me more then you know. Thank you for your support!"

tjg8w0_6344,tjg8w0,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"A coping mechanism I have is that I’ll sort of get through the hours of the day until it is nighttime and I know I can have the sweet release of sleep soon. Of course this isn’t every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it’s the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don’t mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day. I still have plenty of days where I am enjoying the things through the day, but even on those days when 5 hours fly by I’m like “oh bonus I’m closer to bed”.

Some days it’s like my only hope though where I am really all over the place and it’s my anchor to keep going. Idk, I’m sure it sounds bad that I “look forward to going to sleep everyday” but I find it a pretty good coping mechanism."

I realize it is possible to be normal but I'm gonna have to do this everyday to conquer my fears. I even managed to pick up a few things in the grocery store. I felt awkward and got anxious when I was at the cash register but I made it through. I'm just proud I was able to leave my house even if I was anxious the entire time. the things normal people take for granted like being in public is a luxury feeling for people with anxiety...

I'm SO proud of myself! I've had debilitating anxiety, depression, and ADHD for years so believe me when I tell you that anything is possible!!!!"

It’s hard to find motivation especially when the anxiety is really bad. So do something you enjoy first. Like self care. My self care today is ice cream and going to a park and reading a book. Yay for getting dressed and getting out of the house despite dreading it. It wasn’t so bad and now I will do dishes, pat myself on the back, and call it a productive day so I can go binge watch a show. What do you guys do for self care or to get yourself moving on harder days? I’d love to hear about it. Sending good vibes!

wrus19_6541,wrus19,claude,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Last Monday I walked in on my wife taking an excessive amount of very dangerous heart pills. And somehow I was too stupid to realize she wasn’t joking, she wanted to die. Luckily she was talking to her therapist who made her a Safety plan that I thought was a great idea. I got rid of all the guns in the house, all the pills and all was well. About 4 days later she admitted she had picked a day, a time, and how she was going to do it. Which was yesterday at 9 in the morning with about 150 pills she had hid from me. A few phone calls later she was whisked away to a crisis center. 

Now she’s gone for I don’t know how long, no visitors allowed and very little phone contact. 

Since the incident. I haven’t eaten in 4 days, I have constant panic attacks it almost feels like she did Die, I know it’s not true and she’s safe but I’m so lost I don’t know what to do.

I’ve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don’t understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

Update: I want to thank every single one of you that has wrote something for me, it makes me feel so much better knowing someone took time out of their day to give advise or encouragement. As of right now I’m at my sisters house, it’s a lot better having an adult to talk to.

I’ve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can’t see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She’s doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

Thank you so much everyone you have helped me more than you know. Now the real work begins."

Update: I want to thank every single one of you that has wrote something for me, it makes me feel so much better knowing someone took time out of their day to give advise or encouragement. As of right now I’m at my sisters house, it’s a lot better having an adult to talk to.

I’ve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can’t see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She’s doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

Thank you so much everyone you have helped me more than you know. Now the real work begins."
wrus19_6544,wrus19,llama,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Last Monday I walked in on my wife taking an excessive amount of very dangerous heart pills. And somehow I was too stupid to realize she wasn’t joking, she wanted to die. Luckily she was talking to her therapist who made her a Safety plan that I thought was a great idea. I got rid of all the guns in the house, all the pills and all was well. About 4 days later she admitted she had picked a day, a time, and how she was going to do it. Which was yesterday at 9 in the morning with about 150 pills she had hid from me. A few phone calls later she was whisked away to a crisis center. 

Now she’s gone for I don’t know how long, no visitors allowed and very little phone contact. 

Since the incident. I haven’t eaten in 4 days, I have constant panic attacks it almost feels like she did Die, I know it’s not true and she’s safe but I’m so lost I don’t know what to do.

I take care of myself as much as I can, I put effort in my makeup hair and clothing.

I want to hide forever. I feel worthless and disgusting. It’s so stupid I know it.

My head of course broke out into the worst migraine of my life, my chest ached to the point I questioned some kind of cardiac episode . Even now I can’t see straight with this headache .

I was only out for about 6 or 7 minutes- but it felt good! I went to the store near my house and picked up some gum and a drink. 

I even cried a little on my way home because I was so proud. Hopefully this is the start of some big changes for me"

You know what, it’s a funny joke. I shouldn’t have made that joke. They’re not laughing. I knew that was a stupid joke to make. They think I’m stupid. Yikes. I wonder if they’re looking at my teeth.
