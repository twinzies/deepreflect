1004g99_5,1004g99,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Throwaway because my wife knows my Reddit. I (25M) managed to somehow get Taylor Swift tour tickets for my wife (24F) and her sister (20F, not really a part of the story). She’s been a big fan of her since she was a kid, and hadn’t been able to get tickets on her own, so I was really happy I could snag them. It was supposed to be her Christmas present, but she found out early because I forgot to close my email (I know, it’s dumb, I’m still kicking myself over it haha). She was really happy, at least, and I’ve heard her talking excitedly with her sister over the phone about it since.

Thing is, since I’d intended for that to be her Christmas present, I didn’t really have anything else for her the day of. I got her a card and a set of paints- real last minute, I know. When we got home from her parents’ place later that week, she told me she was upset that I hadn’t gotten her anything for Christmas. I told her I was sorry and I explained that the tickets were supposed to be her real gift. She doesn’t think it counts though, since it was technically for her and her sister, but she told me when the tickets were first coming out that she and her sister made a pact that neither would go without the other, so that’s what I bought them both tickets. 

I don’t know what to do. She’s not talking to me right now- just texting me if she needs to. I knew she’d be disappointed, but I didn’t think she’d be this upset. AITA?

Update: Her friend’s dog got injured by a stray firecracker last night, and she called me then to tell me she was going to stay over and comfort her friend. She did tell me that she was sorry that she hadn’t been talking to me, and that she would explain everything when she got home. She got home about around 7am and is sleeping in a bit. We’ll talk after breakfast."

Yesterday (Dec 31st), I woke up and he and our son were gone. I could not get in contact with him. I called, tried messenger and text. He replied about three hours later, and would not tell me where they are. 

I had a feeling I knew where they were, at my ex's mother's house. I have told him MULTIPLE times I am not comfortable with our son there due to drugs on the property, her children are borderline violent and she has neglect and abuse charges. We had an argument about our son going there overnight the day before.

He once again stopped responding, still won't tell me where they are. At this point I'm starting to panic and stress. I called the police for advice. 

I'm an absolute wreck now. I'm angry and dumbfounded that he would take off with our son without my knowledge and while I was asleep.

AITA for being angry, upset and concerned?"

1006309_19,1006309,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"My husband has HORRIBLE teeth. He had really poor oral hygiene growing up and his teeth are gross. He’s had to have so many pulled out due to decay and he deals with almost constant tooth aches and gum infections. 

My husband over the past week has been complaining of another toothache. His solution is to usually take a lot of over the counter pain killers and antibiotics until it clears up and then move on. 

He got an inheritance from his grandfather a couple of years ago, he got around $19,000 I told him back then he needed to use it to fix his teeth, instead he got a new computer and a bunch of new tech stuff that he wanted. 

So recently an uncle of mine died and left me around $10,000. My plan was to finally buy myself a car. Probably something second hand but reliable, because I dont have a car. So it’s been sitting in my bank account waiting for me to find a car that I want to buy. 

Well DH mentioned it to his mother the other day and yesterday she approached me and said that “there are better things I could spend that money on.”

I was distracted by cooking dinner and said, “like what.” her response… DH’s teeth. I stopped what I was doing, looked at her and said “DH had a chance to get his teeth fixed when he got his money. I told him to get them fixed back then and he chose not to. I’m not spending all this money on his teeth when I need to get a car to get my kids to school. DH’s teeth were this bad two years ago and he spent his money on crap he didn’t need. Instead of prioritising his health.” 

She said that I was being selfish and I need to step up and help DH. I told her that what she expected me to do isn’t fair. It shouldn’t fall back on me to fix his teeth with my inheritance because he didn’t bother. 

I can see her perspective, he really does need his teeth fixed and if it was as simple as him getting some dentures I’d be more than happy to cover that cost, however he wants to get fancy implant supported dentures which is going to cost around $10,000 if not more. Which would completely wipe out my inheritance. 

I also feel like he spent his payout on fun things for himself when he knew his teeth were an issue, so why should it fall back on me to fix his teeth now because I have the money to do it? 

AITA?

Edited to add: this keeps coming up a lot so… my husband has said nothing about this. He isn’t asking me to spend anything on his teeth. He believes I should spend my inheritance on whatever I want. Only my MIL believes I should spend it on my husband."

stf1pl_32,stf1pl,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Ok, so I had been dating this woman for a year and a half. Right before Xmas, she acted as if she wanted to break up (we had a fight, and she askEd for her apartment key back etc.) I then made plans to go overseas with my brother for both Xmas and New Year. This upset her to the point where she went out and met a guy who worked as a DJ at a local bar on New Year’s Eve. They spent a few dates together: dinners, motorcycle riding, and walking on the beach. He’d also been over to her place a few times (she said at one point she was drying her hair after a shower while he sat on her bed.) This dating period happened between New Year’s Eve and about Jan. 15th or so. She and I then made up and she decided not to date him anymore. She told me she didn’t sleep with him while they were “dating” these 2 weeks. Before she broke up with him to see me again, he’d given her a “promise” ring, bought her an engagement ring, which she said she refused to accept, left his motorcycle at her place, and also had attempted to leave his clothes at her place so he could change before going to work (he lives about 25 minutes out of town and works in town.) He’d taken to store her stuff in his storage unit, and from what I gathered, she’d told him a lot about us and our relationship. He professed to love her and wanted to marry her, tomorrow if he could. Here are my questions:

1. Can a guy fall in love with a woman to the point he wants to marry her (I.e. by buying her an engagement ring), even though they have not slept together? Does this sound believable?
2. Does it make sense that a guy who left his motorcycle at her place, wanted to leave clothes so he could change at her place - though they had not slept together or were intimate?
3. Can a guy be that much in love with a woman without having never slept with her?

I have decided we needed a break, and have not spoken to her in a week. All because I keep having this nagging doubt that she is not being truthful to me.

AITA for asking these questions? I know we were apart for 2 weeks, but I’d been burned before when a gf slept with someone else. Am I paranoid? Ladies - does this make sense to you? Have you been with a guy whom you’ve never slept with, who wanted to leave his things at your place, wanted to move in, and wanted to marry you - after two weeks of dating? I kept thinking she must have slept with him."

Samuel told us that he had found a new girlfriend and he wanted us to meet her. When she got out of the corner for everyone to see her I was shocked.
I’ll call her Maddy, I used to go to school with her high school and college. 

She always made my life a living hell like spreading rumors, flirting with every boy I liked, and all other sorts of bad things to me. I didn’t say anything to my family about her and just never said anything cause it was the first girl my brother really loved. Months past by and I recently found out I was pregnant with my husband (26). This was our second child (we already had a 4 year old daughter.) Maddy has already met her and I knew she hated my daughter. A couple of months pass by and I get a call from my mother saying how could I do this to my husband and the family. 

I drove to my parents house where everybody was there I asked her what she meant. She told me exactly “ Maddy told us how you cheated on your husband and it’s not his daughter.” I told her that it was not true and Maddy was lying about it. But they did not believe me and instead said I was not coming to the wedding anymore. I asked what wedding and apparently Samuel asked her to marry him. She said yes knowing it would make me mad. I told them that’s fine I would not be bothered to go to their wedding.

Also here is another stupid thing that she did, she had them schedule the wedding a week before my due date knowing that I was planning to stay at home to rest for that month. After the wedding my family invited me over to their house to talk again cause they needed to say something. I went there but I didn’t take my children cause I had a baby boy but they weren’t there. I went in and sat down. They saw that I had my child earlier than expected and wanted to see him.

I told them that I delivered that baby early cause of all the stress you gave me thinking that you weren’t there to support me why would I just let you back in my life afterwards. Maddy got up and apologized and said she really wanted to see her niece. I told her that she wasn’t going to see him after she lied and all the thing she put me through in school. I left and did not go back there and stopped talking to them.

I've pretty much tried everything under the sun to get her to care but she still refuses to make an effort and then complains about her body. She knows full well that I'm not attracted to women that look like she does now, but still tries to initiate sex and then acts depressed when I'm not in the mood. We haven't had sex in about year. She's still my best friend and I would rather be with her without sex than without her and with sex. It's just a huge strain on our relationship.

Before anyone whines about body shaming or anything like that, my preferences are my own and she was fully aware of them before we got married.

I love my father dearly, and I want to honor him by giving my son his first name as a middle name. My husband (35M) is mad about it because he doesn’t like my dad. He doesn’t like my dad because he doesn’t agree with the reason why my parents divorced 20 years ago- my dad cheated on my mom. My husband says that he doesn’t want our son to be named (even though it’s a middle name) after a cheater. Mind you- both my parents love my husband, they’re both nothing but nice and respectful to my husband. My dad likes to joke around with my husband, the way that a father in law would, but my father has never been disrespectful toward my husband. I can’t say the same for my MIL and FIL. My dad always asks how my husband is doing when he’s not around, and inquires about his well-being. My husband just doesn’t like that my dad was a cheater, even though my parents divorce has nothing to do with my husband. 

I think my husband is being petty. But I don’t know, we’ve been having a fight about my husbands opinion of my father even before I became pregnant. He just doesn’t seem to understand that my father left my mom, he didn’t leave me. He’s always been there for me. 

My husband didn’t have any boy names picked out, and he got to name our daughter (I didn’t have any girl names picked out when we found out we were having a girl). We both like our sons first name just fine, we both agreed on it. All I want is to  give my son a middle name that’s after my father. And my husband just doesn’t approve. 

Am I being insensitive?"

I started a new job 2 years ago and noticed just how respectful the men were to women. They value their opinions speak to them as equals and treat them as their values and views matter. This is when I realised that this does not happen in my house. I have been surrounded by my partner and all of his friends for my entire adult life. I do 95% of housework. He has “helped” cook 4 meals throughout the years. I have never witnessed him hoover unload a dishwasher or clean up after himself. He has never done a night feed and likes to point out when I don’t do these things right.
We both have full time jobs but he does freelance work in the evenings and weekends too. He comes home anywhere between 9 and 12 every night is gone every Saturday and most Sundays meaning that the entire running of the house lies with me. All bills are also in my name so all the pressure and responsibilities are mine.
This all came to a head when I brought it to his attention that I was overwhelmed with everything and I wanted him to be at home more often and help me. He said that he had noticed I was in a bad mood all the time and my mental health was suffering. He basically said that this was a “me” problem and I was taking my anxiety out on him. I believed him for a day or so. 
Now I’m digging my heals in I’ve asked him to leave (our house is toxic we haven’t spoken in 2 months) he won’t go. So we went to therapy. He’s angry as in FURIOUS with me for not talking to him for 2 months (to be clear he hasn’t tried to talk to me either except a text that said “come and sort this out I don’t want you blaming me for you being depressed in a few weeks”) 
I know this will all be ok if I just “admit” that I’m anxious and I was “taking it out on him” but it’s not true. I just wanted a partner to help raise our children. I don’t believe there’s anything wrong with me! Please help"

I tried TaskRabbit, and a few other services, and they said no, because they only do curbside puck up for deliveries. The store is 1 hour from my house. 

So I decided to see if on a neighborhood site and FB I posted to see if any friends could help me out over the weekend when they were in stock at the store. 

The neighborhood site is now telling people I am a scammer because I said I would pay the person back IF they picked up the items and brought them to me.  

I would not pay them for the items ahead of buying them but when they delivered them, I would give them cash, Venmo. Zelle, or Apple pay.  (All just like cash and I cannot reverse).

The community people convince the people that I was trying to scam them. How I would be scamming someone, I dunno.  Because the only one that would be likely to lose anything would be if I paid and they did not get the item or return mu money I would be the one loosing money. 

I had 3 People say they would go and then flake out. And then they told me that the people convinced it was a scam.  And the neigbors have been coming to my lawn and trowing trash in the yard and screaming at me.  

I have done this many many times before and never had people think it was a big deal. Of course, you go and pay because if it is not there, why would I pay you for the item, and if something is out of stock the amount will be different. 

This one guy said he would help me out when they come back in stock.  And I was like OK, I will let you know when they are back.  

Now this guy is saying he will only bring me the cabinets if I drive there, but them in the cart myself, Pay for them, and load them in his car?!?!?!

AITAH here for telling him that completely defeats the purpose of me hiring him. Why not just rent me your car for $25 instead.  I could send an Uber to my house for less than I was planning to pay him to Why would I pay him to waste 2-3 hours of my time and to basically do it myself. 

BTW I was paying him $150 and reimbursing the cost of the items and the normal delivery for the store is only $60."

Background: My Husband (32) and I (32) have a 6 month old baby, and I have 2 daughters (5 &amp; 10) from a previous marriage. My MIL has been very nice and involved the whole time we have been together. My FIL was nothing but kind to my face. 

Before we were married they offered to give us $20,000 for a down-payment on a home AND to co-sign, WOW! I thought they were amazing, my husband was hesitant. Turned out we couldn't find a home in time, covid hit and we both lost our jobs. 

We ended up deciding to get married June 2020 because we weren't sure how long covid would last and didn't want to wait years. They were NOT HAPPY, but said it was due to the rushed nature of it all.

Fast forward to now: my H has a new job thats going great, i have some small side hustles while i stay at home with baby. We are renting his Grandma's house and have the opportunity to purchase it for an amazing deal! Yay! We only need a cosigner because my income is meh, and he has been at his job for less then a year, and they won't consider his bonuses until after the year mark. 

We approach his parents excited that we are ready... They say no. I'm so confused since these past 2 years (almost) we have talked about buying homes and nothing changed with them. 

Then after many many discussions on what we can do to make them comfortable with being a cosigner (not giving us $, we will refinance at the end of the year... etc.) They tell my husband that it's because they think I will divorce him and then my kids (from my previous marriage) will get the house.....

I'm so hurt and confused since I am a decent human being, have been in a great relationship with their son AND WE JUST HAD A BABY! 

The cherry on top was his Dad saying he never should have married me because of the kids... 

My H was not surprised at all by this and is also just hurt. 

AITA for wanting to never see them again? Keep in mind that would mean they never see their granddaughter who they seemingly adore."

ts2wpa_134,ts2wpa,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I know the title of this might be alarming, but please bear with me for this! Also, my husband IS supportive of my side of things, rather than his mothers side of things. 

Let’s go all the way back to April of 2021, when my husband and I decided to tell my MIL that we got our first apartment, and I am pregnant! (We lived On the west coast and she lives on the east coast) My husband called to tell her about our very exciting news, and she had the nerve to say “None of that is good news to me. I hope you don’t think you’re unpacking your things! You simply cannot live so far away” (that second sentence was meant only for my husband) 
I told her that if my pregnancy was bad news, then she had no right to know the gender of, or ever meet, her grand child. Then I stormed off into our new apartment and slammed the door, followed by angry crying in my new bedroom, because hormones from pregnancy and just the fact that I’m a very emotional person in general. 
Fast forward a bit to a few days after my sons birth, she calls my husband to tell him that she hates our sons name because it’s androgynous and that disgusts her. My husband mentions that I am in the vehicle with him and she is on speaker, and she follows with “I can’t believe (me) had a c-section! That’s so disgusting. You should have done it at home natur-“ she got cut off by me grabbing my husbands phone and hanging up on her. 
Fast forward a bit more, my son is almost 2 months old, and one of my husbands friends decided to try to kick my son in the face (MY 7 WEEK OLD INFANT!?), this “friend” also decided to say that he wanted to end the lives of me, my husband, and my son. So we moved back to the east coast and are staying with my husbands parents until we have saved enough to get our own place out here. (It’s way too expensive with only one of us working) 
In January (2022) my MIL told me “it’s very disappointing that (husband) married you and not his ex (he has a child with an ex). (My step son) deserves to have his parents together and married, whether or not they are happy and love eachother. It is Gods plan. God wants my son to leave you and marry (ex girlfriend)” 
In the same breath, she told me “please don’t be offended by this, but it’s very unfortunate that (my son) wasn’t a miscarriage” and then fucking left the conversation at that!?!?!? I have hardly spoken to her since then, even though I live with her for now. 
In February I allowed her to spend time with my son alone for an hour, he came back with cuts and bruises all over his face. When I asked what the hell happened she said “if it was important, you would know.” 
She has referred to my son as “it” and “the kid who lives here”, yet refers to my step son as “my grandson” and “my sweet little boy” 
She refuses to allow my husband and I to introduce our son to his great grandmother, because “if she knew (husband) had ANOTHER child she would die”. 
She shames me for formula feeding now that he’s 5 months old (breast feeding made me sick to the point I’d have to be practically carried to the bathroom because I was so weak). 
She threatened to breast feed my son herself. 
She constantly talks about how I’m too fat which must mean that I’m pregnant again. (I have PCOS and I literally JUST GAVE BIRTH 4.5 months ago. I’m still recovering from the complications I had in my surgery, which left me paralyzed from the waist down for a few months.) 
She swears I’m a terrible mother because I fed my 5 month old child food that was made for 4-6 month old children. (Gerber supported sitter food. He sits all on his own, but I started him at the very first level) 
She swears I’m a terrible mother because my son cries sometimes, you know, like how literally all babies who ever existed do? Because they’re hungry, or gassy, or they shit themselves!? Somehow I’m horrible because he should never be crying and I should always know what he wants and needs before he even knows. 
She says I have no self respect and no respect for myself because I own an Unus Annus hoodie and wall flag, and they have skulls on them which also must mean that I worship satan. (Her words. Not mine) 
She says I’m a terrible mother because I want to bathe my son once or twice a week, and she believes he shouldn’t have his first bath until he’s a year old. 
She yelled at me for changing his diaper because she believes he should only be changed if it has poop in it. 
She yelled at me for feeding him 4 ounces of formula, which is what his doctor said he should be eating, and yelled that he should be eating 5 ounces. (He was 2 months old!!! He didn’t start eating 5 ounces until today)
Now it’s March, and I allowed her to spend time with my son alone again today because I had to take a shower and my husband was at work, when I got my son back, he had a black eye. When I asked what happened, I was told “nothing! It’s not important, do you really think I’d keep something important from you?” 
And so I snapped. I told her that she has no right to ever even look in the same direction as my son again. I told her she doesn’t deserve his laughs and his smiles, she doesn’t deserve his happiness. He’s the happiest person I’ve ever met, always smiling and laughing and rarely every cries, and she’s not allowed to be a part of his happiness anymore. I’m fed up, my son deserves better, and I will not keep allowing him to be treated less than human by a grandmother who doesn’t love him. 

This ends my summary of why I’m asking “AITA”. So so so so so much more has happened, but this is the shortest I could make it. 
She has also threatened me multiple times and poisoned me 4 times. I’m convinced she’s attempting to end my life, and I’m scared for what could happen to my son if she were ever successful. 
If anyone needs clarification on any of this, do let me know. With that being said, I’m going to go to bed, as it is 6AM and I’ve got to be up in 2 hours."
ts2wpa_136,ts2wpa,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I know the title of this might be alarming, but please bear with me for this! Also, my husband IS supportive of my side of things, rather than his mothers side of things. 

Let’s go all the way back to April of 2021, when my husband and I decided to tell my MIL that we got our first apartment, and I am pregnant! (We lived On the west coast and she lives on the east coast) My husband called to tell her about our very exciting news, and she had the nerve to say “None of that is good news to me. I hope you don’t think you’re unpacking your things! You simply cannot live so far away” (that second sentence was meant only for my husband) 
I told her that if my pregnancy was bad news, then she had no right to know the gender of, or ever meet, her grand child. Then I stormed off into our new apartment and slammed the door, followed by angry crying in my new bedroom, because hormones from pregnancy and just the fact that I’m a very emotional person in general. 
Fast forward a bit to a few days after my sons birth, she calls my husband to tell him that she hates our sons name because it’s androgynous and that disgusts her. My husband mentions that I am in the vehicle with him and she is on speaker, and she follows with “I can’t believe (me) had a c-section! That’s so disgusting. You should have done it at home natur-“ she got cut off by me grabbing my husbands phone and hanging up on her. 
Fast forward a bit more, my son is almost 2 months old, and one of my husbands friends decided to try to kick my son in the face (MY 7 WEEK OLD INFANT!?), this “friend” also decided to say that he wanted to end the lives of me, my husband, and my son. So we moved back to the east coast and are staying with my husbands parents until we have saved enough to get our own place out here. (It’s way too expensive with only one of us working) 
In January (2022) my MIL told me “it’s very disappointing that (husband) married you and not his ex (he has a child with an ex). (My step son) deserves to have his parents together and married, whether or not they are happy and love eachother. It is Gods plan. God wants my son to leave you and marry (ex girlfriend)” 
In the same breath, she told me “please don’t be offended by this, but it’s very unfortunate that (my son) wasn’t a miscarriage” and then fucking left the conversation at that!?!?!? I have hardly spoken to her since then, even though I live with her for now. 
In February I allowed her to spend time with my son alone for an hour, he came back with cuts and bruises all over his face. When I asked what the hell happened she said “if it was important, you would know.” 
She has referred to my son as “it” and “the kid who lives here”, yet refers to my step son as “my grandson” and “my sweet little boy” 
She refuses to allow my husband and I to introduce our son to his great grandmother, because “if she knew (husband) had ANOTHER child she would die”. 
She shames me for formula feeding now that he’s 5 months old (breast feeding made me sick to the point I’d have to be practically carried to the bathroom because I was so weak). 
She threatened to breast feed my son herself. 
She constantly talks about how I’m too fat which must mean that I’m pregnant again. (I have PCOS and I literally JUST GAVE BIRTH 4.5 months ago. I’m still recovering from the complications I had in my surgery, which left me paralyzed from the waist down for a few months.)

Me (19F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for quite some time now, and last year in November I fell pregnant with his child. I talked to him about it and we were trying to decide if we wanted to keep it (I didn’t because he had always told me he was too young and wasn’t ready, our relationship was rocky at the time as well and I didn’t want to force him to stay with me just because I was pregnant) but in the end we decided to work things out and keep the baby. However 4 weeks into the pregnancy, I was walking down the stairs in fluffy socks and slipped. I took a pretty hard tumble and I immediately called him to tell him what happened, later that day I started to cramp and spot. I knew what was happening and broke down. We both struggled with it for a while but eventually came to terms with it thinking it wasn’t the right time. This morning I woke up to a text from him asking what really happened to our unborn child, a whole year after the event. I was confused and asked him what he meant because he already knew the whole story, I asked him why he thought I was lying and he got mad, saying just forget about it, then said he doesn’t want to have kids anymore. I asked him why, and said even though that was his choice it was a deal breaker for a relationship for me because I want to have a family. He said it was because I had killed our child and now he doesn’t trust me. I immediately broke into tears and blew up at him saying he knew it was an accident and it wasn’t my fault I fell down the stairs, I also told him that the fact he thought I did it on purpose and was blaming me was disgusting and really hurt me. We got into an argument that ended with him telling me to f myself, I’m in so much pain and I’m so confused as to why he’d act this way a year later when I thought we had both coped with it during therapy, but I’m wondering if I took it too far by blowing up at him and I just need to know.

I have a beard, and honestly I look nothing like I used to. I never get misgendered in public, it's only my family members who still misgender me. They even misgender me in public and strangers are always confused why they're referring to me as she/her when I look like Jason Momoa (but way less attractive).

Even though I've been out for half a decade, they always say it's too hard, they're too old, ""it just takes time"" and the same excuses. I've put up with it for a long time, but since I've been bringing my fiance around them, it's more embarrassing. My fiance is always surprised when they misgender me, and he asks why I haven't cut them off. 

The problem is I have family members who DO gender me correctly and respect my identity. But hanging around them means I need to hang around the ones who dont. 

My fiance made me realize just how fed up I am with being disrespected and given the same lame excuse even though it's been 5 years. My relatives arent putting any real effort into changing their lens of me. The truth is because they just dont want to. 

So, I started misgendering the relatives that misgender me. I started referring to my mom with he/him, calling her a man. Same with my aunt, female cousins, and grandma. For my man relatives, I started calling them she/her and referring to them as women. You can imagine how this has gone. 

The first incident occurred when my aunt asked me to hand something to my mom, and I said sure, I'll hand it to him. My non-transphobic aunt asked me why I referred to my mom as him, and I said since she doesn't respect my pronouns, I wont respect hers. My aunt just chuckled.

This is the incident that occurred 2 days ago, my family was out at a restaurant to celebrate my cousin's birthday. Pretty much all my relatives were there, 23 of us at 2 separate tables. My uncle misgendered me, so I misgendered him back. My aunt and fiance were stifling their laughter but my uncle wasn't having it. He asked me if I got him confused with someone else, and I repeated my speech of if he was going to misgender me, I would misgender him back. He started getting angry saying he wasnt a woman, and I said ""neither am I."" This evolved into an argument where my relatives started defending my uncle. Funny how they've never defended me. 

The rest of the dinner was kind of awkward, and I had a few family members say I shouldn't have started a fight when it was my cousins birthday dinner, and it wasn't about me. I think I might have been the asshole for sort of ruining my cousins birthday dinner and making it awkward, but on the other hand a few relatives have actually started gendering me more correctly after that whole thing. I dont really know if Im the asshole because it's been 5 f*cking years and Im fed up with being treated this way. Am I the asshole"

So last night i had a birthday dinner for myself and i insisted to make my family dinner because i had learned to make new dishes in cooking class in school. I made 5 dishes for my family, adobo, sushi, rice paper rolls, korean hot dogs and green tea ice cream. All of my siblings and sister in law came and wish me happy birthday and i put all of the food in the middle of the table for everyone to serve themselves. Me and my sister in law have never gotten along but i try and be nice to her but she has always hated me for no reason. Everyone was enjoying my cooking but my sister and i noticed my sister in law wasn't eating anything I made so Ivy asked ""How come you aren't eating?"" then my sister in law replied with ""None of this food is normal for my baby."" Everyone was stunned and didn't say anything. My sister in law was expecting everyone to congratulate her and shift topics about my birthday. She asked everyone why we weren't happy for her, i simply said ""Because you want the attention i'm getting, you could have told everyone your pregnant yesterday or tomorrow but of course you need the spotlight on you."" My sister chuckled a little and my sister in law got angry saying ""You can't have all of the attention on you 24/7."" you may say ""Maybe she didn't know it was your birthday."" She did know, even asked me 2 hours before what she should wear. Anyways my sister in law stormed upstairs and went into my room and locked the door. I had just gotten thousands of dollars worth of gifts that morning because my parents are very well off. We all heard glass smashing and we all bolted up stairs. My brother Matt told her to come out and they could go home and just talk everything out. She screamed at him saying ""Your sister doesn't deserve this life my baby does."" My dad rammed into the door to break it down and it didn't work the first time, so my brothers and him broke it down. I found all of my presents broken or covered in my paint. I broke down and yelled at her saying ""You just had to ruin my happy moment, I wanted one day where everyone got a long but no you ruined it."" My brother told me i should of kept quiet and just let it go because the presents can be replaced.

The dad is her FWB who she is falling for who is not interested in a relationship with her at all. He has no education and works for a construction company.

To start this out I (48F) just got married, this is my third time and I wanted this time to be truly special. So I spent a bit extra on party favors, looking for something special. I found this cute shop on Etsy that had wooden wick candles, since I was planning on ordering a large amount I decided on messaging this owner and getting a special pricing on them. I went through everything with them and ended up getting a custom scent and special label. The woman sent me a quote, and it was a bit higher than what I could have gotten at a regular shop but I wanted something a little bit better. She said something about since they are beeswax they are a little more expensive to make, and she was including shipping in that price even though her shop boasts free shipping. It’s only 200 candles, it can’t really be that hard to make and ship. 

Anyhow, I paid and it shipped. They came and they were amazing, definitely worth every penny. I had my wedding planner work on adding them to the centerpieces and aisle and they made the night so much prettier with their soft flames and lavender scent. I used them all half way down, burning them for most of the day. 

After the event I had all of these candles around and I was beginning to think about the amount I purchased them for when I had only used like half of the candle. So I put in a request for a refund, I put in the reason box that they were defective. She messaged me asking about the issue I had put in and I told her that I didn’t like them and I wanted a refund. She told me that as long as they weren’t used she could accept the return and I could get a refund while covering shipping back, as if I hadn’t already paid for it once. I told her that I wanted the refund right away and I would send them back after. She said that her refund information was on her page and she couldn’t budge on it. More like she wouldn’t. 

So I found the card she sent with the package and I called her and told her how I felt about her policies and that I would be filing a complaint against her. She sounded young and I thought I had made an impression on her, expecting my refund to be on the way as soon as I hung up. However she didn’t do this, so I called again but I must have lost service because when she picked up and I said hello the call dropped. I called several more times but they all went to voicemail, don’t worry I left her plenty. I then left her a bad review because her customer service was terrible.

My niece (22F) asked about the candles about a week after my wedding, and I told her about the whole ordeal I had to deal with. She told some of her friends and her siblings and now the younger side of my family found out and is upset with me as well as some of the older ones. I talked to my friends and they think I was in the right, so I don’t think I’m wrong. My niece told me to come here and see if I’m really the AH?"

To start this out I (48F) just got married, this is my third time and I wanted this time to be truly special. So I spent a bit extra on party favors, looking for something special. I found this cute shop on Etsy that had wooden wick candles, since I was planning on ordering a large amount I decided on messaging this owner and getting a special pricing on them. I went through everything with them and ended up getting a custom scent and special label. The woman sent me a quote, and it was a bit higher than what I could have gotten at a regular shop but I wanted something a little bit better. She said something about since they are beeswax they are a little more expensive to make, and she was including shipping in that price even though her shop boasts free shipping. It’s only 200 candles, it can’t really be that hard to make and ship. 

Anyhow, I paid and it shipped. They came and they were amazing, definitely worth every penny. I had my wedding planner work on adding them to the centerpieces and aisle and they made the night so much prettier with their soft flames and lavender scent. I used them all half way down, burning them for most of the day.

Me and Chris have 2 daughters (16 and 14 female) me and my daughters look just alike, we get mistaken for sister. Alyssa is jealous and said that she didn’t want to see them at their wedding, i’m assuming she doesn’t want to see them because they look just like me. So  Alyssa has got into Chris’s ear and told him to pick between our daughter or her, Chris choose Alyssa. A couple weeks ago he sent me a text say he didn’t want to be in our daughter life anymore he wanted to go no contact but he offered to pay child support. I declined the child support and asked him what he wanted to tell our daughter and he said what ever feels right to me. I told my daughter and they were heart broken. Soon my youngest daughters freshman dance was coming up and she wanted to get a dress, so i invited my ex MIL to go dress shopping with me. My daughter found a beautiful dress and went to try it on.  While in the dressing room my MIL broke down saying i was a whore who took full custody because i was jealous. I told her that Chris simple didn’t want to be in the girls life. She didn’t believe me so i showed her the text, she was shooked. She didn’t say a thing the remaining time dress shopping . A couple hours after we got home, Chris called me. I picked and it was Alyssa cussing me out and calling me names. i was confused and asked her what happened and apparently MIL told her sons (my BIL’s) and they beat the shit out of Chris and it landed him in the hospital. Am i the asshole? (sorry for the misspelling i was literally shaking writing this)"

Sexual gestures to a child
Non consensual touching 
Gaslighting 

To start I am a new mother (26F) my husband is (25M) our daughter is now 6 months. 

To start this story I would have to go back to when I found out i was pregnant at exactly 4 weeks. I was overjoyed as me and my husband funny enough just gave up after 5 years of trying. I had a lot of fertility problems so I drove home to tell him. Funny he guessed  it before I said it. So he calls his father I call my mother.

Fast forward a several weeks we visit family and my husband's father is . . . Friendlier to say and touching me . . . . A lot now I thought he was excited to be a grandpa for the first time. So reluctantly I stayed quiet.

I go to several doctors appointments every week and ultrasounds every other because they noticed some things and talking to the grandparents they brush it off saying I worry to much and they were reluctant to hear what I had to say. 
After my husband and I found out the gender we were having a girl I admit I was worried as a woman I knew how hard life was going to be for her. After the grandparents found out let's say . . . . Grandpa was . . . More touchy Feely and never asked to touch he just did as he pleased and that bothered me and I mentioned it to my husband but he said ""that's just who he is""

 fast forward I go into labor at 35 weeks and my water broke I had to have a c-section.

 After hearing that the grandparents sat outside the hospital even though it was covid and i was only allowed 1 person the whole stay. And his dad was very persistent about coming up and kept asking my husband to give him a turn and not to be selfish.
 Now because she was premature she did have to be on lights and had to leave for several test but they were surprised at how healthy she was for hardly reaching 5 pounds but she still needed to be fed through a syringe because I said no to a feeding tube. 

My husband convinced him to leave but the next day the father in law  shows up walks into the room and just as the nurse is about to hand me my baby he swoops in taking her from me not washing his hands or wearing a mask. I got mad but kept my cool. She started to cry and I said she was hungry as a mom idk how it works I just knew what she needed not to mention she nedded a certain amount of drops every hour for the first 2 /3 days. He  refused and continued to walk away from me. 

Not until my husband waked in did he then hand the baby back to me. 

That's only the start ant time he would see me and if my husband was nit with me he would rip her out of my arms and run away with her into another room I would always follow and he would keep doing it until my husband came back. I also had a few simple rules that I followed even though I'm her mom I was careful. 

It was east  you Can NOT kiss her face ot hands being premature she had a week immune system but grandpa never listened I would have to scold him every time like a child and any time I tried to change her he would come up and try taking photos or be in our business. Now this was huge red flags and caused me to panic and no way to deal with it I had panic attacks. I never had them before.

This happens for months and I had to make up excuses not to see them or to take her away from them.  As I always fell sick 3 days after seeing them because he would kiss her face and hands secretly. I was scared as to what else he would do if I was not watching. Not to mention when breastfeeding he would come up and touch her and try taking her away saying shes not hungry.

Fast forward I got kidnapped by doctors because I asked for something for my anxiety and sleep as his parents were making it worse. So I was detainlost for 3 days and as soon as I'm in I get my phone call and my husband is at home.  . . . With his grandfather I lost it I told him not to tell anyone and not to give her to his father.

 Fast forward I'm out and he brags how she couldn't sleep without him when both my husband and his mother told me she had to sleep on grandma each night. 

At this point  noticed he's trying to make me mad. So to make him mad I would offer for anyone to hold her but him but as soon as I did they would practically throw her to him like some kind of cult. I also ask on FB that they were posting photos after I said no posting publicly  and in all the photos they croped me out and they are all say things like ""grandpa's little girl!"" And "" look at my baby!!!"" Now at this point I there daughter(29F) also was pregnant. I was excited hoping they would leave me alone. But he didn't touch her once or feel her belly I already saw how he treated me vs his actual daughter.

 I'm literally at my braking point so I say no more any time he come over I leave the house. But now he randomly shows up Un announced when he's a 45min drive away. At one point he said ""you should let her stay the night with grandpa so you both can get a break"" I lost it I said no as cold as I could. Then my husband and his mother try to change my mind and I got loud.

 NO 

After that we abruptly left and I've never yelled at my husband in the past 8 years but I let him have it. Then he said ""your being paranoid"" 

Then last week at grandfather's mothers 80th birthday he ripped her away from me in middle of a restaurant kissing her face her hands in his mouth and tried to feed her ice cream!! We just started solids and I was so shocked I dropped my ice cream. And I said NO NO NO. I was so mad everyone could feel the tension as he looked at me with a smug smile as he would kiss her weirdly close to her face. And I saw his hand pinch her nipple He then said something about her hand and how ""she will have fun with that later"" with a  Disgusting gesture. He laughed but no one else did as they looked to me I was about to scream!!!! He said it was a harmels joke! 

 I ripped her away from him and said i was leaving. I talked to my husband and he had nothing to say I was in shock and knew I was alone in being the only  protector from this 6""8 foot preditor.

So AITAH for wanting to cut them out completely and never have her around them.

******update******
Thank you all who gave me courage and advice!!!  I spilled everything to my husband and told him of most of the incidents and my thoughts he was quite the whole time. And I of course broke down sobing and i normally dont cry but i was so nervousand saying it aloud was very hard. 
He hugged me and said I should have told him sooner that he trust me as he thinks I'm the best person to protect our baby and will always follow my lead in our baby's health. he didn't know it was to this extent that I was loosing sleep and hunger. And that this specifically was the cause of my stress. He said we can talk more about solutions over the next few days and I asked if we could just not see or speak to his family until we come to an agreement about what we should do. 
Thank you again to everyone's words to give me strength."

She told me off the bat that she does not like giving oral sex but likes to receive it. I respected her boundaries due to the fact that it is her body and I can not force her to do something she just does not want to do. I feel like I should mention with me not receiving anything I was still giving.  I never really questioned her about why she does not enjoy giving oral sex until 1 week before our wedding. I asked her “why don’t you enjoy giving oral sex” I also made it very clear that she does not have to answer the question if she does not want to. She simply explained to me she does not like to do it because us men urinate out of that area and that area gets sweaty. I completely understood her reasoning and went on about my day.  A week after that we had a lovely wedding, we also went to Cancun for our honeymoon. During our honeymoon we was doing the devils tango and I was giving. Once she finished I looked at her and asked if tonight could be the night she also gives just for the occasion. She agreed . She was only down there for a few seconds when she started to gag while saying that she can’t do this. She came back up and told me she was no longer in the mood. After that I was distraught I felt as if I had horrible hygiene but I knew that couldn’t be it. I decided enough was enough. After our honeymoon we was back home doing the devils tango once again. But this time I refused to give. She asked me why I was not giving. I simply told her it is because I do not enjoy giving. She asked why and I told her it is because she has discharge and sweat coming from her area throughout  the day and also because she urinates from that part.

The worst thing I can remember about her is one day, during a Thanksgiving parade put on by the kindergarteners, me and a few other kids were in her classroom doing late assignments while the other kids watched the parade. Another teacher, Let's call him Mr. Paul, walked in and asked what we were doing in there instead of watching the parade. That horrid woman said ""these are the kids who chose not to do their work, they're your problem next year. She said this right in front of us and looked at me directly. However, despite how she destroyed my confidence and made me feel worthless, I succeeded to the point where I am now pursuing a degree and getting all As and Bs. I recently found her insta and saw that she's now a counselor for kids with depression, anxiety and self-esteem issues. all the things she gave to me before I was 12. I still can't forgive what she did to me as a kid so I sent her a message laying out all the horrible things she did to me and other kids while she was a teacher. AITA?

EDIT: This is the message: ""You may not remember me; I was a student of yours at (school name redacted) 10 years ago. All I have to say is how ironic it is that your job is helping kids with their self-esteem when you actively worked to destroy mine when I was only 9 years old. I've blocked out most of my memories from that horrific school but I remember how you belittled me and many other students who struggled with academics in front of our peers and staff. You once even referred to me and a few other students as a problem to another teacher in front of us. And now you claim to help kids with anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues? All things you gave to me before I was even 12 by the way. You preach kindness when you were the meanest woman I had ever met. It took years for my future teachers to undo the damage you had done. I went into middle school and high school believing I was stupid and worthless because that's how you made me feel. Thankfully I have succeeded and continue to succeed despite you and how you made me feel. I am now pursuing a college degree and am more successful than you ever led me to believe I could be. I kept going and never gave up even when I easily could have all to spite you and what you made me think I was worth. So, thank you for giving me a reason to keep going I guess."""

Another teacher, Let's call him Mr. Paul, walked in and asked what we were doing in there instead of watching the parade. That horrid woman said ""these are the kids who chose not to do their work, they're your problem next year. She said this right in front of us and looked at me directly. However, despite how she destroyed my confidence and made me feel worthless, I succeeded to the point where I am now pursuing a degree and getting all As and Bs. I recently found her insta and saw that she's now a counselor for kids with depression, anxiety and self-esteem issues. all the things she gave to me before I was 12. I still can't forgive what she did to me as a kid so I sent her a message laying out all the horrible things she did to me and other kids while she was a teacher. AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: This is the message: ""You may not remember me; I was a student of yours at (school name redacted) 10 years ago. All I have to say is how ironic it is that your job is helping kids with their self-esteem when you actively worked to destroy mine when I was only 9 years old. I've blocked out most of my memories from that horrific school but I remember how you belittled me and many other students who struggled with academics in front of our peers and staff. You once even referred to me and a few other students as a problem to another teacher in front of us. And now you claim to help kids with anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues? All things you gave to me before I was even 12 by the way. You preach kindness when you were the meanest woman I had ever met. It took years for my future teachers to undo the damage you had done. I went into middle school and high school believing I was stupid and worthless because that's how you made me feel. Thankfully I have succeeded and continue to succeed despite you and how you made me feel. I am now pursuing a college degree and am more successful than you ever led me to believe I could be. I kept going and never gave up even when I easily could have all to spite you and what you made me think I was worth. So, thank you for giving me a reason to keep going I guess."""
ugwzk2_242,ugwzk2,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"I sound like a horrible person but hear me out. i have a little sister who is 11F and is the most brattiest person you could ever meet. She is the youngest, gets everything she wants, has millions of electronics and is overall annoying. She is never grateful for anything, fights with our mom and stepdad alot, and only cares about herself. Me on the other hand, im the middle child. I almost NEVER get anything i want, i dont beg for things, i have 1 phone, im grateful for what i get, never argue with our parents and i try to stand up for whats right.

This happened just now. I am grounded because i got suspended from school for slapping a kid, im not aloud to have my phone. My mom gave me my phone back because she saw how miserable i was without it. My stepdad does not know, he will flip shit if he finds out. So today we started argueing over something stupid. I dont remember what it was but i went to get a coke. When i came in the room, she snatches my coke away from me telling me how it wasnt mine? She put it back. I went to go get it and she wouldnt let me have it back. So we started argueing. Its stupid i know. But our stepdad came into the kitchen to tell us to shut the fuck up. She screams, “She has her phone!” I played it off as in “Ok, go get it😐✋” She couldnt find it. It was in my bra i had on. So we start arguing AGAIN and she said “Atleast my dad didnt leave me” Thats what got me.

Me and my little sister have different dads. My dad did drugs when i was younger and left me because he was a bad influence on me and didnt want me growing up around that. HER DAD on the other hand left her for drugs as well. Not to get better and keep her away from that type of stuff, but to start selling drugs. My mom kicked him out. He always got clean and tried coming back around but it never worked out, he always went back to drugs. My dad never did that. This is the part where i think i might’ve been the asshole.

I told her, “Atleast my dad loved me enough to quit drugs rather than going away to start business with them.” She broke down, started crying saying how i shouldnt have said that and i was a freak, a terrible person, etc. I will admit, what i said was petty, but she had no right to comment about my dad knowing damn well my dad was a better influence then hers ever will be. 

We fight like this all the time, its nothing new. But something i should include is when we fight, i dont say things to her. I let her yell at me then its over with. I bottle everything up like your not supposed to. So since i never yell at her, i dont say things like that. But she pissed me off so i let it all out. 

AITA?

Edit: something i should’ve included was that ive never yelled back at her. (like i said) we’ve bene fighting ever since day one and she has mentally AND PHYSICALLY abused me. I wont say bad bcuz she cant hit for shit, but i did go through this for years. I cant fucking take it anymore and for the people saying im the asshole for what i did. I dont really care. If she is aloud to say shit and it be OK with her and my family then i should be aloud to say shit back. If she cant take it back she shouldnt be saying it at all."

Also you guys know that I left her with 1k. She recently called me &amp; told me that she needed more money. When I asked her what said she said bills. I know for a fact that everything put together is a little more then 800$*we live in a very low budget home so that’s why things are so cheap* I asked her how did she run through the 1k already. She explained that she went to the winery again and ended up spending 100$ on wine bottles alone. I told her that it was no longer problem and the money I gave her was suppose to go towards the home &amp; not happy fun time with friends and wine. I also explained to her that I am filing out for divorce. She immediately hung up the phone and drove to the hotel I was staying at. I let her inside of my room so we can talk about it face to face. She said that she does not want a divorce and that she is willing to change. I told her that that ship has sailed and I refuse to continue to try if she does not want to. She asked me what about the money &amp; I told her there are plenary of entry level jobs hiring. I also explained that I quit my 2nd job as bartender because it was to much on me. She got upset with this news and told me I shouldn’t have quit the job. I explained I only took up the 2nd job to make her happy but now that there is no longer me &amp; her I no longer need the 2nd job. I presented the papers out to her. I also told her I want the house *since it was in my name &amp; I was paying the bills* I also stated that she could get half of my earnings only from the bartender gig since I’ve had my security guard job since I was 17 and I have money from that job I refuse to let her touch. She asked me where she was suppose to stay after the divorce was finalized and I told her she is grown and needs to figure it out herself. She left my hotel room and now she is bad talking me to her friends and family. So AITA?

This actually happened today, while I (F19) was informed about the overturn situation going on, I brought it up to my boyfriend (M23) while he was playing games because it was such a shock to me. Before I get in with this, the reason we’re staying at his dads is so we can prepare to move to our new home. However it became difficult because we’re also paying all of his bills as well, also to start with, this was a private conversation between my boyfriend and I. So I’m a pro choice woman, always have been, and I’m very accepting towards other peoples opinions, I mean what’s the fun in anything if everyone believes the same thing, hell, my boyfriend is pro life. Well I bring it up to him and had said it seemed unfair that this situation it going on and expressed how it made me upset. Surprisingly his dad was eavesdropping on our entire conversation, so what does he do? Gets a g*n and sh**ts it in the house then points it at me and gives me a disgusted look. He then yells for my boyfriend to come outside and they start arguing. My boyfriend comes inside and tells my his dad said to “get the f*ck out” in his own words. So I do. I grab my stuff, our cat, and leave for my moms. His dad currently hates me for my beliefs because he is very old school, he believes everyone needs to have the same opinion as him and if you didn’t, he referred to you as a “libtard”, doesn’t make sense. I don’t feel bad one bit for this and don’t feel like I was disrespecting anyone. However my boyfriend is stuck in the middle, he believes his dad overreacted and he’s angry with him, but feels like my opinion is less than his considering everyone in that house is pro life and I’m not. My mom has had my back through this entire thing and believes I should be able to voice my own opinion too. so AITA?"

I had came home ten minutes before my daughters bedtime and decided I was going to read her a book. But when I went up to her room I saw the nanny putting her to sleep with a book in her hand. I asked what she was doing and she said that she was putting her to sleep. 

I said that it was my job to do that since I barely get any motherly bonding experiences with her and she said muttering “ you haven’t been much of a mother anyways”I just shrugged it off and went to sleep. I also found out she was giving my daughter food and taking her outside with no consent from me and my husband. My last straw was today when I had came back from work and I went to sleep after working a 36- hour shift with one break. 

She knocked on my door at six am and I let her in and went back to sleep. A couple minutes later she comes in and tells me to get out. I ask her why and she said because my husband needs privacy and I should go sleep on the couch. I snapped at her and said that she has been treating me like I’m not in my own home and I will not be disrespected further. Me yelling woke my daughter up and she had the audacity to run towards her room and take her.

I pushed her aside and grabbed my daughter to stop her from crying and told the nanny that she was fired. She begged me not to and told me I was the first person to pay her a lot of money(I had been paying her $750 with a +20 bonus fee). I told her she had been rude and disrespectful even when I tried my best to not snap at her but she pushed me so far and I told her to get out. 
When I told my family about this they said they agree with me but then asked if me and my husband slept on the same bed and I told them no cause I bought a deprecate one for me to sleep on due to his injuries. Many others said I was the ass and that she was just doing her job so AITA for firing her?

Edit: I just want to clarify that the food she gave her wasn’t food I had but it was something she bought and I have a list of foods for her to eat and her schedule. Just so you know"

ujw6bo_297,ujw6bo,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (29F, Indian) was an accident-kid. My mom (73F) was a SAHM whose life revolved around my sister (40F), while my dad was struggling to keep the family business afloat. Favoritism was blatant and I always ended up being neglected. My mom spent money on her classical music training, education, wedding, but when it came to me, ‘we are poor’. My mom was so involved in my her, that she never noticed my new introversion and binge eating disorder which were results of me being molested at 14. She always pointed out how fat I was and how I’d look better if I lost weight. My sister got married young and had a kid when I was in high school. That was the time my mom had a botched hysterectomy which took 3+ months to heal. I took care of her and my sister’s kid, while my sister earned a living and managed her married life. My mom was frustrated and irritable after her surgery (was 58 at the time) and I’d always be at the receiving end. When I was in undergrad, my sister had kid 2, so my mom took care of both but due to her age was finding it hard to manage. Too afraid to tell her best kid, I’d get to deal with her screaming. During my undergrad, my mom repeatedly fell ill because of her age and her diminished immunity, and I was always there to care for her.

When I graduated, I got a well-paying job. While paying off my debt, I'd take my parents out to fancy places, buy them better clothes, improvise the house, pay bills, basically do things we wouldn't do because of having no financial means. My sister progressed professionally, but never contributed to our home financially. She would buy clothes as gifts once in a while but my mom always asked her not to, because she had a family. I was depressed in my job because I couldn’t lick my bosses a\*\* and was not allowed to work on good projects for 3 years.

ujw6bo_299,ujw6bo,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (29F, Indian) was an accident-kid. My mom (73F) was a SAHM whose life revolved around my sister (40F), while my dad was struggling to keep the family business afloat. Favoritism was blatant and I always ended up being neglected. My mom spent money on her classical music training, education, wedding, but when it came to me, ‘we are poor’. My mom was so involved in my her, that she never noticed my new introversion and binge eating disorder which were results of me being molested at 14. She always pointed out how fat I was and how I’d look better if I lost weight. My sister got married young and had a kid when I was in high school. That was the time my mom had a botched hysterectomy which took 3+ months to heal. I took care of her and my sister’s kid, while my sister earned a living and managed her married life. My mom was frustrated and irritable after her surgery (was 58 at the time) and I’d always be at the receiving end. When I was in undergrad, my sister had kid 2, so my mom took care of both but due to her age was finding it hard to manage. Too afraid to tell her best kid, I’d get to deal with her screaming. During my undergrad, my mom repeatedly fell ill because of her age and her diminished immunity, and I was always there to care for her.

When I graduated, I got a well-paying job. While paying off my debt, I'd take my parents out to fancy places, buy them better clothes, improvise the house, pay bills, basically do things we wouldn't do because of having no financial means. My sister progressed professionally, but never contributed to our home financially. She would buy clothes as gifts once in a while but my mom always asked her not to, because she had a family. I was depressed in my job because I couldn’t lick my bosses a\*\* and was not allowed to work on good projects for 3 years. I decided to go to the US where I knew I would be appreciated and worked very hard for the exams and applications.

I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) were watching tv the other day. Him and I have been together for 3 years now. Our relationship went pretty smoothly. We met in highschool and have been together since. 

We often watch shows together after school/work. The other day we watched a show where a man undressed himself down to his underwear. My boyfriend asked me to look away, but i thought that he was overreacting so i kept watching. Then he got all upset with me that i was “admiring other men”. I told him that if he doesn’t want me to do that he should lose some pounds herself, since hes been gaining a lot since covid. He got lazy and stopped working out, so obviously my attraction for him has faded. I told him this and he got up, left and hasn’t responded to my texts ever since. I refuse to apologize because its not my fault im not attracted to him anymore, and i think if anything, hes the one that should apologize for not trying to look good for me anymore. 
So AITA?"

I got the vaccine 3 days after it was released to teens. So, when my mom got it, I locked myself in my room refusing to eat or drink. My dad (45M) considered this outrageous, but I didn’t care. Now, three days before her birthday, my dad prepared me by saying I was supposed to eat dinner with my mom, at the same table, with no mask. Now, I wear a mask absolutely everywhere. EVERYWHERE even sometimes in my own house. I know it’s a bit concerning, but I seriously don’t care. I told my father no, I wasn’t going to eat dinner with my mom. He called me a crappy daughter, but I stuck to my morals. On the day of her birthday, I didn’t show in the dining room for dinner. My dad was pissed, and called me a piece of crap daughter. I explained how I was really scared, and he said the lines against me, that I “took care of my boyfriend when he was ill, but I can’t have dinner with my own mom” but, that was different. My boyfriend, Damion (17M) only had a headache, and tested negative 12 times! So, I was okay with taking care of him. Also, my mom had a symptom of a stomachache, and I have emetophobia. My boyfriend didn’t have a stomachache, so I was okay. But now that I think of the incident, I feel super bad. 

Also, since it’s apparently relevant, my mother hates me. She’s an awful mother, and not passionate about raising children whatsoever. I also have an underlying health conditions, leading me to be afraid. According to over 13 doctors, if I get COVID, there’s a 20% chance of hospitalization, and an 8% chance of death. 

For me, I refuse to risk it.

ulzdkl_317,ulzdkl,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,"I (24M) have been with my wife (24F) for 4 years. We got married 9 months ago.

So, in College I considered myself gay, until the second year when I met my wife. I felt attracted to her, but also to guys so I came out as bisexual.
After 2 months of being together, she started telling everyone that I was straight because I was in a relationship with a women. I decided to ignore it and continue our relationship. Everything was great, although she did ask me every once in a while if I still believed that I was bisexual, and of course I kept saying I still am. We had a few fights on this subject, but we managed to keep it cool.

After we got married, at first, she started to put her male and female friends to ""test"" me. I thought i was being tested to see if i was loyal to her,  but in reality it was to confirm if I was straight or not.

 I did not di anything with anyone!

2 weeks ago, I overheard her talking to her best friend about me. The conversation went something like this:

Bff: So how's your husband? Does he still believe that fantasy of him being bi?
Wife: He still confirms that he is, but I doubt it.
Bff: How so?
Wife: Well he never mentioned any men that he was attracted to, if he even likes men. I think he is faking it
Bff: Maybe
Wife: We could say that I turned him straight.
Bff: That's right
 And they both laugh.


Later in the evening I confronted her and she confessed everything to me.

At first she was with me to prove to her friends that she could turn a gay men into a straight one, but then she ""caught "" feelings and continued being with me. And told me that she still jokes around with it.


The next morning I left the house and haven't returned since. My mom is pro lgbt+ and is more offensive than me and is on my side, along with my brothers and sister. My in-laws
are on her side and are calling me an asshole.

umxjy0_324,umxjy0,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,"So I know how the title sounds but hear me out. I (26F) started dating my now bf(35M) we have been dating for 7 months. A month ago he told me he had to talk to me about something important. I honestly thought maybe he just wanted to break up with me but what he said was SO much worse. 

My bf sat me down and said that there was a problem the problem being he’s falling in love with me…. when he said that I got SO confused I didn’t understand what the problem was. I asked him why that was a problem and that’s when he told me that he’s actually married (and has been divorced) and lied about his age (he’s actually 42). I sat there SHOCKED and I didn’t know what to say. When I finally came out of shock I got up grabbed my stuff and told him to NEVER call or text me again. He tried saying what most cheaters do that I was different, his wife and him hadn’t been happy in a really long time, and was considering getting a divorce. I still grabbed my stuff and left I didn’t think twice about it. 

The problem came about two weeks ago my period was 2 months late. I wasn’t worried because I am extremely irregular but after being late for a second month I decided to take a EPT. It was positive…. I thought maybe it was a false positive and took 6 more tests and they were all positive. I was so upset I cried out of shock and anger because of the situation as a whole.  

I called my now ex bf, he didn’t respond. I texted him telling him I needed to talk to him and radio silence. After days of calling and texting, he finally answered the phone and said if I was “pregnant” he didn’t think it was his and stop texting and calling and hung up.

I was livid… how dare he….. I wasn’t the one lying, and cheating.  Now being pregnant I would have to explain to my family the real reason I broke up with him, and tell them I’m pregnant. 

Fast forward to Mother’s Day weekend my family and I went out to dinner Saturday night to celebrate. I’m about 12 weeks along in my pregnancy and have to pee ALL THE TIME. As I was walking to the bathroom I saw my lying ex and he was there with his family or friends and based on body language his wife. I was so hurt and angry about everything, I didn’t think before acting. I went to their table I introduced myself. I told everyone at the table what happened from start to finish, showed them pictures of us together, and texts. As a final note I announced my pregnancy before leaving the table I grabbed his drink and threw it at him. I then looked over at his wife she was bawling I felt so bad but I was so hurt and angry. Did I take it too far AITA?! Should I have done things differently? 

**Edit** 
He doesn’t have children. His wife and him were having dinner with all adults at their table my family was celebrating Mother’s Day.

I’m considering terminating the pregnancy but have not decided one way or the other. 

My ex reached out offering to pay for an abortion because he “doesn’t want a child and never has”


**UPDATE**
His wife reached out to me and wanted to meet up. I met up with her I felt like it was the least I could do after everything that happened. 

She thanked me for everything I did and said, she let me know she filed for divorce. She had enough of the lies and cheating(I was one of many over the time of their marriage). She told me I was the first women to actually present pictures, texts, a pregnancy test, and ultrasound and felt I was being genuine about what happened.

I apologized saying I never wanted to embarrass her, I was just so angry I saw red. I told her if I had known he was married I would have never dated him. She told me to not worry and believed me especially with what I did when I saw him. She apologized to me for everything he did (this woman is a freaking saint she deserves better). We cried about everything we’ve been through, and comforted each other through this mess he created. I felt so much better having a heart to heart with her and wish her the best. 

It was no surprise that he came looking for me begging me to forgive him. I told him to get lost and I never wanted to see him again especially after saying the baby was not his. I wasn’t surprised he tried coming back especially after his wife filed for divorce. 

When it comes to my baby there is also a update….
After a lot of thinking I had decided to keep my baby. Unfortunately I was having issues with some bleeding due to the fetus not being fully attached properly to my uterine wall. While being on bed rest this past week the bleeding got worse and I lost my baby. After having the miscarriage it’s been a very difficult time. I know everything happens for a reason but it really hurts. I have a lot of guilt surrounding the miscarriage because I wanted an abortion so I partially blame myself. So now im just taking sometime to heal and grieve my baby. Thank you for all of the advice and comments."

Living together has had its challenges and we have learned and readjusted to one another. I think now we have finally settled and are happy with each other except for one issue. His cat that his ex left him. 

She is a 6 year old cat who belonged to his ex. When they broke up she refused to take the cat (who was only a year old at the time) and left it with my bf. He said that at first he couldn’t stand her but now he can’t imagine life with out her. She’s helped through several periods of depression and cuddles with him every chance we get. Before we moved in together she was very loving and caring to me but since we moved in she has become a terror. Some examples of this is when I cry (which is often) she will attack me. She also attacks me in my sleep, when I don’t pet her, when I pet her too much, when I am alone, I when I rest on my bf, when I ignore her, when I give her attention…. I can go on. I will note that this is not every day. But usually when she is on her period, in heat, right before she is in heat and after. So I get about a week of peace with her. 

My boyfriend refuses to get her fixed. He believes it’s cruel to take that away from her. It does not matter how many articles I show him or if I offer to pay. I have even found certain foundations that will do the service for free but he still refuses. It has become a worthless fight so I stopped trying. I did my best to avoid her bites and scratches. She didn’t bother me as much so I just let it go. 

Now about 4 months ago I got a puppy, she is supper sweet and is great with our other cat. My bfs cat on the other hand hates my puppy, she hisses at her and scratches her even if my puppy does not provoke her. My bfs cat even hides from the puppy to attack her and these aren’t playful attacks she hurts her. My bf does not see a problem with it and says the puppy will get used to her. 

My final straw was when my puppy and I were on the couch watching tv when bfs cat tried to sit with us. The cat didn’t see puppy sitting and when she did she attacked both me and puppy. I screamed and pushed the cat off of us and she charged back, my bf was in our room and came rushing to see the cat attacking us. He grabbed her in a blanket and threw her in a room and closed the door. 

Here is where I may be an asshole: 
I yelled at him that I wanted he gone when he came back to check on us. I told him that I can’t live with her and I’m tired off being afraid of her. I told him to either get her fixed or I’m taking her to a shelter. I got upset and said that she meant a lot to him and that she helped him through so much. That he’s not going to put her through unnecessary pain, he apologized and I knew he meant it but I was so angry and done with constant terror. I then showed him where I was bleeding and said that this was all his fault.He walked away and went to the room he put the cat in and stayed there with her. This was late night and I hadn’t talked to him since. I’m not sure what to do now, I regret what I said but I am tired of getting all scratched up because he won’t get her fixed. 




TL;DR
My boyfriends cat keeps attacking me  I the ass whole for telling my boyfriend if he does not get his cat fixed I will get rid of her.


*****Edit*****
I did not realize that me crying would be a concern to so many. I appreciate it but I promise I am fine. I do have depression that I am working through but I am also extremely sensitive I will cry at anything especially movies. 
Also I have read all of your comments and I plan on speaking to him when I get off of work today. Thank you for all of your input.


Update*** 
I’m not sure if this is how you update on here but here I go. 

First thing first I want to clarify some things. I did not want to get rid of his cat out of cruelty or jealousy. I believed he was not properly caring for her by refusing to get her fixed and for allowing her to become so violent. I also did not care where she came from and I only brought up his ex to show how much the cat helped him over come. Also the dog was a gift from him since I could not bond with the dog, I picked it out and he paid for it so it was a mutual decision. 

Now the update. 
We talked a lot last night and about the true reasons why he would not get her fixed. He was afraid she would loose her personality and no longer love him. He was afraid that he would loose her if she got spayed. I assured him that she would always love him and that she needs this done. We read through the comments and he understood where I was coming from but ultimately I really hurt him. I apologized, I took things too far and he apologized for putting me in that kind of situation. He called the vet today as a check up before he gets the surgery, he also wanted to check if the cats insurance (that I got for her) would cover the procedure. In the meantime we are buying more soothing activities for her and moving the puppies things out of our room so she has her own separate space.

Thank you all for your comments we both really appreciate it!"

Also I have read all of your comments and I plan on speaking to him when I get off of work today. Thank you for all of your input.


Update*** 
I’m not sure if this is how you update on here but here I go. 

First thing first I want to clarify some things. I did not want to get rid of his cat out of cruelty or jealousy. I believed he was not properly caring for her by refusing to get her fixed and for allowing her to become so violent. I also did not care where she came from and I only brought up his ex to show how much the cat helped him over come. Also the dog was a gift from him since I could not bond with the dog, I picked it out and he paid for it so it was a mutual decision. 

Now the update. 
We talked a lot last night and about the true reasons why he would not get her fixed. He was afraid she would loose her personality and no longer love him. He was afraid that he would loose her if she got spayed. I assured him that she would always love him and that she needs this done. We read through the comments and he understood where I was coming from but ultimately I really hurt him. I apologized, I took things too far and he apologized for putting me in that kind of situation. He called the vet today as a check up before he gets the surgery, he also wanted to check if the cats insurance (that I got for her) would cover the procedure. In the meantime we are buying more soothing activities for her and moving the puppies things out of our room so she has her own separate space.

Thank you all for your comments we both really appreciate it!"

uok1bs_345,uok1bs,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I(20f) recently moved into a house with 3 other people. Jane(21f) my longtime friend, Mark(24M) friend of Janes, And Kyle(23M) Childhood friend of Marks. I had hangout with Mark a few times before moving in but had never met Kyle. They all seemed chill and that is what I was looking for in roommates.

Jane, Mark and I are all pretty social and like to go out or have friends over a lot while Kyle likes to keep to himself. We always invite him though incase he wants to come along. He is a bit awkward with me but I think he just needs time to get used to a new person.

Due to some stuff when I was a kid, I have to lock my door in order to fall asleep. I Just will lie awake all night if I don't. I also do this if I am taking a nap during the day and sometimes when I'm in my room just because its a habit. I also get very hot in my room so I have a fan in the window that is very loud. Because of the fan, I cant hear people knock on the door unless they are banging on it.

I have told my roommates that if they need to talk to me and my door is locked I wont hear them, so they should just send me a text and ill open the door. for some reason this really bothers Kyle. I woke up form a nap once to him banging on the door and when I opened the door he wanted to know why I hadn't responded. I told him I was asleep and I cant hear with my fan on. He said that I should leave the door unlocked incase someone needs me. I told him he could text me and if I didn't respond, I was mostlikly asleep and would talk to him later. He asked what about an emergency or a fire? I told him that I couldn't sleep without the lock so I guess Ill have to take my chances.

Now He is acting all mad at me and keeps making comments about how its really dangerous and he doesn't understand why I am locking them all out.(I told him the vague reason but I don't want to give more details) I also was sitting at my desk last night when I usually would have been asleep for a while. The desk is right next to the door so I can actually hear things. I heard someone walkup to my door and giggle the doorknob. I didn't check who it was but I think it was Kyle.

I asked my other roommates about this and Jane said she wasn't offended by me locking the door and to ignore Kyle. Mark said that he wasn't offended and that Kyle has always been intense about weird things. He said that Kyle is protective over girls and I should just try to avoid the conflict for the sake of peace.

I cant sleep if I unlock the door, but maybe Kyle has a right to be concerned about the fire thing? Would I be TA if I ignored his feelings? I don't really understand why he cares so much.

Update: Today I came home and Kyle was in my room. He was just looking at the books on my shelf but still... after everything I'm not comfortable and I wish he had asked. I didn't tell him to get out or anything though. I asked Mark and Jane if they could talk with me about all this tomorrow because this is all very strange and I don't want to be responsible for hurting his feelings but I also need him to stop. What should I say to Kyle that wont make him mad?"

However, he recently lost his job, so it’s been only me providing the funds, which has been fine, but a little rough on me. I’ve started working later than usual, and he’s been staying home. About two weeks ago, I found out that he was cheating on me with not one, but two other girls. I did my own investigating and found out the two names and social media’s of the girls and reached out to them. Just like I expected, neither of them knew they were being cheated on either. One of them had never been invited to our place, and the other was told I was his cousin living with him part time. We ended up going out to lunch soon after and got a brilliant plan. Both girls were in tough living situations, and I needed help paying rent. So we decided the two of them would move in, and we’d move him out. We did exactly that all in one day. He came home to his stuff in the hallway. He was obviously angry, and was screaming at us calling me a bitch and an asshole. Told me I didn’t know how lucky I was to have his “priority” while the other girls didn’t. We kicked him out and tried our best to enjoy the rest of the night. It was quiet and nice for the next week, but just this week, I’ve gotten calls and texts from him, his family, and even my brother (who was very close with him).

It’s not my fault he doesn’t have a job, and it’s not my fault he cheated. I have two new best friends. But of course, their words still eat at me a little. So I want to know.

They said she has a reputation at her college and a few other things but I was too drunk to remember what they were.

I had been messaging her earlier that day making plans, but after hearing all of this I ended up lashing out at her and telling her that my family would be embarassed if they knew I was talking to her and that we shouldn't hang out anymore. After that I unadded her on everything. Since she is friends with my roommates they heard about me ghosting her and sending those messages. They said I was too harsh. Now I am feeling bad for unadding her on everything and I think I may have been to harsh AITA?

UPDATE: After reading all of your comments I decided to message her and apologize. I explained to her that my roommates told me about her sleeping around when I was intoxicated so I overracted. She told me that it was okay but that it is weird that I would care about that. 

I should also note that she took my virginity which is why I was upset when I found out I was just another number for her. "

They were not married yet and were basically broke college students with a lot of work to do. However, they worked hard and raised me right in my early childhood and we were able to manage. When I was 9, my dad was finally finished with medical school (he got a phD) and my mom earned a masters. They got very good jobs and got married when I was 11. Shortly afterwards, they talked about wanting kids. Now that we were well off and they were married, they wanted “legitimate” kids born after marriage. They had my younger sister, let’s call her Elaine, when I was 12, and sent me away to live with my aunt for several months. I was only invited back after Christmas, 7 months after her birth. Elaine grew up in a much better environment than me and was rather spoiled. When she was 5, my mom got pregnant again and had my little brother “Evan” when I was 17. They sent me to live with my aunt until I was 18 yet again. I had gotten into an good university and asked if they could help pay for my tuition, but they said they wanted to save all the money for my younger siblings because I’d “know how to live” anyways. My aunt helped me out for college instead, and I won some scholarships and got a part time job. Last year, after graduating college, my parents had to pay a hefty sum of money for my grandfather’s surgery using Elaine and Evan’s college savings. My siblings are only 11 and 5, but my parents were panicked and wanted me to give my money to them for their “legitimate” childrens’ college funds. I said no, as they had not helped me when I needed it. They got mad at me and didn’t talk to me for a long time. My aunt and my friends have been saying that I should help my parents out, as they raised me in a time where they didn’t have much and had to work really hard for me.

uuwio6_406,uuwio6,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Ok so this happenend recently and I apologize for any grammar mistakes I will make.

So for context my mother was abusive to me when i was young. After years of fighting with my dad to do anything to help me, he divorced her. The bliss of being free to do what i wanted was quickly destroyed by a new arrival in our home.

Think of her as the evil stepmother and she fits the role perfectly.

She had no compassion or empathy as to what I had been through, but still demanded that I have compassion for her situation, since she came from russia, to our country.

She brought her own daughter too, but for the matter of the story she isn't important.

The day I met her, was the day she moved in with us.

She did all kinds of messed up things, like throwing things at me, yelling and worst of all, manipulating my father, into doing things she wanted.

She wanted a trip out of the city? My father paid for one. She wanted a new phone? She got one.

You get the idea.

She would often incite fights or make things super dramatic by adding fuel to the fire, then running to my father to blame me.

He told me his opinion of me wouldn't change but after years and years of her whispering into his ears, it ended up with him kicking me out.

After a long confusing period of time where I had to figure out where I stood in the world, how to buy and cook food and basically deal with everything adults had to, at the ripe age of 1 month as a 18 year old.

yeah.

I'm ok now, some days are still a struggle for me, but I've been managing it pretty good.

But the reason everything spiralled down into the things it did now, was that I voluntarily hospitalized myself for two weeks. It was to find out what I had and what things I could do to help my mental health.

Some diagnoses weren't a surprise. Others I knew about but needed the definitive proof. But one shook me to my core.

PTSD. I had PTSD.

I just assumed the way I lived was normal and was happening to others too.

But after getting that diagosis, I started rethinking everything critically.

I realised my childhood was anything but normal. That my dad failed me twice but still claimed he loved me.

He didn't protect me now or then. Only thing he cared about was his own happiness. Even if it meant deluding himself into thinking everything was alright. Leaving his only daughter to deal with the consequences of his actions, or rather inactions.

I confronted him over text messages but he wouldn't listen to me. To him it was only one of my ""episodes"". He has no clue about how mental illness works and repeatedly has used wrong and harmful stereotypes against me.

No matter what I said, or what valid points I brought up, it was dismissed.

In my frustration and hurt i told him that if he were to marry that woman, I wouldn't be attending the wedding.

My grandmother told me I went too far and demanded that I apologize to him.

But it's not a lie. I don't want to attend or celebrate someone who had their hand in my PTSD.

So am I the #sshole for telling my father that I wouldn't be attending his wedding if he marrfied his girlfriend?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: thankyou for the kind comments. Its pretty hard to get out of a mindset that basically says blood is thicker than water. But i wanted to clarify a few things.

I still haven't finished school due to my plephora of (previously) undiagnosed mental illnesses.

I'm currently redoing the 12th grade due to a bullying incident, involving 10 or more students, which have caused me to try to unalive myself. (the reason why I went to the hospital)

So I am not able to go NC with my dad or any of my family members.

Since I basically have no work experience or any qualifications, I would end up on the street.

But thankyou for the comments. I genuinely thought I was going crazy bc it seemed like my feelings were always wrong."
uuwio6_408,uuwio6,top-comment,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,"Ok so this happenend recently and I apologize for any grammar mistakes I will make.

So for context my mother was abusive to me when i was young. After years of fighting with my dad to do anything to help me, he divorced her. The bliss of being free to do what i wanted was quickly destroyed by a new arrival in our home.

Think of her as the evil stepmother and she fits the role perfectly.

She had no compassion or empathy as to what I had been through, but still demanded that I have compassion for her situation, since she came from russia, to our country.

She brought her own daughter too, but for the matter of the story she isn't important.

The day I met her, was the day she moved in with us.

She did all kinds of messed up things, like throwing things at me, yelling and worst of all, manipulating my father, into doing things she wanted.

She wanted a trip out of the city? My father paid for one. She wanted a new phone? She got one.

You get the idea.

She would often incite fights or make things super dramatic by adding fuel to the fire, then running to my father to blame me.

He told me his opinion of me wouldn't change but after years and years of her whispering into his ears, it ended up with him kicking me out.

After a long confusing period of time where I had to figure out where I stood in the world, how to buy and cook food and basically deal with everything adults had to, at the ripe age of 1 month as a 18 year old.

yeah.

I'm ok now, some days are still a struggle for me, but I've been managing it pretty good.

But the reason everything spiralled down into the things it did now, was that I voluntarily hospitalized myself for two weeks. It was to find out what I had and what things I could do to help my mental health.

Some diagnoses weren't a surprise. Others I knew about but needed the definitive proof. But one shook me to my core.

PTSD. I had PTSD.

I just assumed the way I lived was normal and was happening to others too.

But after getting that diagosis, I started rethinking everything critically.

I realised my childhood was anything but normal. That my dad failed me twice but still claimed he loved me.

He didn't protect me now or then. Only thing he cared about was his own happiness. Even if it meant deluding himself into thinking everything was alright. Leaving his only daughter to deal with the consequences of his actions, or rather inactions.

I confronted him over text messages but he wouldn't listen to me. To him it was only one of my ""episodes"". He has no clue about how mental illness works and repeatedly has used wrong and harmful stereotypes against me.

No matter what I said, or what valid points I brought up, it was dismissed.

In my frustration and hurt i told him that if he were to marry that woman, I wouldn't be attending the wedding.

My grandmother told me I went too far and demanded that I apologize to him.

But it's not a lie. I don't want to attend or celebrate someone who had their hand in my PTSD.

uvo1xr_414,uvo1xr,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Okay hi guys so I know you guys already know based off of my other story times well the divorce is finally finalized but now my ex wife family is coming for my neck. 

Before me and my ex wife got married I had over 200k in my savings that have been saved up from all of the jobs I’ve had *I started working at age 14* my intent with this 200k was to be able to put myself thru all 7 years of school once I had enough  money.  I already received a 900$ grant that is valid for about 4 years.  Well the divorce process was really time consuming which left me with not being at work a lot meaning I was not making as much money as I was before the process happened. My ex wife tried to get the house and she also tried to get the full 200k + she wanted over half of the 900$ grant. Leaving me with only the money that is in my checking account  which would have been around 60k. I already made it known to almost everybody that there was 2 things my ex wife would not be getting which was the house and any money out of my grant. I also mentioned that I do not mind spitting the money I have in my checking account 50/50.  But my ex wife did not want 3k she wanted my 200k. At 1st her lawyer tried to throw in my face how she sat at home all day cleaning and cooking. I explained that she never cooked and the only thing she cleaned was the guest bathroom and it would take her weeks just to clean that. 

After fighting for a few weeks the divorce was final and I left my ex wife with 1k and I let her keep the car she got in my name. Her family is beyond furious with me telling me that I was being selfish and I should have just let my wife take over the house at least. I explained to them that that was the house I grew up in and I am planning on getting the home redone.  Her mother yelled at me told me that I am a horrible person knowing that my ex wife depended on me for money and bills and that I could not just take the house &amp; all of money and not give my ex wife anything. She basically told me I owed my ex wife over 200k + a paid off house. I told her mother that only thing her daughter did once we married was give me a headache, leave the house a mess and spend my hard earned money. I told her mom that there was days after I worked both jobs and still had to come home and cook because she did not do anything. I also had to remind her mom that we did not have any kids so if there was not any kids in the home to look after then what was her daughter doing all day while I was working ? Her mother called me a bitch ass man and hung up the phone. My now ex wife is now texting and begging me for more money. I replied to one message saying “you could have walked away with 30k but you wanted to be greedy I can no longer help you” she started saying that she wants the 30k now but I already had my mind made up. So AITA?"

Here me out reddit. I think my sister made a post about this situation so I thought I can do so aswell. Sorry for any spelling errors

My little sister Kat ended her relationship with her now ex boyfriend a while ago because of how controlling he was and how he kept asking her for explicit photos. Obviously he did not like that one bit (which is understandable) and started sending her threatening messages about how he will make her love him whether she likes it or not. She tried to get a restraining order but due to the fact that he is studying abroad and that he didnt do anything to physically harm her, she wasnt able to.

Shes staying with me since i live closer to her university and her ex doesnt know where i live. I didnt know much about her ex until one of her friends gave me his instagram account. I then saw that even though he didnt look all like she described in my opinion he definitely had some money on him and was from a Christian family which is a great catch.

This is where I might be a bit of TA.

I decided to DM him and we talked for most of the day (Kat was out running errands for me) I asked him if he still liked Kat and he said that he was planning to win her back by proposing to her when he travels back for the holidays and that he had the ring and wedding dress ready but he cant get through to her. I said I understood and would help him to persuade Kat to meet up with him.

I waited until Kat got home and basically begged her to take him back. I told her all of the advantages of being with him such as paying off any future debts she'll have and that God brought them together for a reason. She basically lost it and started yelling at me for texting him saying that Im insane just like he is. I kind of got mad at that and said SHE sent her nudes to HIM like a whore which is another sin she commited (she is an atheist) and the only way to fix it is to get back together with him and convert back to the right path. She threw a bible at me and called me an religious asshole before locking herself in her room. She is now giving me the silent treatment.

I asked my friends about this and a few of my friends agreed with me thankfully but the rest say that I was the asshole and that I could have put her in real danger

AITA?"

My sister 19(f) is/was mother of nieces both 1year old(f) my sister is a single mom in collage her bd walked out on her once the girls was born. My sister had to drop out of collage so she could provide for the twins since the family did not want to help. I would help as much as I could.  The twins have always been very spoiled/ whiny babies I may say. They loved to be held, cuddled, kissed and when they wasn’t getting the attention they wanted they would scream and cry. You know typically baby stuff. My sister was handling this pretty well until the twins all of a sudden started to cry over every little thing. EX.*being put in their car seats, being put in the high chair, fighting their sleep, refusing bottles but crying because they want their bottle* typically baby stuff. 

My sister has also told us that both twins would start to wake up at the exact same time at night and just scream and cry. She said that she would change, feed and burp them but they would still cry. Only thing she could do to keep them from crying was to turn the vacuum cleaner on and leave it on. As soon as she shut it off the twins would scream and cry again. My sister was getting little to no sleep because of this. The twins even ended up syncing up their bowel movements. So when my sister was changing one twin the other twin would be screaming because she has poo on her bottom. Then once she starts changing the other twin the twin she already changed would start crying because she was not getting any attention. 

My sister mental health was already suffering badly from PPD and she had little to no help. Her bd moved to an entire different state started a new collage and met someone else. My sister waited until the twins took their nap packed their things up and drove them to the adoption center or w.e it is *idk the proper word for it also this part was a little confusing for me so bare with me* my sister explained to the desk lady her situation and told her she couldn’t do it anymore. She signed some papers and left the twins there. 

My sister does not seem sad about it she actually seems rather happy. Our grandfather called her weak telling her that she was suppose to push through it and the babies didn’t deserve that. My sister has been trying to ignore it. She tried explaining to our grandfather that she was not able to take care of them and they was really killing her slowly. Our grandfather called her worthless. My sister is now in shambles wondering if she did the right thing. So is she the ass hole. ?"

I won't go into too much detail of the relationship unless asked in comments, but the current situation now is he was invited to one of his best friends weddings and was one of the only people to not recieve a plus one. He hid the invitation from me for a month and I accidentally found it and was pretty upset. I asked if he would let them know I'd really like to go as we now have a baby on the way, and I have been mostly kept from his social circles due to his mostly private style of life. He said he mentioned it would be cool if I came, but wasn't a must and planned to go without me, and ( i GUESS not even tell me until it was around the corner?). I said I wanted to be prioritized a bit and asked if he would let them know it makes me uncomfortable if he goes without me because we have a baby on the way and everyone important to him besides his direct parents would attend. He refuses and states he is entirely comfortable attending without me and says it isn't authentic to himself to not go. This isnt the first wedding that I was not invited to either IN the same friend group. The week of the wedding is the week we are supposed to be able to tell the baby's gender ontop of it, and now I definitely have to work around him not being here because he wants to attend the appointments. Am I wrong for wanting to lash out about not being included AGAIN? When we are already in a rocky place relationship wise due to the baby being pretty unexpected and other issues?

uy5q5k_448,uy5q5k,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (28F) am pregnant with my first child, me and my partner (29F) are so excited, After a year with dealing with IVF and a few negative pregnancy tests two months ago we finally got the positive test we’ve been waiting for. Okay now here’s abit of background, my childhood wasn’t the best and it includes quite abit of trauma that I’m not exactly comfortable getting in to but my mother has been a single mom ever since I was 7/8 years old, it’s always been a struggle but I believe she tried her best whilst juggling three children now (45F and 26F) anyway she met my stepdad when I was 11 and they’ve been together ever since. My mother idolises him, she believes he saved us and we should be forever grateful but he isn’t a nice man, he’s very manipulative and I think that he’s emotionally abusive and has been to me especially, we do NOT get on in the slightest and it’s clear he doesn’t like me and never has. He has never really been the nicest but my mum has always stuck up for him since she sees no wrong in him. she lets him treat me like I’m garbage which led me to move in with my grandparents during my teenage years until I was able to move in to my own place. My mother doesn’t exactly have her priorities in the right place either but I won’t get in to that. Now here where the problem lies, ever since I told my mom I got pregnant she can’t stop talking about how her and my stepdad can’t wait to be grandparents and he bought my unborn baby a baby grow saying my grandma and grandad love me, I rang her up saying I appreciate the gift but the only grandad my baby will have is my partners Father, she got upset ranting about how rude and mean I was being towards my stepdad and how he has done a whole lot for me and to not let him be apart of my baby’s life was cruel, I proceeded to tell her he has been nothing but cruel to me since I was a child/teen and I do not feel comfortable giving him a grandfather title, it’s my baby and I refuse to let him be a big part of their life when he made mine miserable. My older sister is totally on my side but my little sister is siding with my mother saying I’m hurting his feeling and why can’t I just go with it. My mother is saying they will have nothing to do with us unless I change my mind but this is my choice, she is completely blinded by him and I’m afraid I’ll loose her forever if I don’t change my mind. My partner is completely on my side but says this is my choice and now I’m not so sure.

WIBTA if I don’t give him a title or should I just suck it up if it means I still get to keep in contact with my mom?"

I (31 M) doesn’t trust my girlfriend (29 F), we’ve been together for six years and not once had a pregnancy scare or any pregnancies at this point in our relationship. 
We always practice safe sex, I always use a condom even though my girlfriend says she’s on birth control. For the past year my girlfriend has been trying to get me to have unprotected sex with her since she’s on birth control, I trusted her but I wanted to be safe so I still used condoms even though she disapproved of me doing so. 

Six months ago I started working harder at my job so I could get a promotion I let my girlfriend know this and she said she was okay, I got the promotion. With this promotion I made a lot more money than I was making before and then my girlfriend started pushing towards the idea of us moving in together I told her I was not ready to move in together yet and to give me a little bit more time to think about it, I would like to talk more about moving into together closer to the ending of my lease and I told her that. Which made her very upset and started distancing herself from me and being less sexual with me. 
It didn’t always happen but anytime I try to initiate sex she would make up excuses why we couldn’t have sex or outright refuse. 
In the last couple months we haven’t really been having sex but two months ago she told me she was pregnant which I doubted and I wanted to take her make an appointment with her doctor, Planned Parenthood, or even go to the ER to confirm that she was pregnant she refused to do so and only sent me pictures of pregnancy test that she took by herself. 
I invited her over to take a test at my house so I can see it with my own eyes she refused to do so and got very angry at me and accused me of not believing her and why would she lie about being pregnant. 
She finally gave me a pregnancy confirmation from her OB but it didn’t have the conception date or how far along her pregnancy is. 
I asked her about that and she avoided answering the question whenever I contacted her OB office to see if I could get the information she took me off her emergency contact list and refused to give me permission so I have access to her medical records concerning the pregnancy. 

I would like to be a father and I really want to trust my girlfriend but her behavior seems really sketchy to me and she cannot give me any straight answers, she refuses to tell me when she has any prenatal appointment saying she’s okay with going to them by herself because they’re during the hours that I work. 
I do try to work with her so I can get time off of work so I can also participate in prenatal appointments, ultrasound, etc.  I would gladly participate in those but she’s not letting me. She also haven’t show me any ultrasound pictures yet using the excuse she doesn’t want me to post them on social media or let any friends and family know yet because she doesn’t want to announce the pregnancy just yet which I am okay with I would just like to see my child and help her in any way I can. 

I know she has to be at least 3 or more months pregnant based on how sparse our sex life has been but she keeps on insisting that we need to move in together but she won’t even give me the chance of helping with the pregnancy. I am getting sick of her and I am to the point where I am about to end things with her I just don’t want her to use her pregnancy against me and making me be the bad guy by breaking up with a pregnant woman.

Edit: You can get paternity test as early as nine weeks gestation with little risk to mom or baby, if she is pregnant I don’t have to wait until she gives birth to have a paternity test done."

I would like to be a father and I really want to trust my girlfriend but her behavior seems really sketchy to me and she cannot give me any straight answers, she refuses to tell me when she has any prenatal appointment saying she’s okay with going to them by herself because they’re during the hours that I work. 
I do try to work with her so I can get time off of work so I can also participate in prenatal appointments, ultrasound, etc.  I would gladly participate in those but she’s not letting me. She also haven’t show me any ultrasound pictures yet using the excuse she doesn’t want me to post them on social media or let any friends and family know yet because she doesn’t want to announce the pregnancy just yet which I am okay with I would just like to see my child and help her in any way I can. 

I know she has to be at least 3 or more months pregnant based on how sparse our sex life has been but she keeps on insisting that we need to move in together but she won’t even give me the chance of helping with the pregnancy. I am getting sick of her and I am to the point where I am about to end things with her I just don’t want her to use her pregnancy against me and making me be the bad guy by breaking up with a pregnant woman.

Edit: You can get paternity test as early as nine weeks gestation with little risk to mom or baby, if she is pregnant I don’t have to wait until she gives birth to have a paternity test done."

Not being able to get (p) has put a strain on her marriage and she’s been suffering from depression. I honestly felt that prayers had been answered and she had been blessed once again. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. Instead, she told me that ‘God’ spoke to her and told her I was going to give her a child. I was thrown for a loop. I was shocked. I was speechless. Sensing my apprehension, she asked me what I thought about being her (baby carrier). I told her no in the gentlest way possible, but I gave her reasons why.

One, I have my own kids to tend to. My youngest is just a month old. Secondly, this last pregnancy was hard on me physically. I had to have blood transfusions and all and I’m still not a hundred percent. Three, my husband’s father has just been diagnosed with cancer and my husband is taking it hard. We’re contemplating on moving them either closer to us or in with us soon. Furthermore, I discussed this with my husband (after the blow up) and he supports my decision.

You would think that she would understand, but no. She EXPLODED! She told me it was the least I could do for FLAUNTING my kids in her face! I literally kept any news about my babies to a minimum (shopping for clothes, decorating rooms, gender, general talk about my pregnancy etc.) to spare her feelings. I couldn’t even celebrate with her for my baby showers because I was trying to spare her feelings. I was accused of ROBBING her of her business. (We owned a hair and nail salon together. She asked me to buy her out so she could have money for IVF treatments which I did.) I tried to overlook her anger because I understood she was hurting. There were a lot of things she said that has made me look at her differently. I was called out of my name several times and threatened. It got to the point that her husband had to physically restrain her and drag her out of the house. She broke dishes and plates in her rage! Thankfully my kids weren’t home except the newborn, and she was upstairs asleep!

She and her husband showed up days later to our daughter’s birthday party and my husband turned them around at the door. Her husband/his best friend had the audacity to say that I was being a ‘b\*tch’ for not allowing them at the party. I honestly thought they wouldn’t show up gathering what happened days prior. My husband took it upon himself to disinvite them.

v5wn3l_531,v5wn3l,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"  

I’m a 44F with five kids, (twin boys who are 21, f16, f11, m9) I come from a large narcissistic family with my dad as the leader. I have seven other siblings that are just as narcissistic. My childhood was so rough that I went to live with my grandparents in middle school and never went back. Best decision ever. There's always been tension between my grandfather and father since he was a child. His mother died when he was six and my grandfather remarried when he was eleven. My grandmother had three kids of her own who were adopted by my grandfather. Plain and simple my father resented him for it. He felt as if he was trying to replace his mother and himself. Not the case. They even went to therapy but it was of no use. He was a troubled youth that was in and out of trouble all the time, disrespectful, verbally and physically abusive, and a thief among other severe actions that I won't elaborate on.

My father is my grandparents only living child now. He nearly ran my grandfather’s construction business into the ground ‘embezzling’ money, which forced my grandfather’s hand to repossess his business back, which hurt him because he’d never expected such a thing from his own child. This damaged their relationship. My father went on to take more money out of their personal accounts and even put them on the line for a mortgage for his home. I begged and pleaded for my grandfather to pursue charges. All he ever said was, ‘No one will ever prosper from greed.’ 

My grandparents came out of retirement in their seventies to bring the business back to life. It was a no brainer for me, I resigned from my job and moved back home to help them. They did the impossible and made the business a success once again, but in the same it practically took their lives. For the last five years, I’ve been caregiver and running the business along with my sons, ALONE, and it’s no easy feat but I’ve done it. Their Papa has taught them everything he knows, and they love it so much that their going to school, so they can be fully equipped to help me more with the business. 

Mind you my family hasn’t reached out barely at all. We see them on holidays if that. They didn’t even call when they knew my gp’s were in the hospital.  My grandmother was first to transition over. The moment word was delivered about my grandfather in the process of ‘transitioning’ that’s when my father found his ‘heart.’ He was here every day and in the same this is when the disrespect started. 

I was subjected to listening to my parents and siblings discuss what of my grandparents would be sold and taken, who would get what, while my grandfather was laying right there in bed as they discussed this! Most times I would get up and leave the room and go cry, when I should have been laughing, because I knew my grandparents had left them nothing. They have an irrevocable estate trust that’s solid and structured to a tee. Anyhow on the ‘last day’ my father had the audacity to tell me that he no longer needed my help at the company. That he would be taking back over.

I ignored him. Asked me when, did I plan on moving out, because he had offers on the home. A home that has been in our family for generations! I still ignored him! Then he told me I had thirty days to move out! My mother stated they were being fair so there was no need for my attitude! I lost it! I screamed to the top of my lungs that my grandparents hadn’t left them a dime so crawl back to the hole they’d crawled out of! The funeral is days away and I'm not looking forward to them being there since they've made it known, I wouldn't 'get away' with what I've done!"
v6e2pe_542,v6e2pe,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"AITA because I (26f) won't try to reconcile with my sister (30f) this time around?

So a few months back my 2yo son was playing with her 1,5yo son at our mothers home and took some toy cars from his hand and we repeatedly told my son not to do it but her son was keeping the cars close to him kind of 'hogging' them and eventhough there were more cars available in the next room they wanted the same ones because that's how little kids are sometimes. The problem was when her husband came from another room, who hadn't been in the situation at all but heard it, sat down next to them playing and then all of the sudden grabbed my sons arm hard, yanked the toy car from him and shouted at him to give the toy back and not to take it from his son. (Fun part was that my son didn't even take that car from his cousin but from the floor and had it first) Everyone just stared at her husband in stunned silence and my son was visibly shocked and a bit scared and just stood there staring until I told him to come to me and he curled up in my lap holding the arm my brother-in-law had grabbed and snuggled so deeply in my lap I was convinced he tried to go back to my uterus for safety. He does sit in my lap often and snuggles a lot but this time it felt different like he was searching for safety in my arms, which he of course found. My brother-in-law looked a bit shocked too at his response but I wasn't paying much attention to him at that point as I was furious at him and focused ln my son. My son did return to business as usual after a while and my sister and her family left soon after. My mother even commented on my brother-in-law grapping my sons arm after they left so I felt like I wasn't just being overly protective and that he did react more strongly than needed.

A few days later I saw my sister and all was well until she told me she would invite us back to their place if the husband didn't have a flu and I told her I'm not comfortable seeing him for a while before my feelings of the situation cool down. She said nothing and we parted our ways like usual.
Then came the evening and she sent me a long text asking me if I'm serious about not wanting to see her husband because he told my son not to grab their sons toys? I explained the situation as I saw it (didn't mention that our mother commented on it as well because I knew she would just get mad at her too) and told her I needed some time to be comfortable around him again. She then accused me of not being fair to her children either (she has 3) but when I said that I have never grabbed them and she could tell me when I wasn't being fair so I could learn from it (my son is my first so I'll take hints any day)  she didn't have any examples of those situations. She then told me I'm just trying to make her husband look like a monster who abuses kids even when I just told her how I saw it happening, like I did above here, I didn't even say it was violent just that the reaction was too strong and my son was visibly shaken from the incident and that upset me and that's why I need a break to cool myself down before I see him again. She told me that her husband has helped watch my kid too (I'm a single mom and they sometimes looked after my kid for an evening so I could have time for myself) and I'm being super petty and incredibly unfair and childish if I get upset because of one incident after everything they've done for me.

Side note we were closer than ever with my sister before this happened, I dropped her off and picked her up from the hospital after her knee surgery because her husband wasn't feeling up to it and my son and I stayed with them for a few weeks helping around the house so her husband could go to work and she spent some evenings at our house when they were having marital issues earlier this year and listened to everything she wanted to vent out. We saw each other atleast once a week with the little kids playing together. I have never been close to her husband and didn't even try as she might get jealous and I don't want to start any unnecessary drama.

She just kept repeating that I'm trying to make him seem like a monster and then she told me that if I don't want to see her husband then I am to have no contact with the whole family. I told her that it makes me really sad to hear she feels that way as all I asked for was a little time not seeing him, I never said I would never want to again, but she stood her ground saying I won't see any of them then. When I told her that it's her decision if she doesn't want to see me at all she told me that as long as I have a problem with her husband then I have a problem with her and our texting stopped there.

I cried that night and then I started thinking about how she told me I am being petty and unfair for not wanting to see her husband because of one incident after everything they've done for me and I realised she is doing the exact same thing to me that she is accusing me of and then I got angry at her for throwing away the relationship we had because I needed some time to cool my feelings and I stayed angry at her for a good while, I even told my mom she is a hypocritical bitch when my mom asked me about the situation, but I have since cooled down from the anger as we haven't talked in atleast two months now. The more I think about it the less I feel like apologising to her and now I just feel empty towards her and I don't know what to do anymore.
I do still feel sad because of how little I must mean to her if she always chooses her boyfriends/husbands before me.

We had a falling out before years ago when she had just the two older kids and I had none and we were drinking together and I told her about my dream to go to Australia with a working visa for a year and she told me if I go her kids wouldn't have an aunt anymore and I need to think about out grandmother who was getting old and might die while I was away (she did die of cancer a few years after this fight occured) and when I wouldn't give her the car keys to drive home because she was drunk she told me that I deserved my abusive ex and I gave her the keys. I immediately called her then husband and told him to make sure she doesn't drive tonight and he eventually convinced her to sleep in the car before driving in the morning. We didn't speak for about 6months after that and I can't remember how we got back on good terms, probably saw in some family gathering and worked out our issues little by little.

Sorry for the long rant but it felt good even writing this all down.

Am I the asshole?"

Then came the evening and she sent me a long text asking me if I'm serious about not wanting to see her husband because he told my son not to grab their sons toys? I explained the situation as I saw it (didn't mention that our mother commented on it as well because I knew she would just get mad at her too) and told her I needed some time to be comfortable around him again. She then accused me of not being fair to her children either (she has 3) but when I said that I have never grabbed them and she could tell me when I wasn't being fair so I could learn from it (my son is my first so I'll take hints any day)  she didn't have any examples of those situations. She then told me I'm just trying to make her husband look like a monster who abuses kids even when I just told her how I saw it happening, like I did above here, I didn't even say it was violent just that the reaction was too strong and my son was visibly shaken from the incident and that upset me and that's why I need a break to cool myself down before I see him again. She told me that her husband has helped watch my kid too (I'm a single mom and they sometimes looked after my kid for an evening so I could have time for myself) and I'm being super petty and incredibly unfair and childish if I get upset because of one incident after everything they've done for me.

Side note we were closer than ever with my sister before this happened, I dropped her off and picked her up from the hospital after her knee surgery because her husband wasn't feeling up to it and my son and I stayed with them for a few weeks helping around the house so her husband could go to work and she spent some evenings at our house when they were having marital issues earlier this year and listened to everything she wanted to vent out. We saw each other atleast once a week with the little kids playing together. I have never been close to her husband and didn't even try as she might get jealous and I don't want to start any unnecessary drama.

She just kept repeating that I'm trying to make him seem like a monster and then she told me that if I don't want to see her husband then I am to have no contact with the whole family. I told her that it makes me really sad to hear she feels that way as all I asked for was a little time not seeing him, I never said I would never want to again, but she stood her ground saying I won't see any of them then. When I told her that it's her decision if she doesn't want to see me at all she told me that as long as I have a problem with her husband then I have a problem with her and our texting stopped there.

I cried that night and then I started thinking about how she told me I am being petty and unfair for not wanting to see her husband because of one incident after everything they've done for me and I realised she is doing the exact same thing to me that she is accusing me of and then I got angry at her for throwing away the relationship we had because I needed some time to cool my feelings and I stayed angry at her for a good while, I even told my mom she is a hypocritical bitch when my mom asked me about the situation, but I have since cooled down from the anger as we haven't talked in atleast two months now. The more I think about it the less I feel like apologising to her and now I just feel empty towards her and I don't know what to do anymore.
I do still feel sad because of how little I must mean to her if she always chooses her boyfriends/husbands before me.

We had a falling out before years ago when she had just the two older kids and I had none and we were drinking together and I told her about my dream to go to Australia with a working visa for a year and she told me if I go her kids wouldn't have an aunt anymore and I need to think about out grandmother who was getting old and might die while I was away (she did die of cancer a few years after this fight occured) and when I wouldn't give her the car keys to drive home because she was drunk she told me that I deserved my abusive ex and I gave her the keys. I immediately called her then husband and told him to make sure she doesn't drive tonight and he eventually convinced her to sleep in the car before driving in the morning. We didn't speak for about 6months after that and I can't remember how we got back on good terms, probably saw in some family gathering and worked out our issues little by little.

Sorry for the long rant but it felt good even writing this all down.

Am I the asshole?"
v71sh0_549,v71sh0,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Okay...  My(26F) brother(23M) has 2 dogs, he's had them since they were puppies but does not fully care for them. I buy all the food, feed them..etc.... he does however clean up after them somethings though. But he has never taken them to the vet or groomer and always complains that they need to go. Well, my family and I are moving, so him and the dogs can no longer stay with us. I told him months in advance and he did nothing.

So, right before I moved I told him I would pay for the dogs to go to vet so they can be boarded while I move, as long as he pays me back. He agrees and I go ahead with it to the sum of $700.

Fast forward and he still has no place to live and no idea what to do with the dogs and still has not paid me back for the vet and boarding. I assume thinking he can still live with me but he cannot and I told him that. So, I start helping look for places but he won't help at all. He wont look at houses, apartments, rooms, nothing and the dogs are stuck boarded since they can not come stay at my house.  This has been going on for a few days now and it finally blew up.

I found a decent apartment that he can afford, barley but can and they will allow the dogs. But refused to look at an apartment and get his documents together. So, I became angry and yelled at him for acting like a child and refusing to deal with his problems, in response he yelled and then threw some items and made a mess. I told him I am done helping him since he will not help me. I will have to find somewhere for the dogs to go, meaning a shelter.

I already put out so much money and I cannot keep paying for boarding and I have no where to put them.. So AITA if I rehome my brothers dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I contacted the vet that they were being boarded at and told them what is going on. They will be rehoming them and taking care of them from now on. I dropped off all the food I had for them and said good bye. The vet thinks they will be easy to rehome because they are pretty, health and UpToDate on everything. So here is to them a happy new start with a better family. 

And thank you all for the comments and information! I appreciate it. "

When she got back she said that she'd like to maybe try it out as she thinks it would be fun and we could use the money. I instantly told her that I don't like that idea as I'm possessive about her.

v8u094_597,v8u094,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"I know the title sounds bad, but bare with me. I (22f) and my guy best friend “Jace” (23m) have been friends since childhood. Our have parents dated on and off(and still do), causing us to grow up together. I have always, I repeat ALWAYS seen Jace as nothing more but a brother.

Now on to the issue. Jace met his gf “Kate”(21f) in college. He’s head over heels in love with this girl. She’s all he talks about, and I’ve never seen him this happy before. Honestly, it warms my heart seeing him like this, and I can’t help but smile every time I see them together. The problem is, Kate has major trust issues(she was cheated on in her previous relationship, and from what I’ve heard it took her years to start dating again). When Jace and Kate first started dating, Kate texted me a list of rules  I had to abide by while they were together:

1. No physical contact except for high fives and fist bumps 

2.No hang outs/visits unless she was also present(it didn’t matter if we were in a group of friends, she had to be there)

3. He wasn’t allowed at my place or on my property, even for parties/holidays

4.I was not allowed to like or comment on any of his social media posts

5. I wasn’t allowed to text him unless I ran it by Kate first

6. All of our phone calls had to be recorded on a secondary device and sent to her

There’s a whole lot more, but this is all I can recall at the moment. I was hesitant at following any of these rules, but seeing how happy Jace was, I sucked it up and went through with them.

Like I previously mentioned, Jace and I’s parents(my mother, his father)are a on and off couple, and have been for many years. Well, they finally decided to tie the knot. Our parents hosted a small get together with Jace, Kate, My partner and I, and the rest of our immediate family to announce it. Everyone was overjoyed at the news. After the initial announcement my mother asked me if I could do them a big favor and let them use my backyard as a venue. I of course agreed, and this is when the issue started. Kate spoke up and said that the wedding couldn’t be on my property because Jace and her wouldn’t be able to attend. When she was questioned by everyone and wouldn’t admit why, I told our families about the list of rules she sent, and how she wouldn’t allow him on my property. Everyone went quiet and she was red in the face. Apparently Jace had no idea about this list, and neither did anyone else. After a long silence, she replied with “Sorry but she’s(pointing at me) clearly has feelings for Jace and I’m not letting her take him from me”. I told her to get the hell over herself and Jace isn’t going to miss his fathers wedding because of her insecurities. It turned into a screaming match and now everyone’s blaming me and saying I should have never told anyone about the list of rules she sent. So AITA?

Update: 

Good Morning!(or evening)

First I wanted to clear up a few things. When Kate told me about these rules, she had also said that Jace was following them as well(she said that he would have also to run it by her before texting me, he was also recording the phone calls, etc..) Now I know that He was never made aware of the rules. 

Second, I was the only person who was ever sent this list of rules. None of his co workers, relatives, nor friends were sent this list.

Third, when I said that everyone(mainly my mom’s side of the family)is blaming me, they’re blaming me for starting the screaming match and ruining my mother’s announcement. Almost everyone is saying that I should have spoke to Kate in private if I had an issue with the list in the first place instead of blowing up on her infront of everyone. They’re saying this whole list thing should’ve stayed between us two and we should have sorted it out instead of involving family. 

Fourth, I’ve invited Jace over for brunch this upcoming Sunday(without Kate’s knowledge). I’m hoping it goes well.

Thank you for all your advice, I’m glad to know that I’m not the only one who thinks she’s psychotic.


Update 2: 

Sorry I took almost a week to update. I needed sometime to myself after everything that’s happened

Jace never showed up to the brunch we agreed to. I was a little disappointed that he no-showed without a warning but it’s fine(I’m assuming Kate has something to do with his absence). 

I’ve been spending time at Jace’s father’s house for the past few days(most of my moms family is still upset). I was hoping Jace would come home to speak to his father at least once, but he hasn’t at all. I’ve asked some of his family to reach out to him and see if come by his father’s house. Hopefully it’ll work out.

Honestly, I’m just concerned about our friendship. I don’t want to lose a lifelong friendship over Kate, but if he really wanted to continue our friendship, I don’t think he would be avoiding me or his family. Also, I feel like there’s something he’s hiding from me. He’s been so open about his feelings for our whole lives, and now he won’t even talk to me?

Anyways, I’ll update in a few days. I’m hoping he at least answers his relatives so we can figure out what’s going on."

Third, when I said that everyone(mainly my mom’s side of the family)is blaming me, they’re blaming me for starting the screaming match and ruining my mother’s announcement. Almost everyone is saying that I should have spoke to Kate in private if I had an issue with the list in the first place instead of blowing up on her infront of everyone. They’re saying this whole list thing should’ve stayed between us two and we should have sorted it out instead of involving family. 

Fourth, I’ve invited Jace over for brunch this upcoming Sunday(without Kate’s knowledge). I’m hoping it goes well.

Thank you for all your advice, I’m glad to know that I’m not the only one who thinks she’s psychotic.


Update 2: 

Sorry I took almost a week to update. I needed sometime to myself after everything that’s happened

Jace never showed up to the brunch we agreed to. I was a little disappointed that he no-showed without a warning but it’s fine(I’m assuming Kate has something to do with his absence). 

I’ve been spending time at Jace’s father’s house for the past few days(most of my moms family is still upset). I was hoping Jace would come home to speak to his father at least once, but he hasn’t at all. I’ve asked some of his family to reach out to him and see if come by his father’s house. Hopefully it’ll work out.

Honestly, I’m just concerned about our friendship. I don’t want to lose a lifelong friendship over Kate, but if he really wanted to continue our friendship, I don’t think he would be avoiding me or his family. Also, I feel like there’s something he’s hiding from me. He’s been so open about his feelings for our whole lives, and now he won’t even talk to me?

Anyways, I’ll update in a few days. I’m hoping he at least answers his relatives so we can figure out what’s going on."

My wife has been dating a guy for the last few months and she has already introduced them to the kids so I think it must be pretty serious. He had also been present for some of the community get-togethers in the last few months. Seeing that she had already introduced him to my children, I tried to be friendly with him.

He is a genial and candid guy. His conversational style is emotional, persuasive and lively and he has already become an entertainer in our circle as he is usually polite, sympathetic and sensitive.

Recently, one of our neighbors threw a house party (turning 50) and my ex was there along with boyfriend. Things went well until perhaps he had a drink too many. He became uncharacteristically enthusiastic and spirited as he started engaging everyone. He would call out someone from the party and ask them of their stance on some specific political issue. He would listen to them with a smile and then proceed to explain &amp; expound on it. While most were entertained, a few – especially the ones called out were visibly uncomfortable with it.

Finally, he came to me and asked what I thought of polyandry. I shrugged and said that it worked for some and didn’t for others. He then asked me if I had ever tried it. When I replied in the negative, he looked at me incredulously and asked “not even a threesome?”. I merely shrugged and didn’t bother replying. Thankfully, he smiled and nodded to himself and went on to the next topic. I thought that it would be the end of it.

During the toast, he raised a glass and said “To sex-positivity and to all the poor maidens who were victims of dead bedrooms” and winked at my ex who blushed. At that point, I was triggered like hell. I should now mention that I knew of a peculiar fact about him. He is 35 years old but for some reason he doesn't have a driver's license. I knew of it because my ex had mentioned it casually once when she had to drive and pick him up.

So, I toasted, “To poor ladies with deadbeat boyfriends who can’t even drive”

I registered with somewhat sadistic pleasure his face growing red at the remark as he glared at my ex. The whole atmosphere became tainted and I decided to leave.

But I started feeling guilty. I realized that I shouldn't have insulted him like that. Heck, he could have even had a medical reason for that in which case my remark might have come as callous.

Later I received a message from my ex-wife that she never expected that I would be so childish and was extremely disappointed in me. I offered to apologize to him but she asked me to just leave them alone."

I'm shaking as I type this. I am a 19 F and I recently went to my 28 M brothers wedding. His 26 F wife is a sweet person. She never is mean and she's the type of person who will give at most ten dollars to a homeless person. I wore a simple purple dress with some grey heels. I didn't go all overboard with makeup either.

After I showed up to the wedding, I got out and made my way with my gift in hand to them. His wife, who we can call Jenny, looked at my dress with such a disgusted face and said that it wasn't my color and it made me look fat. My brother agreed with her. I was shock since me and her were pretty close.

I shook it off and just thought it was because of her having a bad morning.

As we get to the toasting and everything else, Jenny's MOM went and stood up and started to shame me and call me names in front of everyone. I was speechless.

Jenny's MOM is a heavy set women and doesn't have room to talk. I stood up as kindly as I could and smiled, I looked at Jenny's mom and said ""You don't have much room to talk. Did you get the wrong size? I can see your back rolls overfilling out the back.""

A bunch of gasps went around before Jenny's mom burst into tears. I left before my brother could say anything.

When  I woke up this morning, I had a bunch of missing calls, randoms texts, and even my brother saying he made his wife cry. He said he also never wanted nothing to do with me ever again.

So, Reddit, AITA for saying what I said to my sister-in-laws mom?"

In May my husband and i found out that we were pregnant and i was extremely happy and excited about making our dream come true and tried to surprise him ( i wanted to have a recording for memories but decided against it because i felt he wouldn’t be ok with it)but he had no reaction at all, just  said “ok”, no hugs, no kiss, just sat there and said “ok”. It honestly hurt but i tried to understand that he was probably shocked and i didn’t want to upset him so i tried to not let it show. 

He has always been critical of me before the pregnancy in regards of my inability to get a “proper” job ever since i began with my medical emergencies even when i have been applying through indeed or in person, and while i have gotten 2 jobs from them so far it doesn’t last because my health got in the way and had to quit. Unfortunately now I’m having worse luck finding a job that will take me or even call me at all; now he says I’m not trying hard enough, reminds me every day that the baby will be here soon and we’ve even resorted to selling everything we have to pay debts. I know its very hard for him as the sole bread winner, so i get his frustrations but what upsets me more is how he describes me to his parents (i don’t know what all he tells them as he usually steps away so I can’t hear their conversations) but recently my MIL hasn’t stop messaging me about getting a job, how i should lie about being pregnant or questioning me if I’m trying hard enough or even looking for a job. I got fed up and told her off about me trying and getting rejected, how her son gets angry and yells at me constantly about it, how no matter what inexpensive or free outing option i suggest we never go out (i only leave to go to the grocery shop), when i ask to see a show or movie he is always on his phone looking at youtube or news, how i have to beg for affection/intimacy and can’t even ask for snuggle time because “I’m too clingy and need to get used to the idea of all of that to be over once the baby is here as they will be my “snuggle buddy”, how i feel like a dog waiting to be played with just to be told “shoo fuck off”, and how everyone dismisses my fears about dying during childbirth as nonsense.

vdq83y_674,vdq83y,top-comment,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Me (39F) and my man (38M), have two sons (7yo, 1yo) have not spoken to my Mom and Step Dad in over 3 years. Backstory: she was abusive when I was a child, so I already didn’t feel comfortable leaving her alone with my child(ren). But this It started when I called to tell her I was pregnant before sharing it to social media. I was 30 at the time, and she plainly said “I thought you were on birth control. I’m not ready to be a Grandma.”. Then she made that clear, when our landlord threatened eviction because he wanted his buddy to rent the place after 4 years as tenants, so we were facing homelessness with a toddler (our credit sucked), so I begged her to stay with her until we found a place and she said “we don’t want you here.” 

Fine. We stayed in motels for around 8 months until I found an RV space for permanent residents. His buddy from work offered his RV, and we finally got out of moldy bug infested motel rooms, saved up and bought our own RV. Then my Mom called CPS on me because I refused to talk to her, and then my son didn’t want to when she called my Hubs one day. So I was investigated, drug tested, underwent a psych evaluation because I’ve long suffered depression/anxiety from the childhood abuse.

Now she wants to be a grandma after our second son was born. I’ve refused communication, she has not seen her only two grandchildren. My brother and his wife cannot have children, so this will be her only opportunity to have grandchildren. So AITAH for refusing her access to my kids after she’s blatantly refused to support us or them when they needed her love and support the most? I don’t care about my feelings, I’m used to being treated like that from her, just don’t want my kids to feel so worthless when they truly need help."

I was showing them off and my brothers friends acted like I was promoting the devil. My brother got mad at me for causing issues when I “knew they would get upset”. As we were walking home he randomly said that guys were treated worse than girls and guys should be allowed to hit girls if they feel like it. I was severely offended and asked why he thinks that, he said that it was just his opinion and I shouldn’t be upset. He then went on a rant about how girls are more sexist then boys so we really don’t need feminism. I asked him if he was ever told to not show a bra strap, never show your shoulders, wear long shorts, no distracting the boys, etc. When I mentioned the shoulders he gestured to my outfit and said “clearly you aren’t following that rule.

From the start, my dad forbid me to see him. My brother hated him &amp; my mom constantly said “don’t tell me anything I don’t want to be involved”. My family refused to meet him until we were together for 1.5 years. And after they met, told me he wasn’t welcomed @ the house &amp; they didn’t like him.

My fiancé is beyond amazing. Everything I could ever want &amp; dream of, he is. He supports my school, he is kind, loving, affectionate, smart, handsome, he is in school to be a PA but has a job that if he chose to stay at, could be a career. He has never disrespected my family, but over the last 3 years we have been together, my family has only met him 7x. 
Early may, my then boyfriend asked my dad for his blessing. My dad said no. Two weeks later, on our 3 year anniversary we got engaged. He planned this huge surprise engagement his dad from across the country even flew down to be there. 
Now me &amp; my fiancé have been talking about our future for Atleast 2 years. We just knew we wanted to be together forever. We also talked about the possibility of my family not supporting us, being at the wedding, kicking me out if we got engaged etc. We wanted to make sure we were ready for that step &amp; okay w/ consequences.

When he took me home, we told my family we got engaged &amp; they were furious. They expressed their disapproval &amp; we tried to express the last 3 years they did not want to get to know my fiancé or want me to share anything about him. To which my dad said, he doesn’t want to get to know him &amp; doesn’t want him at the house. My fiancé said he was sorry it had to be that way. We also mentioned that when I graduate nursing school next year, I will be moving out. There wasn’t much to be said, they didn’t want to know anything &amp; said they wanted to be happy for us, but weren’t.

vf1ph0_700,vf1ph0,top-comment,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"I (33F) am a mother of 3 kids. I have 2 boys (5 &amp; 8) and 1 girl (14). For background information, my daughter has came out as Bisexual 2 years ago and a trans male a few mother ago. I have supported her through her sexuality as I see no reason she can't date who she wants to date. But I do not believe in Transgender nor do I understand. I refuse to see her as my son as it is unnatural. My daughter has also struggled with sh since she was 9 and I've asked her to talk to me about it but she refuses. She is currently 2 months clean, and I am very proud of her for that. 

Recently, her biological father, who is not in her life, has reached out to me. We spoke on facetime and he would like to see her. Mind you, her only memory of him is picking him up from jail, so I dislike this idea. As we are talking, my daughter walks into the room. I speak up, ""Hey (daughters name) do you wanna see your biological father."" I knew she wouldn't say yes as she has no reason for wanting to see a man like him.

She said no and I asked her to leave. I ended the conversation between me and her father. I went to her room and asked her what she was going to say before. She asked me for a binder.

Those things are unsafe and she doesn't need one. I denied her the item and walked away, but she called after me. She explained that she knew how to use it safely and that it would help with her chest dysphoria. She has no chest dysphoria and I guarantee that she will mis-use the binder. I told her no and that it was the end of that discussion.

The next morning she was walking around in sweat pants and a sports bra. If she really had chest dysphoria then she would try to hide her chest. I ignored it until i saw her brothers tackling her as a game. I called her over so we could talk in private. 

I asked her why she didn't have a shirt on, it's hot she said. I still wear a shirt even though it's hot so that's a fake excuse. I tell her that she needs to put a shirt on, she asks me why. I tell her it's because boys will be boys, specifically her brothers. They may be young but they might get the wrong idea. 

That's a stupid reason she says back, there's additute lacing her voice. I tell her to stop with the attitude and to go put on a shirt, I did not raise a whore. She looks at me and says in a taunting voice, ""If you think your 5 year old is going to hurt me then you did something very wrong"" 

I yell at her to go put a shirt on and if she was a real boy like she has been trying to convince me of then she wouldn't be flaunting off her chest.

She stares at me and in a cold voice tells me ""I'm not wearing a shirt as a preventative so I can't relapse. If I did have a relapse, you would be able to see. If I don't have a shirt on I can't hide it. I don’t plan on going out like this so I see no issue not wearing a shirt in the house.""

She turns around and starts to leave, as she's walking she says ""I do wanna see my dad.""

Now I feel bad, i didn't know that she was having thoughts of relapse. But I still won't let her see her father. It's been 3 days and she hasn't said a word to me. So AITAH?



Update: I took my child to family therapy and we have been mending our relationship. I still haven't allowed him to meet his father but we might get there eventually."

So I never got to see my parents or any family for the three years we have been married. I have actually not spent holidays with my family since 2011

We recently moved back to my home state of Delaware. We have yet to spend any holidays with my family. My in-laws are already planning to bring Ashely home for the holidays and her birthday.

Yet Ashely specifically told me “I was more than welcome to come but If I wanted to come I would have to pay my own way there and back. As well as food etc.”. 

I would just be the third wheel at this point. It blows my mind that she sees no issue with this. My family has always included her in everything. They believe that people who live together, are married, engaged etc. are a package deal. They have never left a persons significant other out. 

When I told Ashley that I was upset at the idea of her spending all the holidays and her birthday with them all she said was “I really miss my family and it’s not a big deal”. I brought up not wanting to spend them without her, her response is then come with me. I got mad and said “why? You won’t even spend any holidays with my family. I refuse to spend the Holliday or your birthday with them when you won’t do the same.” 

Clearly we have different views on this, it’s a big deal to me. She didn’t even ask what I thought of it, just that I have to accept it. I told Ashley I will not be spending the holidays with her family, not until she spends them with mine.

She even took their children to her boyfriends house while they were still together. Not separated, not fighting...living together with HIS parents.  
She got a house and car in the divorce - both repossessed because she didn't pay for them ruining his credit. Everything we own is because I busted my tail to get it.
We met a few months after the divorce, have been together ever since. She of course blamed me for them not working out. How can I be to blame, I didn't even know him????
Now on to some more of this lovely persons character...she slept with her best friend's husband for YEARS! She tried to destroy another marriage and when he chose his wife over her she claimed to be pregnant with twins. She even sent fake sonogram photos to his wife - said best friend.  Who did she blame for the affair? Her best friend, ""she never cooks or cleans for him"" ""she never takes care of her kids"" ALL lies btw.  
This person has done nothing but poison the kids against their father. Has he made mistakes yes. Is he prefect no. But he is a damn good father one that would do anything for his kids.

Update: Thank you all for your suggestions. I've always refused to say anything negative about his ex-wife or my ex-husband to our children. I do feel that at this time HE needs to say something.

vh7axt_728,vh7axt,top-comment,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,"My husband (41) was married to another woman who cheated on him. This woman had a baby while they were still married and even went so far as to tell people the reason the baby was so dark was because she had Indian in her. Nope she had the janitor from the nursing home in her. My husband signed the birth certificate and tried to pick up the broke pieces of their marriage. What did she do? She continued to cheat. She even took their children to her boyfriends house while they were still together. Not separated, not fighting...living together with HIS parents.  
She got a house and car in the divorce - both repossessed because she didn't pay for them ruining his credit. Everything we own is because I busted my tail to get it.
We met a few months after the divorce, have been together ever since. She of course blamed me for them not working out. How can I be to blame, I didn't even know him????
Now on to some more of this lovely persons character...she slept with her best friend's husband for YEARS! She tried to destroy another marriage and when he chose his wife over her she claimed to be pregnant with twins. She even sent fake sonogram photos to his wife - said best friend.  Who did she blame for the affair? Her best friend, ""she never cooks or cleans for him"" ""she never takes care of her kids"" ALL lies btw.  
This person has done nothing but poison the kids against their father. Has he made mistakes yes. Is he prefect no. But he is a damn good father one that would do anything for his kids. She uses my kids against him to their kids. ""He does everything for HER kids and not you."" BS we give the kids the same thing, the only difference is what my kids have is ALL they have. No two houses for them. No bedrooms with loads of stuff at grandparents. Everything they own is here.

UPDATE: thank you so much to everyone for all the replies, i enjoy seeing different points of view. thank you to everyone who replied. i have cut off contact, as i don’t trust them around my baby brother anymore. i hope everyone here has a great day!"

vin1qv_750,vin1qv,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So my parents got a divorce when I was 13. My dad moved into a mouldy little flat with me and my older brother until eventually he started dating a woman. We shall call her Mildred. So shortly after my dad and Mildred started dating they got engaged so me(15) and my brother(17) had to move into their 3 bedroom house with her and her 2 kids. (She had 3 but one eventually moved out). So she had 3 girls (13, mid 20s and late 20s). We will call the 13yo entitled brat, middle child blonde brat and the eldest rat. So my dad and Mildred shared the medium sized bedroom, entitled brat got the master bedroom with a double bed and Ensuite, my brother got the box room with a fold out single bed and I slept on a single lumpy mattress on the floor of entitled brats bedroom until they kicked me out of there and made me sleep on the living room floor. 

So it was clear that Mildred didn’t like me or my brother from the start. I would be extra helpful and do all the chores around the house and still she treated me like crap and said I didn’t do enough yet all entitled brat did was make a mess but she never got in trouble because she was a little princess. Things continued to be unfair throughout my time living there. I wasn’t allowed to call my boyfriend when I was there, I wasn’t allowed to take any of my belongings out of my suitcase on the floor next to my bed, I wasn’t allowed to sit on the sofa, I wasn’t allowed to say anything without fear of being yelled at, I had my phone taken away at night time, I wasn’t allowed friends over, I couldn’t have food or even water in the bedroom, I wasn’t allowed to use anything in the bathroom like the soaps unless I bought them or even watch the tv. These were all things entitled brat was allowed to do that I wasn’t. Things were even worse on family holidays. I wasn’t allowed to do anything I wanted to do, my boyfriend wasn’t allowed to come even though entitled brats was when I asked first, I even ended up sleeping on the floor on 3 separate holidays even though my dad paid for the entire things. Eventually I got so sick of it and moved to my mums house full time and apparently me being disobedient was part of why my dad broke up with Mildred even though I always did my best and followed all of those stupid rules. I ended up calling Mildred an asshole after they broke up and my dad punched through a glass window at me shattering glass everywhere. I wasn’t as mad that Mildred and all her kids treated me like crap but it was the fact that my once close father would treat me like shit too. It honestly broke me. So am itah for causing problems in their relationship causing them to call off the wedding and cut off my dad for a while?"

visfkz_758,visfkz,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"For some context I (34 F) am married to Luca (32 M). We have been together for 7 years. We recently got married. I have been the bread winner in the house all our relationship. I got him his own apartment after 6 months of us dating because he was having financial trouble. Me making the money is never something I would hold over his head. I don’t need him to have money I just need him to love me for me. 

I work in the military. My job is vary important to me because I have spent so much of my life working to get where I am. Luca does not work and we do not have children. I have never once asked him to do more them pick up the house. 

I am out of town and country a lot for work. I told Luca when he proposed that I work a lot and I may not be home all the time. I still pay all the bills and I payed off both our cars. I leave him with money when I know I will be gone. So it’s not like I am just leaving him to fend for himself. He has a car and money when I am gone. I am out out town a lot so we do not have the most sex. He brought up the idea of and open marriage. Although I am not the most comfortable with it I agreed. I understand that I can not meet all his needs. 

I had been gone for six months. When I came home he was with a woman but I had not told him I was not coming home so i understood. I waited downstairs in the living room till they finished. When they where done he came downstairs and saw me. He waved goodbye to his partner and that was that. He want upstairs and showered and I made us dinner. 

When he was clean I went to hug him. He pushed me away and told me he does not want me touching him. We pulled an envelope out of the kitchen drawer. 
Divorce papers. 
He said “I can not be in this one sided marriage you are always working and you ask to much of me when you are not here I do not love you anymore” 

I was shocked i got upset and maybe I was a little to mean 
I told him “you act like a needy child I’m sorry I can’t be down your
fucking throat all the time I’m out there working to support you. I don’t ask much of you. I just wanted you to love me. Get the fuck out of my house” 

He went on to tell me I was a bitch and that I can’t kick him out and that he has no  where to go. I left and stayed in a hotel. The next day I want him and gave him all the cash I had on me I took (500$) out at the ATM that morning , packed his shit and threw him out. I let him keep the car. 

In the end I told my friends and family and most of them said I was the asshole. They said I did not have to put him in the street. That I know he is not stable and that I should not have handled it that way.

I see that I should not have blown up on him but I was upset. 

So,AITAH for throwing out my husband?"
vjdic8_768,vjdic8,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"So before y’all judge by the title let me explain. I (19f) and my fiancé (20m) went to give my sister (17f) something at work. She works at a steak house and bought us a meal. She sat us with a nice waitress. The waitress herself was great and sweet. We didn’t have to wait forever for our food or any drink refills or anything. My sister had asked her manager if she could sit with us because they weren’t very busy at all (she’s a host). The manager said yes, asked her where she sat us and my sister showed her, and the manager waved at me and smiled. So I knew the answer was yes. When someone would walk in my sister would get up immediately to go greet and seat them. The manager was out there and knew she was doing her job while sitting with us. Before I start

Here’s some context:
My siblings and I (I have a 15y/o brother) grew up in a bad situation for most of mine and my sisters lives. I was 12 when things changed. We grew up with an addict mom &amp; an alcoholic step dad who was abusive with my aunt and uncle in a small 2b 1bt apartment. We would go hungry &amp; wait weeks at a time to eat besides our school meals during school time. We grew up poor and had nothing. I would try my best as an older sibling to protect them from the fighting and all the other things. I grew up being a very protective older sister

My sisters manager called her over after making the 8 pm cuts of the night. Our waiter was one of them. The manager asked my sister to ask our waiter or the other one she was talking to, to take an extra table. They were right beside us and very rudely our waitress said “I’ve already been cut so no” and that upset me. Like 20 mins prior my sister asked what type of tip we should leave her and I said she’s been great so we should do 20% which was 11$/55$meal. My sister was paying and agreed. I was just gonna tip 10% after how I heard her talk to my sister but when my sister walked away they were standing beside us still and started bad mouthing my sister. She knew from the get go that we were sisters. So why she would talking about my sister in front of me, I have no idea. But she did. When my sister came back to the table I told her I wouldn’t be leaving her any tip. My sister asked why and I didn’t tell her but she kept asking and I finally told her some but not all of it. My sister said that’s fine. My fiancé found a $1 bill they both suggested we leave it because it’s better than nothing. I didn’t agree but gave in anyways. 

After we left the waitress confronted my sister and said something about the 1$ tip and then managed to tell her how it’s against the rules to sit with family while on the clock. My sister was upset but didn’t blame me as I am very protective and she knew that. I still feel like the ah because she was confronted but at the same time it was out of line for the waitress to talk badly about my sister in front of me. So aita?

Edit: my sister works hard. She is one of 3 host. Everyone sits down with friends or family when they’re not busy. The manager doesn’t care. This is the first time my sisters ever done this. Also. The waitress said it in front of me. I’ve worked in the food industry as someone who makes 2.50$ because all my money would come from tips. And as i said at the beginning my sister was the one paying for the meal. I gave a tip and literally had 1$ in my name because of bills and gas. I gave all I had."

My older sister was 22 at the time my boyfriend was 18. Me and my boyfriend moved in together after a year of dating. We were both in college and busy a lot. I had to finish a project for one of my classes so i was out with my project partner late. When i got home i found my older sister sleeping with my boyfriend. I blew up at both of them, i was mean with what i said and i do regret some of it but they should have known better. I got my stuff and left. 

My family has always favored my older sister over me ever since we were little i think this is because i was adopted by them when i was 3 months old. They are my god patents my mother got really sick after she gave birth. She passed and i was past around my family members till they found somewhere more permanent for me they did not want to take care of a newborn. So them my god parents adopted me. i call them mom and dad since they are all i have ever really had. 

So when i went to my parents house crying and i told them what happened. They tried to tell me i was overreacting and that my sister just wanted to be more like me. I was pisses so i left and stayed with a friend for 2 weeks still going to school. 

My patents asked me to come over and they had my sister and my ex in the living room. i sat down out of respect for my parents. My sister stared with some bullshit i'm sorry and that she loves him and wants to have a family with him. I stared crying and yelling and i admit i could have handles that better but i was 20 hearing the man i'm in love with is going to be with my sister forever. After i got into the fight with my sister my parents were upset with me for not accepting them and i was called selfish. They said that when i want to be a good sister then i should talk to them, and to get out. 

 So i left, I had two years left of schooling so i got an apartment and finished out school. When i was done with school i join a marine biology program in Cosat Rica. Mind you my family has not talk to me this far. I decided i had nothing back home after a couple months. I want back home sold all my stuff my lease was up anyways so i got a permanent position down here and i moved. It had been 4 years since. 

I called my sister and apologized for some of the things i said. I told here i cant forgive her. I would like to say that i am not mad that he picked she i'm mad she picked him. My big sister saw how much i loved him and still wanted with him. I am not mad anymore but i cant not have the same relationship I had with her. Me and her talk every now and then. Three weeks ago she asked for my new address so i sent it to her. That when she realized i was not in the country. 

She asked me what the hell i was doing in Costa Rica and i told her live here she never asked where i lived till now and she did not want to know so she could come see me she wanted to know so she could send me a wedding invitation. The wedding she is having with my ex. She told my parents and they called me for the first time in 7 years to yell at me for not telling them i had moved. I told them i had nothing back home and that i have a life and a family here. it had been 7 yeas and I was done fighting with them.

vksvna_783,vksvna,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I'm (M 30) married to my beautiful wife Julia (F 29). I would like to say I am an artist. I do not make the most money. I have some income but it is not a lot. My wife is the breadwinner. She would never hold this over my head. I worked before the pandemic hit. I got laid off and my wife was the only one working. She was taking care of rent and all the bills. She has always made more money even before I was laid off. I took a break from art while I was working. Art is my passion but it does not pay bills. While I was not working my wife told me I should get back into art. I have started to draw and paint again. My wife tells me she sees how happy it makes me. I can work now but my wife told me I do not have to if I do not want to. She told me I should sell my art and focus on that. I love her for this. She has always supported me completely when it comes to working. She sat me down and had a talk with me when I came to her about working again after the pandemic. She said ""I see how happy art makes you and if you do not want to work and go back to art full time i would not mind that it is completely up to you i don't mind paying the bills if you're happy"" She is truly amazing. So I started art full time and I sell my artwork and I'm very happy with my life. I do not mind that she pays the bills I offer to help out all the time. She told me I can help if I want but I do not have to. I pay our phone bill, internet bill and trash bill. I know it's not a lot but I do not want her to feel like I am just using her. So I help where I can.

The other night we went out to dinner with some friend and family. They do not know i am a full time artist. My family has never been the the most supportive of it. when the bill came at dinner we split it by couple. My wife took the bill and paid. My friend said something about how i was making her pay for the food. My wife told him that she did not mind paying for the bill. Then the comment about me being a ""house husband"" came up and it irritated me. I told them that I have been working on art and that i have not made lots of sells this month. Then my friends started to talk about how that is not how a relationship is supposed to go and i need to man up. I did not care about those comments. What I cared about was that my friend told my wife ""You need a real man not a baby to take care of"" I know it was a joke but it hurt and pissed me off. The worst part was when my mom told me i need to start working and that i can't only rely on her for the rest of my life. My wife paid and we left.

When we got home my wife told me that she would prefer to pay all the bills then me work a 9-5 for the rest of my life and be miserable. I cut contact with them because I feel like one I don't need that bullshit in my life and two I don't feel like it's their place to talk about my relationship. I confided in my sister and she told me I was AH and that I need to listen to my mom but I'm 30 married and have a bad ass wife who can handle her shit. I don't see anything wrong with me working on my art if it goes nowhere I'll start working again.

Maybe my mom was right, maybe I should be more independent. So AITAH  for cutting off contact with my friends and some family after they committed my wife's and mine relationship?"
vlinu3_789,vlinu3,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"So I (female), and my boyfriend (who we will call B) have been dating for awhile now and we’re not exactly the shyest couple when behind closed doors… both he and I are comfortable with many numbers of things of which I will not get too into detail with; however, there’s been an issue more recently. Before meeting B I had never given head before but after a few weeks of him asking (not forcefully but somewhat persistently) I finally caved and tried it. I don’t mind it too much but it’s not my favorite thing to do. nearly every time we’re alone together at his house that’s all he wants to do while the only thing he does in return for me is use his hands. I also have helped him get off using my hands as well so I’m still doing more for him than he is me. I’ve asked him about this and voiced my feelings about it and he just says he doesn’t want to- and I’m not going to force him to do something he doesn’t want to do. Fast forward to the last time we were alone together being yesterday evening at my place- we started making out and he tried to initiate me going down on him to which I refused. He didn’t push the matter nor did he get upset, he just asked why in a slight pouty voice and then dropped it when I said I just didn’t want to; however, he then proceeded to stop getting into it at all- refusing to touch me at all unless I physically moved his hand and being (to put it bluntly) boring while continuing to make out which I then stopped. I asked him this morning if he was upset by me refusing him last to which he responded no but had no excuse as to why he was acting weird after the fact and then proceeded to say “I just don’t understand why last night was any different from all the other times you’ve done it” and then I told him that I would never pressure him into doing something he didn’t want to do or was uncomfortable with, but that’s essentially what he did to me without even trying to when he asked me to do that. He then confessed that he was just nervous as he had never gone down on a girl before- to which I then said I understood as I had never gone down on a guy before him saying “it’s okay im not expecting you to be perfect, you only have to try it once and if you don’t want to ever again that’s okay” which is the exact same thing he said to me before my first time. He then blew up at me and said he doesn’t want to do it and I needed to “stop being so selfish”… I don’t see how im being selfish when I don’t necessarily like going down on him- I just do it to please him- and thought I deserved something in return at least once for all of my services to him. So would I be the asshole for refusing to give him head until he returned the favor?


Update: I showed him this and all the comments and he said “I mean I guess I’d be willing to try it like once but I doubt I’d like it so that’s gonna be it- and it’s not gonna be for awhile”"

and why is she getting mad at me if that’s our moms fault not mine. now everyone is telling me that i’m just jealous of my niece and that i should just let her. AITAH?"

I (24F) was taking a nap before working a graveyard shift when my boyfriend (32M) came into the bedroom to, (very rudely), wake me up while holding my apple watch. I looked at him panicked thinking there was an emergency when he placed the watch in my face and DEMANDED to know who these messages where from. The messages being from June 9th and these events taking place yesterday June 26th. I read trough the messages to see that it was from a Facebook marketplace seller (FEMALE) I had planned to meet up with on my way to our babysitters home to pick up my purchase which I had told him about during the week it happened. Even though I explained to him what they were about HE DIDNT BELEIVE ME. His response was ""So if I call this number thats what she will tell me?"" Of course I got upset he would assume I lied to him (nothing like this has ever happened before and we have been together for over a year now) but I told him go ahead. He actually called the number TWICE but they did not answer. I was so mad that I had to prove myself to him, but I still went to my messenger app and showed him the original conversation about the sale and meet up. I asked him if he was happy now, got up from the bed needing to breathe because I have anxiety, and anger + rude awakening was a bad mix for me. I started to gather my things and told him I was going home to wear people trust me. He responded by being upset and stated I was being defensive. I told him he was stupid for being so damn insecure and acting like I was a Liar and a Cheater. He again said I was being defensive and walked away. True to my word I packed my things and my girls (4F and 2F [bio kids of mine not his]) and went home. 2hours late he realized I actually left and messaged me very mad because I got all defensive about a confrontation of my text messages and that I was being too defensive. I explained that I wasnt being defensive, that I am upset over his mistrust of me and needing PROOF of my explanation. He went on to say if I cant simpl respond to his questions for reassurance that maybe he should just be alone and I responded with Thats fine with me. Now we are officially broken up and asked me to throw away any of his belongings and to never come near his home. I still beleive it was wrong of him to respond the way he did but wondering if I was being an asshole and making a bigger deal of it than it was? After all I have nothing to hide and he has full access to my text/messages."

vnfepq_824,vnfepq,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Me (19F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been dating for a few months. Everything had been going great, I’ve met his family and he’s met mine. A few weeks ago I introduced him to my friends, so a few days ago he introduced me to his friends and it didn’t exactly go to plan. 

I’ve spoken to some of his friends online before and they all seemed super sweet. Apart from one. His girl best friend (let’s call her Emily) refused to talk to me online, I wasn’t sure why and whenever I asked my boyfriend he told me she was just busy and really did want to meet me. But something about it felt off. She was constantly messaging him when I was with him and trying to call him, he’d rarely answer right away because he wanted to spend time with me and not be on his phone. She was constantly asking if she could come over or if he could come see her, he would say no because he was with me and wanted to spend time with me, then she would get mad and wouldn’t talk to him. 

I figured she was just upset that she couldn’t see her friend as much as she was used to, which I understand. I was never the jealous type and always told myself I’d never be the type to dictate who my partner could be friends with. But a few days ago when I met his friends Emily completely ignored my existence, she spoke as if I wasn’t even there and was all over my boyfriend, grabbing his arm, trying to hold his hand and playing with his hair, at one point she even whispered in his ear. My boyfriend was aware she was making me uncomfortable but clearly didn’t know how to make me feel better, he would try to reassure me by holding my hand, kissing my forehead and trying to keep his distance from Emily. That was helping until Emily called him out on it. 

She pointed out that he was acting weird, that he wasn’t letting her near him and that I was the reason. That I was stealing him and that I’m a jealous bitch. My boyfriend tried telling her to shut up but that just fuelled her argument, she kept saying he’d never spoken to her like this until I showed up, that I was changing him. I told her I didn’t know what she was talking about, and how I’d tried making friends with her multiple times but she’d ignored me, that I was trying to become close with her like my boyfriend was, so that we could all be one big friend group. That I would never steal him or change him. She just kept shouting mean things and was ignoring everyone who said she was being dramatic. 

The last straw was when she looked me dead in the eye and said “I don’t see why he even cares about you that much, it’s not like it will last. You’re just his latest fuck and from what I hear you can’t say no.” For context she was referring to my last boyfriend, he was extremely abusive and would often force me to do things I wasn’t comfortable with, I’d never say no because I was scared what he would do to me. I’d mentioned it to one of my boyfriends other female friends and it must have made its way around the group. That when I started to cry. 

I turned to my boyfriend and told him I wouldn’t stay with him if he stayed friends with her. That I couldn’t understand why he would even want to be friends with someone like her as she is clearly not a very nice person. That’s when everyone went quiet and just stared at my boyfriend. He said nothing and just lead me back to his car. He drove me home and wouldn’t say anything. Before he left he said he would text me later. 

Now my boyfriend has said he understands that Emily was completely out of line and he was furious that she would speak to me like she did. But that he was mad that I put him on the stop, in front of all his friends and that he didn’t want to end a ten year friendship. But that he doesn’t want me to be uncomfortable so he would distance himself from her. My older sister says he should drop her and that he shouldn’t want to be friends with someone who talks to a person the way she spoke to me. But my friends told me I’m being as asshole, that he’s just trying to be a good boyfriend as well as being a good friend, that he doesn’t want anyone to to get hurt. And that I should just drop it.

But I don’t know if I can’t stay with him if he stays friends with her, I don’t want to be around her and from what I’ve heard from his other friends she doesn’t plan on apologising. I don’t want to lose him but his reluctance to accept that she’s not a nice person is making me question not only his feelings for me but also his history with her. 

So AITAH?

Update.
…I posted this in the morning and in the last few hours everything has completely blown up. So I was distancing myself from him to try and just give him and myself some space to think, but he was blowing up my phone with messages all day. Saying he was still mad at me and didn’t know what to do about Emily. He’s mad and angry at her for what she said and doesn’t know how to forgive her (Like he’s the one who needs an apology from her?). His friends told me that Emily has been bitching about me and has flat out refused to try and apologise to me, saying that she didn’t do anything wrong, that she was only pointing out the truth and she didn’t understand why I was being so dramatic. 

So basically I went to his house and he told me that Emily had been obsessing over meeting me from the second we started dating, that she was constantly asking about me and if we were still dating, he’d confused it for her just being curious and eager to meet me. When he heard what she had been saying to me he was beyond mad but didn’t know how to react, if she had been any of his male friends he would’ve just punched them, but he’s never been good with words and didn’t know how to make her shut up. He said he understands why I’ve given him the ultimatum but he doesn’t know what to do. (I’m not sure if I believe him tho)

I apologised for putting him on the spot and embarrassing him in front of his friends, but I pointed out that Emily had repeatedly embarrassed me in front of his friends and for some reason not a single person tried to stop her. I told him that I felt bad for putting him on the spot but there would be no changing my mind, me or Emily? He said nothing. So I got up and left. 

He’s been calling me nonstop for the last ten minutes, shall keep you updated."

AITA???

EDIT: I talked to my father about his behavior. and i gave him an ultimatum. either he loses me, or his wife because i will not endure this anymore. he started crying saying that he thought having a woman in my life for a role model was a good idea but all it did was hurt us more. he is now filing for a divorce unless she changes her attitude really quick."
voclpn_842,voclpn,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,"I (24F) was in an extremely abusive relationship that ended about 3 years ago. When i first met my ex I had just turned 18 he was 34. He was kind and charming for the first couple of months which instantly made me fall for him. My parents were not fond of him &amp; did almost everything to break us up. Due to the constant ""nagging"" from them I decided to leave my parents &amp; move out on my own. This is when my ex showed signs of abuse, claiming I was a whore for moving out by myself &amp; not with him. (He lived with his mom &amp; brother) he also has 3 kids. 2 baby mamas. The oldest doest come near his family but his 2 youngers ones he shares custody. 

Anyway, for the next 2  almost 3 years it was non stop physical &amp; emotional abuse. He drank beer all day evey day so needless to say he was almost always drunk. I could not go anywhere myslef,  could not have male or female friends.
- he would come to my college class..i eneded dropping ouy
- i dropped the gym bc he was always there.. if i went to the restoom i was being timed &amp; if i took too long he would send a women to come get me.
 I lost my job bc he kept coming over to check if i was there if h3 could not come he would call my boss!!!!. I had to call him on break &amp; lunch. Or we would have a problem. He blackmailed me if i didn't give into him with sending my nudes to all my family. 

It's just so much that i cant fit it all in here. Those were minor things. He threatened me..chocked me &amp; yelled he was going to kill me &amp; couldn't wait to have my parents see my corpse tomorrow. And remember we lived in his moms house! His mom &amp; brother heard all of this i would yell for help but their excuse was it's none of their business. He has terrible anger issues. His mom would blame me for his actions saying i provoked him. 

Evrytime i tried to leave her would
- take my car keys,  remove somew stuff from my car so it could not turn on, barricaded all doors &amp; windows. He would hold me down until i was physically tired and gave in. I would be so tired i would end up falling asleep. 
I wanted to go to therapy. I couldn't bc you guessed it was always there listening to it all. I had no privacy. I tried to relase anger through paintings he would rip them apart bc that's not how he wants me to see the relationship.

I called the police multiple times &amp; i was always the bad guy from his family's perspective.  He would get off on probation. I would be granted a restraining order but when i would arrive to the house to get my belongings. He would trap me in. 

One day i was finally able to leave with ny stuff? How? His mom had guests over!!! He didnt dare come touch me..he did belittle me but idgaf i was free! 

Now, ive moved on. Still going to therapy. Taking the proper precautions. I have a great partner who respects me &amp; I him. 

I was told my ex has a new gf. I looked amd yep but shes 23 &amp; hes i think 38-40.
I want to tell her about all of his history. I wasnt the only one all of his exs underwent a similar experience. 
Would I be the asshole if i reached out to his new gf? 

I have proof videos, court hearings &amp; the restraining orders that expire next yr.  Plz help




💥UPDATE 💥: I have decided to let her know. However, thx to a comment it gave me a great idea. I made a fake account &amp; i sent her the county's public record on him. 28 cases in total!!! It has his name, case number, case status( a few are active) case type &amp; filling date. Sent it to her w/o any personal info of mine &amp; basically told her to tred carefully &amp; it is completely up to her if she stays. Hopefully she does choose herself.

voclpn_844,voclpn,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (24F) was in an extremely abusive relationship that ended about 3 years ago. When i first met my ex I had just turned 18 he was 34. He was kind and charming for the first couple of months which instantly made me fall for him. My parents were not fond of him &amp; did almost everything to break us up. Due to the constant ""nagging"" from them I decided to leave my parents &amp; move out on my own. This is when my ex showed signs of abuse, claiming I was a whore for moving out by myself &amp; not with him. (He lived with his mom &amp; brother) he also has 3 kids. 2 baby mamas. The oldest doest come near his family but his 2 youngers ones he shares custody. 

Anyway, for the next 2  almost 3 years it was non stop physical &amp; emotional abuse. He drank beer all day evey day so needless to say he was almost always drunk. I could not go anywhere myslef,  could not have male or female friends.
- he would come to my college class..i eneded dropping ouy
- i dropped the gym bc he was always there.. if i went to the restoom i was being timed &amp; if i took too long he would send a women to come get me.
 I lost my job bc he kept coming over to check if i was there if h3 could not come he would call my boss!!!!. I had to call him on break &amp; lunch. Or we would have a problem. He blackmailed me if i didn't give into him with sending my nudes to all my family. 

It's just so much that i cant fit it all in here. Those were minor things. He threatened me..chocked me &amp; yelled he was going to kill me &amp; couldn't wait to have my parents see my corpse tomorrow. And remember we lived in his moms house! His mom &amp; brother heard all of this i would yell for help but their excuse was it's none of their business. He has terrible anger issues. His mom would blame me for his actions saying i provoked him. 

Evrytime i tried to leave her would

vpdiy9_849,vpdiy9,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,So i am a female 19 my sister is female 15 she will be 16 in july. I already have 4 tattoos and i wasn’t allowed to get one at her age. My parents have let up on my siblings strictness because i left of how bad it was. anyway getting to the story my sister is allowed to get a tattoo when she turns 16. I have been wanting a medusa tattoo for awhile but i’m going to make it a while disney piece where i’m going to also have maleficent in the back of my thigh and medusa in the front. I was s/a and medusa means women empowerment and i believe it is a symbol for anyone who was s/a. Anyway my artist has been sketching this piece for almost 6 months now because I want it to be perfect this is my first reallly big piece and im so excited for every little detail. My sister also wants a medusa tattoo but in the same spot but she’s not getting it as big or as a whole piece. She was s/a in 2019 mine was when i was 13 so that would’ve been 2007/8 if i’m correct. i just didn’t have the help or support of my parents i didn’t get therapy and they didn’t believe me i had to go through it on my own so this tattoo means the world to me. Now my sister is claiming “i’m not her family anymore” because she claims she had the idea before me. When i trued to explain i wanted this for awhile she said it’s only because she wants it that I want it. She also says that she doesn’t care that other people get it only me. Am i the a hole if i still get the tattoo?

vpyd8l_857,vpyd8l,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Am I the asshole?

My  partner (48m)and I(44f) met at work. We keep our relationship very private at work, barely anyone knows we are together (we do not live together)
My partner has shown a jealous streak when I am dealing with male members of staff (i am senior management) or male visitors to my workplace. We have clashed on this in the past and I have consciously changed the way I interact with people to minimise my partners 'green eyed monster' as we call it.
Things came to a head last weekend. We had a colleague who left our workplace. The colleague and I had worked together for 17 years. Upon his last day he asked to speak to me, I didn't invite him into my office as I knew my partners reaction would be negative so instead I spoke with him at the front reception area of our workplace in full view of anyone who happened to be near. During our conversation my colleague became upset and asked for a hug. (I actively discourage physical contact and find it uncomfortable woth anyone except my partner or family) I hesitantly agreed as my colleague was visibly upset and moved away as soon as possible.
Unbeknownst to me my partner witnessed this and was furious. He proceeded to 'blank me' for the weekend despite my sending texts and trying to call him. He has done this a few times before so I knew I had done something wrong.
It was my birthday on the Monday after this weekend. My partner sent me a text in the morning saying 'happy birthday. x' He rang later in the day but I was upset so didn't answer. He then followed up with a text to say 'do you want me to come over so you can explain yourself or are you not bothered'
I was angry so I said that I want explain anything and he could do what he liked.
So basically he has then ignored me for the week. When I've tried to address things with him he's either ignored me or told me that it was my fault for 'intimately hugging' someone.
Please can someone tell me if I'm the bad guy or if this person is gaslighting me??"

I run over and she’d been holding the sparkler too high up. She burnt the inner part of her second knuckle on her pointer finger. I was livid went off on my husband in front of everyone telling him how angry I was that he wasn’t paying attention and calling him a fucking idiot. Our daughter is ok (thank goodness).

vrla44_880,vrla44,op-engaged,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,We called CPS on a family member. Our concern started when she was pregnant. She was constantly lifting heavy things that she should not have been. Fast forward and the baby was born. When the baby was a newborn we often saw her giving him no head support and carrying him around like a sack of potatoes. At one point I brought to her attention that he was about to fall over and get hurt. She said “he has to learn somehow and it’s funny when he gets hurt.” He proceeded to fall over and injure himself and she sat on her phone and did nothing. She also was posting photos of him with whipped cream all over his face and saying he “got into her hot chocolate” at a few months old. we also witnessed her allowing him to eat fruit (not baby food fruit) at a few months old and she also would put fruit roll up on her finger and let him eat that. There was also other incidents as well. However the final straw was when the baby was 6 months old he was crawling towards something they didn’t want him playing with. She walked over yanked him up by one arm and Carried him dangling by one arm across the room then sat him down. He was 10 feet away and not in immediate danger. I said it was a little rough she replied with “if your going to tell me how to parent I’m going to do whatever the fuck I want to your child” my husband and I left and called cps because we were very disturbed. They have gone around telling everyone that we tried to take their child and that we called because we got in a fight with them. Are we the Assholes here because we are being made to tip toe around spending time with the rest of the family due to their feelings towards us….

vrzvzu_895,vrzvzu,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"This is stupid. I (29f) woke up early this morning. I told my husband (30m) that I was going to the store to buy dog food/pet supplies. He says wait, he will get up at 8:25 when his alarm goes off and go with me. We are both off work today. I said fine. I went into the living room to watch TV and got into a show, and it was 9AM before i knew it. 
I went back and checked, he was awake but not moving to get up. I told him I was ready to go, and he said ok. I left the room and picked up the house for a few minutes and he still was not out of bed. I went back in at 9:20 and said I'm leaving in 2 minutes so hurry up. After a few minutes I had had enough and got the keys and left. He called me, angry. He said he was up and ready 20 seconds after I left the house and I should have waited in the car for him. 

This is so petty and dumb. I told him over and over to get ready. Even now, as I am at the store sitting in the parking lot, he is texting me saying all I had to do was wait 5 minutes in the car and we could have gone together. 

I feel bad because he is angry but I don't think he should be. Aitah?

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. I took a few of your points and told him he couldn't do this type of thing anymore. To clarify, we have been married over 6 years and dated a few years before that. I'm not going to leave him over this, I was just very frustrated and wanted another opinion to make sure I wasn't also in the wrong. He has done similar things in the past, which is something I also brought up when I essentially told him off. He did apologize and agreed it was childish. I appreciate all of your help!"

2) She doesn’t want her husband(37M) (also my other best friend)to miss work because they need all the money they can get before the baby comes.
3) has been many health issues in her immediate family so they are unable to take her.
4) they gave me a place to live when I didn’t have another place to go so I will help them out in any way that I can

So down to the problem I told my ex(27F) (also baby momma) that I was going to be taking my friend to the appointment so I wouldn’t be by to spend time with my sons until after. 
She proceeded to go off on me saying that I didn’t even go with her to all of her appointments, even though the only ones I missed were the few blood test appointments and a few ultrasounds early on when the doctors didn’t want anyone else there due to the pandemic. 

Then proceeded to call me a weirdo and that I care about my friends more than my sons. Which is not true I see and spend time with my sons every day, I go over right after work every day and spend most of my free time with them on my days off. 

Edit : I am not going into the appointment with her, just dropping her off and picking her up.

So AITA for offering to take my friend to her doctors appointment?

But anyways, we and my daughter Abigail(3f) went to Florida to visit for the first time ever.(she has always came to us.) When we get there, she greets him with a kiss, on the lips. Aside it wasn’t weird enough if it assent a peck, it was still on tough and saliva. He was basically making out with her. I acted normal and planned to talk to him in private when we went to sleep. The night time comes and I can’t find him. I look through the house then go to find his mother. He is sleeping in her bed with his mother,(She sleeps naked). I start screaming and took my daughter and I to a hotel near by. When we got back to PA I sat him down and gave him divorce papers to sign. My friends are saying I’m being over dramatic. So am I?"

Little background on that : I suffer from different kinds of sicknesses and I am really scared that my baby will get any of those. So I try to not do anything risky especially when it could affect the baby.

So I asked my best friend if she could help me out by doing the litter boxes because I saw she was getting ready to go out drinking wine with one of our friends. She refused to do so and when I asked her why she said that she doesn’t have time. I reminded her of the risk I’m taking if I do it but she didn’t seem to care…

AITA for getting mad and telling her if the baby has toxoplasmosis it’s on her ?"

In Italy, I used to live with my mum and my grandma, and we've always been a poor family. We couldn't afford basic things like grocery shopping or health treatments, despite my mum's work. (She wastes money for silly things, without caring about the important ones)

As soon as I turned 18 I decided to start working to buy my own things and help my family, but I soon noticed that my mum was stealing my money to use it for unnecessary things, like shopping for expensive clothes, luxury food, expensive meals in big restaurants...
So I decided to save as much as possible, until I was able to leave Italy. I did it, I go to University in the morning and work in the afternoon/evening (I work in a office in the marketing field), and I earn a lot more than I did in Italy (In Italy, the monthly salary is around 1k€, while in Norway is around 5/6k).

My mum doesn't like this choice, she thinks that I'm selfish and I only care about money, while my grandma doesn't talk to me anymore. I told my mum that I will send her money for grocery shopping, health treatments and new clothes, but she refused and said that one day I will ""die of shame"" thinking about how I abandoned her.

I honestly just want the life of my dreams, I work hard to earn my money and pay for my studies and my life in Norway, and I'm not feeling like I abandoned her or left her in trouble. She's a grown adult (43) and she should be able to use her money wisely, without wasting them for silly things.

But some of my friends told me that I should pay everything for her, because she's my mother.. So I'm asking you, AITA?"

This week I’ve been here she’s had her boyfriend and his 2 brothers over. (They live in nyc so they don’t come over a lot) anyways I woke up around 9:00 I’m the morning and I wasn’t wearing a bra. I was just in a t shirt and some sweatpants. My aunt and her boyfriend along with his brothers were sitting in the living room in my grandparents house you have to walk through the living room to get to the kitchen so i obviously did that since I was thirsty and said good morning to everyone. After that I sat out on the couch for a bit and just talked about random shit. The entire time my aunt was giving me almost sort of death glares anyways once I went in my room about 20minutes later my aunt came into my room and she said “you really needed to cover up and put a bra on since your being too distracting and there’s guys out there and you could be making them distracted” this t shirt that I had on was pretty thick and you couldn’t see my nipples so I was really confused. I told her that this is our grandparents house and they didn’t care and that I was 14 and every man out there was a grown man. She got mad and stormed out and threw her little drama queen got to my grandparents as usual and they sided with me. I would’ve put a bra on but it was nine o’clock in the morning and my plan was just to get something to drink. I really don’t think I’m in the wrong one bit but I few of my friends say I am. So please tell me what you think. [edit] also I don’t wants some 40 year old man’s opinion or really any guys opinions at all. [another edit] I want to point out that my aunts bf and her brother were in no way staring at my chest or have ever done anything to make me uncomfortable and they are really nice ppl.

vwwzie_1041,vwwzie,top-comment,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"I know I might sound like TA right off the bat but hear me out. I (22M) am currently living with my (21F) gf of 2years. I seriously love her and I want to spend my life with her. She has always been here for me when I'm at my lowest or feeling the worst. I struggle with serious anxiety and depression which lead to panic attacks and although medicated I still deal with them frequently. Recently my gf has expressed an interest in becoming a stripper at a club near our apartment. She originally brought it up jokingly and I assumed she was truly joking as she and I are very monogamous and she disagrees with most forms of sex work. I laughed and told her that she's definitely sexy enough to work in one but that I would never let it happen because I want her to be with me every night. She looked at me confused and said she actually wanted to be a dancer. I was caught off guard as she has never once told me she wanted to dance. Let me say that I absolutely understand that it is a job and I do not consider you to be less of a person if you're a stripper. I acknowledge it
as a job but in nature it is a job where you make money showing off your body for the pleasure of others. In this case it's a club where women dance for men. I know
many couples with a sex worker who make it work and I'm genuinely happy for them. The reputation of men who attend this club is rather abhorrent and they frequently touch and ask girls to go home with them for a decent amount of money. I brought up that my coworkers go to this club almost every week and that I hear them talk about their private dances and I know they physically put money in the dancer's lingerie. She looked at me and asked me why it's bad if it's just a job and she wouldn't be doing it for the men. I looked rather shocked and told her that understand she wouldn't dance because she wants to get other men off but I told her that's what would happen. I told her that if she was a dancer I would feel like shit at home because I would be thinking about how other men (including my own coworkers) would be offering for her to go home with them and sneaking touches while putting money on her. She told me that I shouldn't worry because she wouldn't have any feelings for these men. She told me she just wanted to dance because it looks fun. I offered to install a pole in our apartment for her to dance. I offered her to give me the private dances yet she told me that the exciting part is having an audience. I was stunned as she makes fun of girls with OnlyFans accounts. She and I have talked about getting married and we are both incredibly jealous and protective of each other. I kept telling her that I don't want to be alone in our apartment when I come home from work. Our schedules would overlap leaving me by myself until I'm asleep. I said I would feel jealous and alone. She told me that I shouldn't feel that way. I ended up telling her that I simply couldn't handle that and it would feel too painful. I told her that if she became a stripper I would leave. She told me that I was being selfish and that if I leave then I never truly loved her. She's now mad and not talking to me. Am I the asshole?"

 Me: 16M, and my brother 14M like to play basketball. I happened to have got into the sport before he did, and practiced almost a full 4 hours a day, my brother practices half as much as I do. 

During the previous summers I couldn’t practice since I was busy working. I worked a full summer and a half to get a ball signed by Kobe Bryant (Rest in peace) that cost me $2500 to get. While I worked my ass off all summer my brother was practicing 2 hours a day like usual and I had to cut my practicing down to 2 hours a day as well. 

Now fast forward to about a month ago. My brother was using his practice time, he had been playing for about an hour. (Context: at the end of our driveway we have a two foot tall wall with a ten foot drop that leads down to he backyard, this also leads to a creek.) My brother shoots the ball and misses and it goes rolling down into the yard, no big deal. He just had to go and pick it up. He instead decided to use the ball I use to practice with and tried that. It also rolls down. 

So him being the lazy person he is, he go inside the house and uses my $2500 ball to go play basketball with, and you guessed it, it rolled straight into the creek (The other balls didn’t roll into the creek.) He freaked out and couldn’t find it and he knew I was going to be back home in about 20 minutes. So he grabs the other two balls and shoved them in my little brother hands (9M) and of course my youngest brother takes the blame and got punished by my parents. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my brothers punishment ended and although I couldn’t find the ball I was no longer angry but just frustrated. So my brother 14M goes to play on the trampoline with me and while doing so tells me what happened. I was so infuriated about what he did I pushed him and and he broke 2 toes on one foot, broke his collarbone, and sprained his wrist. I helped him inside and he went to Urgent care. I told my parents why and they still tried to make me pay the bill, (Edit: a portion of the bill) but I refused. 
AITA?

Update: based on the responses so far I have an idea of what to do. I will pay the bills but only if 1. my brother pays for my ball and 2. my brother gets punished for what happened with the youngest"

My BD (28M) left when our daughter (5F) was a month old, because he didn’t want to be around my family (parents, grandmother, etc.) while his family (parents, siblings, etc.) is in Arizona.

It’s been 5 years now, and in the past 3 years he’s had 2 other kids, I don’t know if it’s the same woman that’s not my need to know.

We only communicate when needed and that’s not very often. The last communication we had was about a month ago when he asked me for money and I flat out said ‘no’.

I have him on child support because I work a full time job to keep food in mine and my daughter belly and clothes on our backs. Which he hasn’t paid since 2018 totaling to about $14,500. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole:
After I said no to giving him money, I reminded him that he’s got 3 kids, and hasn’t paid child support in years. If anything I should be asking him for money, but I don’t. He accused me of being petty because he left and I hung up after telling him from now on not to communicate unless it’s my daughters birthday.

Am I the asshole?"

He taught me how to ride a bike and things like that. My mother trusted him, as did I. I never expected him to do what he did. One fateful fishing trip changed all that. After that I couldn't look at him, talk to him.. I might not have had a dad, but I knew they didn't do that. Well, if life isn't a bitch already lol... he ended up dating my blood related cousin and got her pregnant. I was crushed. I got the courage to call him and told him if he stays in his kids life I'd tell the world what he did to me. He jumped ship and ghosted his kid and has stayed away from everyone. His son is now coming up to 18 and is asking all sorts of questions and wondering why he left. Now that I have my own child I wonder if iatah for denying a child his dad. In my 11 year old mind.. I thought that was the best way to protect everyone involved. Even my rapist. This may sound stupid.. but.. it's been weighing on my mind heavily lately.

(Context) Two years ago, I (then 15 nonbinary) got a bad grade in the subject that my mother (then 47 f) taught. She wanted to find out what happened. I was crying so hard I could not explain anything. She insisted I get my science binder. She did not try to comfort me. She went through my room to find it. When she came back downstairs I could tell something was wrong. She had found a vent of mine that included suicidal ideation. Now it was old and I had mostly gotten over my suicidal feelings. 

I was very angry. My privacy is extremely important to me and I had expressed that I wanted no one in my room when I wasn’t there many times prior to this. My mom loved affection and because of this I had withdrawn any affection from her. My sister was at university and my dad wasn’t affectionate, so she got most of her affection from me. Unfortunately I am also someone who needs a lot of affection, so after a few hours, I started hugging her again. 

At this time, my mom and I regularly walked around the block after dinner. During this time we could talk without my father. She told me that when she was younger, my aunt (her sister) had read her diary. My mom had been sexually assaulted and her sister was able to help her from the information she got from her diary. She used this to explain why she didn’t feel bad about going into my room. She didn’t think it was wrong because she felt she deserved his information as my mother. She told me that I wanted to tell her I was suicidal.

She gave a very reluctant apology.

Over the past two years, every time I remember this, I cry for hours and the rage still burns. I don’t know why I can’t write about my own feelings in my room without someone feeling like I owe them to find out. I wonder: why can’t my own mother give me privacy? Why can’t I have my own space? 

Now my mother believes I don’t let her in my room because it is very messy. Proof being that she tried to look in when I cleaned it. 

I don’t tend to hold it against her in our regular interactions. I don’t trust her, though, and I never let her in my room. 

She has supported me on my transition as a trans person and overall she’s a nice person. Maybe that's the bare minimum but maybe it counts for something. 

Sometimes I feel bad for still not trusting her and still being angry over this. AITA?

Edit: thank you for those who gave positive/constructive comments I really appreciate it.

vzgm3z_1092,vzgm3z,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"I (20f) and my fiancé (21M) moved in with my in laws about 4 months ago. We moved in because we had just had our son and were struggling. About a week after my son was born my MIL(41) had given me a waist trainer wrap for recovery. So I had it about 7 months. After we moved in, about a month ago I noticed it went missing from my bedroom. I chalked it up to me being forgetful and misplacing it. 

I cleaned the bathroom and after dealing with the chemicals my hands were SUPER DRY. So I walked out of the bathroom and my SIL (23f) wasn’t home but her door was open. She has lotion right on the inside of her doorway. So I grabbed a pump and noticed my waist trainer was RIGHT NEXT TO THE LOTION. I was confused as hell and took it back, ya know cause it was mine. 

Let’s fast forward 2 WEEKS, I was at my moms house, which is across the street. All of a sudden my SIL comes to the door asking for it. I was asleep because I was up all night the prior night with food poisoning. She tells my mom to have me call her. I message her as say “ lmfao are you talking about the one your mom gave me?” Once I woke up. 

My MIL then calls me from SILs phone and starts yelling saying what I texted was disrespectful. I was so confused, I just asked a question. And then she started talking about how I wasn’t raised with common sense and I just hung up on her. 

I then decide to just go over and give her the stupid waist trainer if it’s gonna start a whole fight. After I walk in SIL is following me around the house yelling and when I handed it to her she SNATCHES it from me and it whips me.  MIL and SIL straight up LOCK AND BLOCK ME IN THE HOUSE REFUSING TO LET ME LEAVE. I just stand then as they both start sCREAMING and my blood starts to boil. I didn’t say anything to them accept “ Please let me leave” in the calmest voice possible. They refuse and continue to berate and insult me. SIL threatens me physically and I ignore it. She tells me I’m not WORTHY to go out the front door. MIL says I don’t love my fiancé because we get into arguments. She says I don’t love my son because I don’t hold him 24/7 and HAVE to set him down. She said a baby should never cry more than 10 seconds. 😐. My son is almost 8 months old. He’s okay to sit in his walker while I shit, I promise. Anyways, after she said I don’t love them I yelled in her face telling her to move. She ask why, I say because you’re both spewing bullshit from your mouths. I turn away from MIL and go to jump the fence because remember I’m not “worthy” to use the front door. SIL follows threatening me AGAIN. After I close the back door behind me, MIL RUNS, yes RUNS, to tell on me to my mom. 😐 

I use the front door after SIL threatens to pull me back by my ponytail. MIL then sits on my moms porch for 2 HOURS saying she basically hates me.  My mom just sat there like “🤨🫤 okay but like why” MIL just said I gave her “rude looks” and even admitted I never said anything rude to her. Yes, I give her rude looks when she tries to step in as my sons mom. She doesn’t know her place in his life and I have to constantly remind her of her place. It’s been life that since he was born. She only leaves when I say my fiancé has his own issues with her. 

Hours later I go to go home WITH my fiancé and son and I get “lectured” by FIL(41) for almost 4 hours saying I’m a bad mom and an awful person and then I get kicked out by MIL because she said she doesn’t feel safe sleeping with me across the house. I take my son and go to my moms at 12am. I had stayed there with her for a week. In that time I have blocked MIL FIL a and SIL on everything. MIL apparently tried calling me and saying she wanted us back at the house. This woman doubled down on hating me for 6 hours. Why would I go back? My fiancé slept there for the last week because there was no more room for the three of us. So just me and my son stayed with my mom. We had to wait a week in order to move our stuff into my parents rental house. I am writing this from MY bed. So am I the AH for taking back what was mine?

EDIT: My partner was by my side the whole time. His mom tried as hard as she could to turn him against me but she failed. He would only go to my in-laws to sleep because there was no room for him at my moms. We are no longer sleeping in different houses and he bows how fucked up the fight was. But he sided with me."
vzgm3z_1094,vzgm3z,top-comment,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"I (20f) and my fiancé (21M) moved in with my in laws about 4 months ago. We moved in because we had just had our son and were struggling. About a week after my son was born my MIL(41) had given me a waist trainer wrap for recovery. So I had it about 7 months. After we moved in, about a month ago I noticed it went missing from my bedroom. I chalked it up to me being forgetful and misplacing it. 

I cleaned the bathroom and after dealing with the chemicals my hands were SUPER DRY. So I walked out of the bathroom and my SIL (23f) wasn’t home but her door was open. She has lotion right on the inside of her doorway. So I grabbed a pump and noticed my waist trainer was RIGHT NEXT TO THE LOTION. I was confused as hell and took it back, ya know cause it was mine. 

Let’s fast forward 2 WEEKS, I was at my moms house, which is across the street. All of a sudden my SIL comes to the door asking for it. I was asleep because I was up all night the prior night with food poisoning. She tells my mom to have me call her. I message her as say “ lmfao are you talking about the one your mom gave me?” Once I woke up. 

My MIL then calls me from SILs phone and starts yelling saying what I texted was disrespectful. I was so confused, I just asked a question. And then she started talking about how I wasn’t raised with common sense and I just hung up on her. 

I then decide to just go over and give her the stupid waist trainer if it’s gonna start a whole fight. After I walk in SIL is following me around the house yelling and when I handed it to her she SNATCHES it from me and it whips me.  MIL and SIL straight up LOCK AND BLOCK ME IN THE HOUSE REFUSING TO LET ME LEAVE. I just stand then as they both start sCREAMING and my blood starts to boil. I didn’t say anything to them accept “ Please let me leave” in the calmest voice possible. They refuse and continue to berate and insult me. SIL threatens me physically and I ignore it. She tells me I’m not WORTHY to go out the front door. MIL says I don’t love my fiancé because we get into arguments. She says I don’t love my son because I don’t hold him 24/7 and HAVE to set him down. She said a baby should never cry more than 10 seconds. 😐. My son is almost 8 months old. He’s okay to sit in his walker while I shit, I promise. Anyways, after she said I don’t love them I yelled in her face telling her to move. She ask why, I say because you’re both spewing bullshit from your mouths. I turn away from MIL and go to jump the fence because remember I’m not “worthy” to use the front door. SIL follows threatening me AGAIN. After I close the back door behind me, MIL RUNS, yes RUNS, to tell on me to my mom. 😐 

I use the front door after SIL threatens to pull me back by my ponytail. MIL then sits on my moms porch for 2 HOURS saying she basically hates me.  My mom just sat there like “🤨🫤 okay but like why” MIL just said I gave her “rude looks” and even admitted I never said anything rude to her. Yes, I give her rude looks when she tries to step in as my sons mom. She doesn’t know her place in his life and I have to constantly remind her of her place. It’s been life that since he was born.

I thought that was over. Then fast forward to yesterday, he came over to my place and we were eating burgers and watching stranger things. We later ended up cuddling in my bed and things escalated from there. After that we showered and things happened again. He left a little bit later. Now to today, I thought everything was fine until when we’re calling and he mentioned it and said he was feeling insecure until we started getting hot and heavy and in his words “you were super tight which made me feel secure even though it hurt” so I was like “wait so are you saying you thought I was cheating until we slept together and you could tell because I was tight?” He responded “precisely”. I got mad and he admitted that he only thought that because sometimes I just hang up when I arrive at an appointment for a dog/cat service and I don’t want to make the owner uncomfortable so I just hang up without saying anything. I do text later when I can and say “i love you, I’m sorry I had to go I’ll call you back when I leave” but he felt like I was hiding something especially because I don’t say I love you before hanging up at those times specifically when I arrive at the pet owners home. So I just said, I love you and I don’t want to talk anymore and hung up as I was omw to a dog sitting thing I had. Now I’m here sitting with the dog and she can tell I’m mad because she keeps trying to cuddle with me to cheer me up. I’m just questioning the relationship right now cuz I feel like this won’t be the last time and the extreme insecurities is a dealbreaker. I literally share my locations and always tell him everything I’m doing even when I’m using the bathroom. I make jokes like that and honestly I just thought we were past it and I don’t want to spend more time stressing over something so stupid. So AITA?
EDIT: No he didn’t continue after I told him it hurt. He stopped and made sure I was comfortable. I was more comfortable once we took a shower and everything was fine. I did tell him that I believe he’s manipulating me even if he’s not intentionally doing it, it’s subconscious. I don’t exactly blame him in that aspect because his father is seriously problematic.

w16vjg_1121,w16vjg,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"First off, posting vulnerabilities is extremely difficult for me to do, so this will likely be short and lacking, but I can answer any specific questions to clarify more detail, if need be. 
My(38f) bf(30m) is the love of my life. I dated him back in college and things didn’t work out, but about 5 months ago he reached out and we rekindled our relationship. 
He swept me off my feet, yet again. He is great in so many ways, I can’t even begin to keep count. At the moment, we are long distance, but he’s come to see me about once a month and those moments are near perfect.  He’s been talking to me about me moving in with him ,even, which would happen in about 3 weeks. However, the past couple of months he’s been showing signs of emotional and verbal abuse.
If I bring up things that bother me, I feel invalidated and it always turns into him screaming at me, telling me he hates me, and calling me a f***ing idiot, then hanging up on me before I can give him my sincere apology for pissing him off or clarifying the meaning of my words. 
I always end up balling and taking blame for anything that happened, though he says I’m fake and don’t even know what I’m apologizing for. He says I’m cruel and vile, but when I ask for specifics, he never has any. At least nothing that would come close to those descriptions. 
I brought up to him that he’s been expressing abusive behavior and he’s removed me from all social media and put me on silent texts, telling me that I’m the abusive one. I don’t deny being abusive, because maybe I hurt him unintentionally. (I’m on the spectrum, so sometimes I don’t realize the way I say things, but I really do try and be gentle).
Anyway, because I’m so confused and hurt and feeling like the bad seed in all this, I’ve had the urge to find out if he has a history of abuse. I’m willing to work on things through time &amp; therapy, especially since I know his mother was verbally abusive toward her significant others, so I can understand if it’s a learned behavior. 
He has told me his ex was abusive and manipulative toward him, but he says the same about me, so I’m wondering…
I just don’t know, though. I feel like I need to know if it’s me, or both of us. 
So, yeah…would it be wrong of me to reach out to her?"

Then, he couldn't find the refrigerated pickles on the shelf.

Could not find bacon...looking in the freezer section.

Traded chives for dry dill.  

You name it he f'd it up.  

I ordered 20+ items, I ended up with 4. And somehow, he ended up getting items that cost more than half the original total.  

I could not believe that this man even tried, so I called a friend who works at the grocery store, and everything he said was not there was in stock, except one.  

So I have to have to pay my friend to get me what he did not.  

Oh and he also left the bag of the few things he brought me on my neighbors doorstep.  

So I took off the tip for the order.

Our daughter got a cup he left close to his computer and she knocked it down and it spilled on my husbands shorts so he threw something at his computer monitor and shattered it, then proceeded to punch holes in the walls of our house and kick stuff down the stairs. He’s never gotten physical with me or my daughter, and he says he’d never hit us, but part of me is terrified one day he’ll snap and punch me or my daughter."

Context I (30m single dad with deadbeat mom) ask him (30m unemployed and no responsibility) from time to time for help babysitting, and we have an agreement i pick him up and drop him off (thats about 120-140 miles round trip), i dont ask him for gas $, and he can crash at my place for 3-4 days. he just pays for his food because he is too picky. 

I ask him for only one Saturday out of the month so i can work my one scheduled saturday then come straight home, and i even let him use my car if he wants to go out.

I give him a few weeks notice so he can plan accordingly or tell me to look for someone else. This time (second time its happened) instead of him just telling me look for someone else and hell let me know otherwise because he has plans, he ignored me and made excuses for 12 days of ""im getting my sleep schedule in order"" (i call him or text him after 5pm), ""i was busy so thats why i didnt answer"" and stuff like that.

Now im 4 days from a day of work with no one to watch my kid and i have to scramble to find someone because a 30 year old couldnt just say ""i have plans already but if they fall through ill let you know""

TL;DR: asked friend 2 weeks ago for some help watching my kid. Friend waited until the last minute to tell me he had plans and to find someone else. Now i have to scramble to find someone."

Well one of the bands my younger sister listens to was on tour and where coming to the a neighboring city that isn’t to far away to drive from where we live. My sister worked extra hours to afford tickets, but sadly it wasn’t enough and was going to wait until a few days before the concert to buy the tickets. My sister is still under 18 and asked me to go with her since she needed someone over 18 to go with her. I told her sure and she was going to pay for my ticket and cover gas. 
Well a few days before the concert some of my friends invited me to go clubbing the night of the concert. I said sure, and told my sister that she would need to find someone else to take her, when I told her she started bawling her eyes out and shouting at me. She told me that I was a bitch for this and she would never forgive me. I told her she was exaggerating. 
Well the night of the concert came and I went with my friends to the club and when I got home my sister wouldn’t even look or speak to me. The next day I barged into her room telling her that she has no right to be treating me this way. That’s when she told me, “ You bitch, two years ago when the same band was on tour you said you would also take me. We made plans but you ended up going to go watch a movie with your stupid boyfriend, who ended up dumping you a week later, so I have every damn right, all you do is ditch me.” I was taken a back and told her that there will be many more concerts and that she was making a big deal about this one. We’ll later that day she went to go spend the night with her friend, and I told my parents what happened and they told me that it was bad from my Sadie that I told her I would take her and then bail on her. 
So that got me wondering if I am in the wrong for not taking her to the concert?"

My friend has a HUGE problem with hitting her boyfriend. &amp; I don’t mean just pushing him or
Pushing his face back with her hand I mean full on busting his lip, cracking his tooth, blacking his eye &amp; threw his PS5 off the balcony just because she was mad he wouldn’t get off the game. Every time she would do these things to him &amp; he looked like he wanted to swing back she would say”if you hit me your going to jail” which ofc stopped him from hitting her. 

Well last week was her boyfriends final straw. We were all in the car otw to see this new horror movie when my friend started an argument out the blue about how her boyfriend still does things for his bm. *Now to touch base on that he doesn’t do lovey dovey things he just sends her money for the kids &amp; would occasionally send food. His bm has Tourettes so there really isn’t a lot she can do &amp; her boyfriend just wants to make sure he’s being a good dad. But since he’s not in a situation where he can get custody of the kids just yet he does what he can*. 

My friends boyfriend pulled the car over &amp; they started yelling at each other &amp; arguing, 10mins into the argument my friend takes the back of her glass iPhone 12 Pro Max &amp; bashes his face with it. Busting his nose, his lip &amp; popping a blood vessel in his eye. He literally seen red, he got out of the drivers seat, walked around to the passengers door, opened the door &amp; drug my friend out the car.

He’s punching her *not in her face but like her sides &amp; such* he slapped her in her face so hard towards the end of the fight that it blacked her eye. 

After that she laid on the ground crying saying”you hit me I can’t believe you hit me” he told her she can either get up &amp; get in the car or he’s going to drive off without her.  She laid there &amp; rhays when he said”ight I’m leaving” he asked me if I wanted a ride home but I told him I was just going to stay behind &amp; call a Lyft. Once he drove off my friend blew up on me for not  defending her &amp; called me a bad friend. She also said that’s why I’m losing my best friend to a women who hates me which kinda hurt. I called a Lyft &amp; left her there &amp; we haven’t spoken since. 


To answer some of the questions that will probably pop up. *yes he went to the police multiple times but they didn’t take the women on male abuse story seriously, yes this was his 1st time putting his hands on her, no he has no sisters or cousins he could have called to help him &amp; the reason he didn’t leave was because he is blinded by love*

He’s gaslit me our entire relationship whenever I’ve had suspicions and always has told me I’m overthinking and other girlfriends wouldn’t be like this when I’ve brought things up.

Worse it’s that the 5 most recent girls all know and have met me. It’s not like they don’t know he has a partner.

w4kvvd_1191,w4kvvd,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"My dad and I (19F) frequently have arguments/fights over generally trivial things. He gets disproportionately angry very quickly, and because I protest against this, the arguments escalate (he starts yelling and insulting me, and I then start raising my voice and will eventually yell as well).

So yesterday around 5 pm I was talking to my dad, who said he was putting some frozen pizzas in the oven instead of cooking. 
I said that I wasn't hungry yet (I had lunch an hour before), so he could wait with mine. 
But then he said ""Oh I already put your pizza in the oven."" 

I got a bit annoyed at this and asked him why he did this because he didn't ask me anything and knew I had just eaten something already. 

He then got extremely angry with me and started yelling at me, and after some ranting said that he would take the pizza out of the oven and put it back into the freezer.

I was confused and said that it was fine, the pizza has already been in the oven, so just leave it there. I said I would just eat it.

He ignored me and put the now warm pizza back in the box. I asked him again to just leave it there and to stop, but he ignored me again. I thought he was acting childish so I approached him and tried to grab the pizza box. But he then pulled the pizza box back and pushed me away harshly.

And that's when I hit him. It was a spur of the moment decision, because he pushed me and I just felt helpless about the whole situation. My dad then slapped me back and put his finger up to say something scoldingly. 

I was in shock that he hit me back, so I stupidly decided to hit him again. When he then started yelling at me for hitting him again I walked away quickly upstairs to my room.


Some time after all of this, we tried to solve the argument (quite unsuccessfully). He did acknowledge that he maybe gets a bit too angry at me at times. But he kept putting the focus on the fact that I hit him, saying that I got anger issues etc. (I'm normally not at all aggressive, I almost never get into fights with people other than him).
He told me that physical aggression/hitting is a line that simply shouldn't be crossed, and while I agree, he is constantly crossing my boundaries by being verbally abusive. I just don't think it's fair that he is trying to blame me for the argument and being physically aggressive when he is the one that pushed me and was being verbally aggressive.

So am I the asshole?"

The delivery guy had a bit of an attitude but I brushed it off because it was a 93 degree day and he had to go back and forth to unload eight 20 inch tires. When he finished unloading he saw there were only seven tires and asked where the last one was. I told him I didn’t knew as I didn’t touch the tires and was busy writing the check. He asked again this time raising his voice and I responded that I didn’t knew keeping my tone the low. He stepped outside and slammed my door behind him. He came back 5 minutes later with the last tire and said that the tire had rolled in the back of the truck. I didn’t respond, instead signed the invoice and gave him the check. I called his boss to inform him about his actions and he said that he was going to take care of him. Today the driver stopped at the shop and screamed at me for getting him fired. I was perplexed and told him that his actions came with consequences and he should’ve thought of that before he acted the way he did. He said I was an AH amongst other things and left.

I explained that I would pay it but I also brought up the agreement we had regarding tuition. My mom has now reached out to my dad with the details of a payment plan she set up to pay my tuition.

I told her we didn't owe them and that anything we borrowed we paid back. I ended up blocking her but I feel because this was funding for their autism and care, that this is their money and should be spent on the kids.

We moved here 6 months ago to be closer to my husband's family, and they did help us move here, which I also wanted to pay them for about 500$ was what I had in mind though, and she says we owe them for helping us move. I told her we didn't owe them and that anything we borrowed we paid back. I ended up blocking her but I feel because this was funding for their autism and care, that this is their money and should be spent on the kids. I don't feel like lending them anything now and am angry that we've been getting called names and that FIL is telling everyone we said no and that we owe them.. so... If I don't lend them the 1000$... AITA??"
w6m3bu_1245,w6m3bu,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I 18F live with my bf 26 M. Since being together we broke up once and both saw other people then ended up getting back together. During that time his mom and dad stalked me on social media and said I was a whore, cheater, and liar for having a new bf at the time. When we did get back together him and I found out I was pregnant. So we decided to move in together. (His parents said I should get an abortion and leave his life). Just some back story, I’ve been on my own since i was 18 and he’s lived with his parents his whole life. Since living together his parents expect him to still pay bills at there house, let them use his truck and not put gas, and take up a lot of his time. I told him that none of these things he has to do but he told me to be more “understanding and don’t judge”. Things he didn’t say when I was being called nasty names by them. So I said if he wanted to help then he could but I wouldn’t be paying any bills he’s short on (his truck payments and braces) if he wanted to just use the money for them. He’s now calling me controlling and unreasonable because I don’t want to pay for his family. I really need another opinion. So tell me AITA?"

We've been bestfriends for 12 years now and in class we got a new student (f17), lets call her Tammy. Tammy, Harper, and I clicked. We hung out all of the time but something felt different after a month or two. Tammy and Harper started leaving me out a ton and Tammy started spreading rumors about me, making my life miserable.

 After four months of that, Harper and I were sitting on the bus together and she's showing me a picture for her dog. She started getting text from a hate group about me! I snatched her phone and started looking at the texts, I was horrified of what my so called ""bestfriends"" were calling me behind my back. I knew who made the group just by reading the text. Tammy. I call Tammy and I say to her ""Really Tammy?? *my name* Hate group?? Have anything to say about that??"" She replies back with ""What? What are you talking about??"" So I hung up on her because I knew she was lying, she was in the group for God sake and talking about me!

 I got off of the bus, went inside, and talked to my mother about what was going on because I didn't know what to do.. Next thing you know I get a call from Tammy, I answer and pit it on speaker for my mom. She says ""hi. I am so sorry. I don't even know who made that group."" My mom snatched the phone and says ""Don't call my daughter, acting like a friend now when you've made her miserable for 4 months and separated her and Harper. I am sick and tired of my baby coming home from school and crying to me abou how you are treating her"" Tammy hung up and an hour later I'm getting texts and calls. 
Everyone is asking me why my mom is harassing Tammy. She wasn't harassing?? She was standing  up for her child!

 I tell them what happened but then so many people are asking, that I can't take it. I go to school the next day, go up to Tammy and Harper and say ""You can say all you want about me, you can make me miserable, you can spread rumors about me, but DO NOT bring my mother into this. She is a wonderful person and has been nothing but nice to you. She even payed $400 for a school trip for you. DONT say another word about my mom.""  And I walked away.

Longtime lurker and first time poster. This will be long and I apologize for that, I want to make sure you guys have all of the important details to properly come to your decision. 

So a little backstory: I (22F) love animals. I have somewhere around 15 pets and most of them are exotic, 4 of them happen to be rats. They are the sweetest babies and I have trained them to do tricks just so I would have an excuse to spend more and more time with them. They get so excited when anyone comes near their cage that they start hopping up and down and wiggle their cute little butts. 

Now I want to be a mom so bad but I cant have children do to fertility issues so my animals ARE my children. I would die for them. Well in 2020 my family caught covid and it almost killed my Nana (60F) and I. We were both hospitalized and put on oxygen however, I was only on oxygen for a week.. my Nana, unfortunately, is still on it. 

She was previously living with my mom (41F), brothers (20M and 14M), step father (IDK) and I and has always lived with us for most if not my entire life but when the covid wave hit we sent her to live with my aunt and her husband because it was safer for her there considering there isn't a bunch of people coming and going over there unlike my moms house. Well recently her doctor said that she cannot be around rodents and that it would affect her health tremendously if she was. And because she was ready to come home (she had been living with my aunt for 6 months by that point and missed us terribly), I had to make the hard decision to rehome my rats. I have been grieving over this and my heart was and still is broken and I've cried nonstop but it's what's best to keep my Nana alive. 

Here is where the story gets fucked up. I was still actively looking for a home at the time this took place a couple months ago. However, apparently this wasn't good enough for my aunt (43F) and she went to my brother (20M) in secret and tried to convince him to feed my rats rat poison so when Nana ultimately came home, her health wasnt compromised. He agreed to do it for $40 (I found the text messages on his phone of this whole conversation). She bought it and stashed the bag in his jeep at my moms home when no one was there. Well my brother didn't have the heart to do it. He eventually told my mom what she was trying to do behind our backs. However he did take her money, so he essentially got a $40 handout and I think that's hilarious. 

Fast forward a few days, my mom had just gotten back in town (she is a traveling nurse) and she went to feed the rats as I couldnt because I was staying over with my boyfriend whom I now live with. Well she noticed something odd in their food bowl. It was completely full of pellets we don't own. When she realized what it was she called me immediately and told me everything. And this is when I learned about the messages and everything between her and my brother. 

Apparently my aunt had snuck in the house while all of us were gone and filled my rats bowl up with rat poisoning. It was completely full of it. Once I got over the complete and utter shock and disbelief I texted her and called her a few choice words. I mean, I completely blew up on her because those are my babies ! She didn't deny it. I told her that this has ruined our relationship completely and that I will never have anything to do with her ever again. And she said she didn't care if I ever spoke to her again over this and that she was just looking out for her mother. It ended with me telling her she was dead to me. I was and still am so heartbroken that she just completely tossed me to the side. She knew that she would lose me if she did this and she did it anyway, and literally said that she did not care if we ever had a relationship after this. I meant nothing to her apparently and that will always hurt. 

What she fed them was something that makes their little bellies explode. It kills them slowly and painfully. I understandably cried for days and days because we did not know if they had eaten any of it. At that point I was just waiting for my rats to die a slow and painful death. Thankfully they did not and have since been rehomed to a safe place. 

This is where I might be the asshole. My aunt has been planning on divorcing her husband for YEARS. She has kept it a secret from him so she can stash away money and do other things so she can come out on top after the divorce as well as finish the house renovations they have been working on for years so she can sell it and ultimately screw him over in the process as well as leave him homeless. She was going to take him for everything hes got. So, in a fit of rage, I texted my uncle and told him everything and provided screenshots that she had previously sent to my brothers phone before they made their ""deal"" admitting to all of this and talking about how she has a separate secret account where shes saving up money and other incriminating things. From what I gathered from my Nana (she was still living there at the time I sent these messages), it was like an atomic bomb went off in that house. Apparently they were screaming and crying at eachother non stop and ultimately, he went to stay at his mothers house and she went to her dads. Their relationship is now really rocky and he no longer trusts her. I have no idea if he is planning on trying to fix his marriage or not as I have cut all communications with them. 
It ended with her texting me telling ME that I was dead to HER, to forget she was my aunt and that she never wants to see my face again. She also said if I step foot on her property then she will call the police. 

My family, though they are on my side and they agree that what she did was wrong, says I went too far by trying to break up their marriage stating that my aunt still hadnt truly made up her mind about whether she wanted to leave him or not and was just saying those things and preparing for it in case she did. But I don't think so. I think justice was served. But for the sake of it AITA ?


Edit: So to answer this question, the reason why I did not take the rats with me when I moved out is because I had no idea I would be moving out as I had no intentions on doing so at that time and I didn't move until months after this whole thing took place, and unfortunately, even if I did know that I would be leaving I couldn't hang on to them until then as they had to be gone before my Nana came home. I wouldn't have made her wait a few months to come home if I had known because my aunt made my nanas life a living hell and she and her husband were so fucking cruel to her the entire time she was there."

My mother was always highly abusive to my half brother and I ( physically, mentally and sexually).
She was physically abusive to my dad.
My brother committed suicide when I was 12 him 19. His note listed his abuse. 
In my soft more year 16 different phone calls went to child protective services about my mom beating me unconscious in the local grocery store parking lot.  She manipulated the system and got out of it.

Fast forward to when I'm 21. 
I told my dad that I'm done with living this way and that I can not stand seeing him hurt. He agreed so we started making plans to escape and start a new life.

Everything was going well and we were keeping our plans hidden well. So we thought. 
We were trying to find a place to move and start my parents divorce. 

I worked night shift. I was sleeping.  My mom took my phone from my night stand.
She went through it. Now at the time I was 21 and I paid for my own phone.  I was also partying and exploring my sexuality.  So yeah there were explicit pictures and messages.  There was also messages between my  father and I. She took screen shots of everything and showed them to her side of the family  and strangers at her work.  I only found out about it because she showed my underage niece.  Dad and I went to confront her.  I was pissed.  She shoved a gun in my mouth ( pretty normal thing for her to do to me.) She said all of this was my fault. 

2 weeks go by of uncomfortable silence.  Dad and I have separate plans for 4th of July.  I go my way he goes his. We both got home at about midnight and its pouring rain.  
Our house keys no longer match the door. 

Next day cops help us in the house to collect our things.  Most of dad and is belongings are destroyed.  My dog beaten.  And my shoe box with $25,000 is gone.

My parents divorce started.  I told my dad I didn't want to be involved and he respected that. My mom kept dragging me in. She tried to gas light me constantly.  She spread disgusting rumors about my dad and I.  
Her , her church members and her brothers started stalking me and threatening to kill me and dad. My grandmother hasn't heard the truth and refuses to talk with me. 
My dad and I have been homeless and starting our lives from scratch. 

Once the divorce was done my mom contacted me to start shit. I told her never to contact me again. 

She always kept trying. 

My 27th birthday she used a gastation phone to call me. 
I blew up. and told her that my CPTSD and depression were all rooted from her. That I had lost everything that can't be bought with money.  That I hated her guts and she needed to learn the words leave me alone.

So about a month and a half ago, I went to my cousin's graduation, and after the graduation, we had a party at a small local restaurant that we all regularly frequent.

When we got there, it was only my family and my cousin's family that were there, but after 15 minutes, a friend of our parents came and brought in their 2 kids. One was the same age as me, 16, and the other was 6 or 7.

During this 'party', the little kid kept playing around with the menu and random things by hitting me in the face with them. Whenever I told her to stop, she would come back a few minutes later and do it again. If I told the adults about it, they would say things like, ""She's just playing around, let it go.""

After 2 hours of this, I got tired of what she was doing and told her to 'leave me the fuck alone'. But saying this leads to a mistake where the kid now won't leave me alone, saying ""You said the f word."" ""You said a bad word."" And things like that while still hitting me with the paper.

This led to her running to her mom to tell her I hit her. So in the end I ended up getting grounded for 2 weeks as a result.

But I don't feel bad for what I did as I have anger issues and very low patience, so I can get irritated easily. But my cousin (whose graduation party it was) and I were talking yesterday and she said that I was an AH for hitting the kid, so IDK, am I the AH?"

So about a month and a half ago, I went to my cousin's graduation, and after the graduation, we had a party at a small local restaurant that we all regularly frequent.

When we got there, it was only my family and my cousin's family that were there, but after 15 minutes, a friend of our parents came and brought in their 2 kids. One was the same age as me, 16, and the other was 6 or 7.

During this 'party', the little kid kept playing around with the menu and random things by hitting me in the face with them. Whenever I told her to stop, she would come back a few minutes later and do it again. If I told the adults about it, they would say things like, ""She's just playing around, let it go.""

After 2 hours of this, I got tired of what she was doing and told her to 'leave me the fuck alone'. But saying this leads to a mistake where the kid now won't leave me alone, saying ""You said the f word."" ""You said a bad word."" And things like that while still hitting me with the paper. Then after another hour of this I got tired of her and chopped her in the head. I didn't want to use to much power to hit her but I forgot that she was just a kid so I made her cry.

This led to her running to her mom to tell her I hit her. So in the end I ended up getting grounded for 2 weeks as a result.

My other brother gets to go (his only blood sibling, cuz me n bro aren’t blood related) yes, I understand that it’s her day but it’s his too so he should be able to have a say. I didn’t know before hand that I couldn’t see him say “I do” so I canceled all my birthday plans to be there for him on his day. Just to find out his fiancé doesn’t want me there. I love him n I will still go to the reception but AITA for being pissed at her?


To clarify my brother is apart of the issues but his fiancé is the one running the show. My brother love him to death but he’s not very out spoken n will not stand up for what he wants. I am mad at him but I’m more so mad at the fiancé. Also it’s the grooms family paying for everything so why does she get the most say? I know it’s her day but she needs to think about how he feels."

She got a boyfriend (16 M) about 9 or 10 months ago that i absolutely hate but she is head over heels for. I've hated him since almost the minute I've met him. He's very overprotective, mean to others, mean to me and our other siblings, and very very controlling. But recently, it's gotten much worse. I'm talking doesn't let her leave before he sees her clothes, never lets her do her makeup, can't posts TikTok's of herself, etc.  Last night, we added our cousin (15 M) on her snapchat, because he hadn't had it until now. Her boyfriend found out had through a hissy fit, but we thought that would be it since he has fits all the time and all that normally comes out of it are nasty words to harm her self esteem (I'm not ok with this either). So me and her get on omegal for a bit when my cousin texts me ""Hey, why'd your sister block me?"" we find out that her boyfriend logged into her account and blocked EVERY boy she had, including cousins, dad, classmates, you get the idea. I told her that this wasn't ok and she needed to break up with him. She wouldn't do it, so finally, when I dropped her off at home the next day with our mom, i explained the entire situation with her in private, leading to my mom forcing her to break up with her boyfriend, and now doing phone checks to see if he's talking to him. I feel like this went a little too far, but now my sister won't talk to me. So AITA?"

While she was pregnant the first time, she gradually went from pro-vaccine to vaccine-hesitant to fully anti-vax, I think largely based on the influence of her husband and ""research"" materials he provided her. (The materials are 4 books and some websites.)

While this was distressing and a decision I did not support at all, I was still supportive of my sister in general and visited several times during the pregnancy and when her son was born. The vaccine conversation would still occasionally come up, along with her and her husband's increasingly right-wing political views, but since we clashed so terribly it was a topic we mostly avoided. 

Then Covid-19 happened, and her second pregnancy. I didn't visit during lockdown, but I did come out when her daughter was born. I was pretty vigilant about mask-wearing, for which she criticized me and insisted I not wear one in the house. It was uncomfortable enough that I've simply avoided coming out to visit again. 

Our parents, however, are both in their 70s, live out-of-state, and have continued to visit, and she has gone to see them as well. Our parents both got vaccinated and boosted as soon as they could. I'm frustrated with my sister for refusing the vaccine, but I acknowledge that battle is lost. What I can't get past is her refusal to mask or test, and for discouraging my parents from masking in her presence. 

This led to me kind of ghosting her texts for a while when my frustration with her recklessness hit a tipping point, and when I confessed my frustrations and that I wanted to avoid fighting with her, and would simply rather not engage, her end went silent.

But she went to our mom, who has been trying to convince me to let this go and it's making me feel a bit unreasonable and immature. I've let a lifetime of my sister's selfish actions pile up on me without being very good at enforcing my own boundaries, so perhaps this is going a bit nuclear over the issue at hand. And I don't enjoy upsetting my parents. 

Admittedly, though, I have enjoyed the break from her nonsense and drama. Even at our closest, we were never really friends, so it's not a relationship I especially mourn the absence of. (I do miss my nephew and niece, of course. They are cute kids and innocent in all this.)

w9xfym_1339,w9xfym,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (18f) have not had a relationship with either of my biological parents (Now 38m and 40f) since I was 13. My dad is pretty severely mentally ill and my mom has a personality disorder, she often enables my fathers illnesses. When I was 13 my father decided to move out of our family home and live somewhere by himself, cutting his contact from me and my mom or so I thought. Following my dad's decision my mom and I decided that it would be best if she and I went to live near my grandparents (who lived a few states away). She suggested I should go there first without her to start school so that she could ""sell the house."" I went and waited for months for my mom to show up but she never did and she also eventually cut off contact with me. Luckily I have a really amazing grandma who has been taking great care of me.

We found out about a year later from some of my dad's family members, who had surprisingly heard from my dad, that he and my mom were living together happily somewhere. I was obviously crushed upon hearing that my parents had decided to move on with their life together without me.

A few months ago my mom somehow found my email and reached out to me for the first time in almost 5 years. She was overjoyed to finally get a hold of me and announce that she and my father had a two year old girl and a 6 month old boy. She gushed about their personalities, how they looked like me as a baby, etc. I was honestly horrified and shocked as after everything that they had done I couldn't believe they would have more kids.

I ended up not responding to her email but since then I have received over a dozen more and even got a video on my birthday of the two year old singing happy birthday to me. In every email my mom made a point to talk about how much I would love them and how she wishes I could come and visit to meet them. I had no interest in doing that however and had no interest in acknowledging it as my reality. Through all the emails she sent she never once asked how I was, how school was or even how I felt about having siblings. She didn't take a single second to be concerned over me.
So I decided to block her email and continue on with my current life. I have talked through it with my grandma and she agrees it would be better this way. The part of my mom's side that knows agrees with me but my dad's side can't believe that I would ignore and practically disown my siblings. They think that I'm being selfish and immoral for never wanting a relationship with my siblings or my parents. Even my own therapist thinks I'm being a little harsh.

(I am not in any way mad at the kids for this situation but for the sake of my mental health I don't want to be a part of their lives or reconnect with my parents. I simply can't get over the fact that they abandoned me to live an entirely new life including having more kids. My parents were also mentally abusive throughout my life and I do not want to invite that in again)

So AITA for not wanting a relationship with my siblings?"

He sleeps at my place every night, but he goes back to his place during the day and he doesn’t keep any of his stuff at mine. Last night he was out with his friends and when he came to my place he was flat out drunk and immediately went to sleep. I am working nights so I’m awake at that time. Around 4 in the morning, his phone started to ring, I usually ignore it when he gets a call while sleeping, but this one kept calling so I answered it. The call was through fb messenger, and the person’s profile name is Nom, so I guessed that wasn’t their real name. A girl answered and she was calling my boyfriend’s name. I asked her who she was, and she told me she’s my bf’s boss. Now my bf works freelance so I know for a fact he doesn’t have a boss. I asked her what her name was, and she told me to just ask my bf about it. I told her my bf is sleeping and asked her what her name is again. That’s when she told me she’ll sl—ap my mouth and sh*ot me. I called her rude and hung up on her. She kept calling after that so I put my bf’s phone on silent. Today, my bf found out what happened, and he got mad at me for answering his phone. He told me the girl is someone he does odd jobs for, like driving her around or something. He accused me of sabotaging one source of income for him, since apparently the girl pays way too much than the usual and it’s easy money for him. I told him the girl was rude to me, and he told me I wouldn’t have gotten that treatment from her had I not answered his phone, and that I don’t even know her enough to call her rude.

My sister has been saying you like your friends more than your family for a while now. Amy and Avery have seem to also agree with their mom. They say “you like your friends more huh” it got to the point when my other sister Stephanie scolded them for it and didn’t let them us the tv for a day.  My friend how can cook really good food invited me to go eat some with her. I asked my  mom and she said that it was okay. Mary heard this and says “ than she should make food for all of us” i replied to her and said “no she made ME food, her FRIEND” this shut her up for a while but the nasty remarks have not left yet.

So do you think I should have taken my nieces with me to the movies even though I didn’t want to?"
waxfkm_1384,waxfkm,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"For context I 17(F) have been in a relationship with my 18(M) boyfriend since the fifth grade. My boyfriends sister 23(F) has been married to her husband 24(M) since she was 18, she currently has 3 kids a set of twins 4(M) and 4(F) along with her 2(F) daughter, I get along with her kids very well and my boyfriend loves this that I'm close with my future nieces and nephew. But my problem is a couple of weeks ago I was babysitting for her as her and her husband went out on a date I heard the twins talking about how they're getting a new sibling. I looked at them all confused and asked ""What do you mean by that?"" They look at me as they smile and say ""Mommy said she is pregnant!"" I look at my neice and nephew in shock.

And a few days later was a family reunion because it was an urgent matter involving my 8(M) nephew's recent health problems, so we all arrive at reunion I was invited for obvious reasons. I can see my 29(F) sister-in-law about ready to cry along with her husband 30(M) comforted her as he squeezed her hand. I grab my boyfriend's hand for comfort because I know something bad is about to happen ""You all know that everyone is here because of our son.. we found the reason why he is so sick.."" my sister-in-law bursts into tears as I  go to get up and comfort her, hear something I wish I had never heard in my entire life ""My cancer had passed to are son and he is at stage three.."" her husband starts tearing up.

After that sentence I feel physically ill and my boyfriend said I looked physically ill as well, my brother had cancer and just barely survived and I myself had that Gene it was caught early on so I was okay. My other sister-in-law seems very slightly sad by this news she starts fidgeting in her seat and I was just waiting for her to say something, her husband whispered to her seemingly begging her not to do something, I narrow my eyes at her as she slowly gets up and started to speak ""I'm sorry that we had to tell you this way but it's urgent... I'm pregnant again!"" And she said that with a huge smile on her face not even thinking about what my other sister-in-law and her husband feel that their child was diagnosed with cancer. 

At this point all I was seeing was red my anger had bubbled up like a volcano ready to spew, I waited a few more words before I said my choice of words ""we wanted to tell you before the gender reveal happens."" After that I lost it I stood straight up from my chair as it scraped across the floor I glared at her ""you are an insensitive b*tch your sister told you that your nephew has cancer and you decide now is the time to tell everyone that you're pregnant no one cares that you're pregnant your nephew is sick and all you can do is be selfish!"" 

After that most of my boyfriend's family look at her with displeased look and shaking of there heads most of the family is on my side including my boyfriend my sister-in-law and her husband along with my mother-in-law and father-in-law. but my boyfriend's aunt sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband and a few other relatives are angry at me for causing stress to a pregnant woman and saying that she could miscarry from the stress I caused her. I feel no remorse or regret for what I said. But I think I took it just a little bit too far, I am very close with my 8(M) nephew he even calls me auntie. I'm very attached to him he even has the same cancer as me and my brother (Liver cancer) 

To make him feel better I got my brother and myself to go to the hospital for my nephew and we showed him our scars I told him the one thing I knew that would cheer him up, I told him ""Only superheroes get really sick so they can pass their trial for their powers I passed and I know you're going to pass as well!"" I never saw him smile as much as he did after  I said that, he started rambling about how cool his powers where gonna be. (To this day I'm still getting angry text and phone calls from my sister-in-law telling me I'm an asshole and that she can miscarry from the stress I have causing her) So am I the asshole?..

EDIT: I have severe social anxiety I can barely get through a conversation most of the time(Unless I am comfortable with that person) {I have never met some of these family members I was supposed to meet them at the reunion} , also I have a fear of talking in front of a lot of people, Some of you have been saying I spoke up to get the attention on myself which is completely untrue I wanted to get the attention back on my nephew's health. And I understand what I did was 'Wrong' but I couldn't let her brush over the fact that our nephew is sick.

The reason why I was so mad I had a family gathering as well when my mother told my family that I was sick, and my sister actually announced her pregnancy after our mother told the family. I was immediately looked over and the attention went straight to her, I said nothing as this happened I was just quiet the only one who didn't give her any attention was my brother he was actually hugging me. I only said that because I didn't want the same thing to happen to my nephew the same reason I was ignore well I had cancer for 9 months as all the attention went to my sister"

wbprii_1391,wbprii,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"24(F) I know this sounds bad but 2 years ago I decided to not attend my older sister's wedding because her wife kept trying to hit on me and it made me uncomfortable.



So a little backstory my sister met this girl online and everything was going well they went on dates they were talking about adopting they were talking about traveling the world and I was ecstatic that my sister found someone they didn't treat her like shit so I was okay with it.




One day I invite her and her girlfriend everything is going good I cook dinner I did everything and my power to make sure it went off with out a hitch now now here's where things went bad my sister said she need to go to the bathroom and when she went to the bathroom her girlfriend said ""are you tryna get under this table and eat this glitter box?""  I quickly looked confused and said ""What?"" She then went under the table and started to try to unzip my pants but my sister came out of bathroom and she got from under the table I was clearly uncomfortable so I told my sister that it's late can I go home and they went.


Fast forward 6 months past this I went to dinner with my mom and dad and my sister and her girlfriend announced they were getting married I was happy but I had to go to the bathroom my sister's girlfriend followed me in  an slapped my butt and tried to force me to put my hand under her dress and I pepper sprayed her and left the restaurant family didn't talk to me for like 2 weeks


When was time for my sister's wedding to roll around she asked was like I like and I said no and she asked why I said her girlfriend makes me uncomfortable and after all the shit  she's pulled and you're still marrying her is enough reason for me to stop messing with you my sister hung up and my mom and dad called condemning me saying I'm ruining my sister's wedding calling me an asshole

wbstfi_1399,wbstfi,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Now dont get me wrong.. I(19F) love the little snot picker but its just a lot.... For starters he lives with me and my mom and my dad. My older sister (24) has moved out already but a little before that she left behind my nephew who I must admit is the devils spawn, hes not like other two year olds, I cant bag in to put it into words what its like living with him but hes just a major hand full and puts my mom (56) and dad (59) umder alot of strain. 

Now how this kid came to be was a mistake. My sister got him when she was in a 4month firefighter training program. His dad is an obvious deadbeat like, you could see it from a mile away that you should not procreate with this man. But the damage was done and with abortion too late to be an option and my mom hates thw idea of adoption, she kept it. So this kid before he was born was a problem. 

Keeping this unwanted pregnancy she goes off for work and lives two hours away. I hated that idea of leaving him behind because it proves me right keeping me up within the crying while i was doing my final exams. By then I was fresh out of highschool (I nearly failed). My parents being kept up by this baby they didnt even bother to ask me of my ambitions or ask me about collage like they did with my sister and just left me floating there with nothing to do and expected me to already know. With my sister they did EvErYtHinG for her, take her to school,help her get her drivers license, etc. Leaving me to do everything myself. 

Now two years down the line hes being treated like hes my sibling and im being forced to share or give him my ipad cause he cries over it. My point is... Its not fair. Its not fair for my sister to get all the attention after she finished school and being an abomination that stole my parents away. They're not getting any younger and im missing out on the guidance they could have given me fresh the out of high school wisdom instead of me leaening the hard way. My mom is starting to see my resentment surface and I had a talk with them on how I feel ,they understood but ""hes still an innocent child"" they say. 

Today is his second birthday and they pulled all the stops to plan a big party where on mine they literally forgot except my boyfriend who bothered to get me a cake. This was supposes to be my time to shine as only child and the attention to be on me but my sister has to take it all away again. I cant help but feel bitter. Only my boyfriend understands my frustration but everyone else says im an asshole for hating the kid. I dont hate him... Well at least thats what I want to belive. So.. AITA?


[[Edit]] : after reading the comments I realize maybe I was wrong in some parts. But as ive said 'devils spawn' I mean something about this kids is seriously wrong hes a legitimate nightmare. He breaks things, throws tantrums and makes a terrible mess and im not talking about two year old mess I mean straight up hoarding, my room is a separate building in the yard and walking in the house gives me major anxiety because of the mess. He keeps my mom on her toes and with me amd my dad gone to work any cleaning bearly gets done. 

As much as I would love to move out, my country doesnt have a high employment rate and the job im working now is nOT enough to sustain myself but even so I cant just leave my mom with the kids, it'll send her blood pressure through the roof. 

Ive told my sister how she cant burden our parents with her child. She goes ""if you dont want my child you should have just said so.."" You see that? Thats emotional blackmail right there. Causing my parents to bend over backwards to physically and financially support a child they didnt ask for at MY EXPENSE and I just found out they started a college fund with some of MY college fund money for him. I was livid and when I screamed at them im being called selfish. OoooHhH bOY I thought I couldnt dislike this kid even more. I get it its my parents fault and my sisters even bigger fault. But I just cant think back that wether hes aware of it or not but I just cant stop resenting him. In my head I just kept thinking back just how much bwtter mt life would have been if he just vanished or something. Its awful it know but ....still"

i (21f) am expecting my first child in November with my partner (22m) and we are on the fence about whether we will allow my mom to be a part of our lives. I think it’s justifiable but let me know if it isn’t. 

Ever since i became pregnant, she has been posting about my child and not tagging me and accepting congratulations from people and accepting messages like “do you need anything?”. She also has been asking me for a registry link so she can send it to her friends (of course i will accept the help) but when i asked her to just send them my phone number she got angry and started yelling at me saying i can’t tell her what to do and she doesn’t have time for that. Which confused me because she has the time to directly send my registry to everyone but not send them my phone number. She doesn’t want to send anyone my way regarding gifts for my child. 

At our gender reveal, while my partner was messing with the firework that we already used, she had approached me making comments about naming my child like “you need to name him…” or “me and your aunt have decided his name should be…” but then stopped talking when my partner approached us. That same night, she had said in front of everyone including my partner that she’d be kissing my baby behind my back even though i asked that nobody do that because she’s the grandma and deserves to do whatever she wants. I had said also in front of everyone “if you do that, you aren’t going to be seeing our child again”. She yelled at me later saying i had embarrassed her in front of her friends and her kissing her grandchild isn’t a big deal.

Last night she had yelled at me and my partner over the phone saying we need to just do everything her way (regarding pregnancy and raising our child) because we have never been pregnant before and we have never had a child before. She had me and my brother when she was 19 and 21 and had left us home alone overnight as young children because she wanted to see her friends and go to bars. And she’s trying to tell us that she knows better than us. 

I am a preschool teacher and i’ve worked with newborns to 12 years old since i was 16 years old and had always dreamed of becoming a mother and i feel like it’s being taken away from me because my mom views me as incapable of raising a human being. Am i overreacting?

EDIT: 
this is a message she sent me unprovoked and with no prior communication related since the post was made.
“I just want you to know that I am really trying to educate myself on boundaries and what  you guys as parents may expect from me as a grandparent. Also, reminiscing about what was really frustrating about Mamaw when you guys were kids and how I do not want to have a strained relationship with you and keiden in regards to your son. I want to be there but I do realize that there are boundaries that I need to respect. I do hope that you also understand that everything I do for you is because I love you and your son and I have always and will always want nothing but happiness and health for you guys. ❤️”"

And she’s trying to tell us that she knows better than us. 

I am a preschool teacher and i’ve worked with newborns to 12 years old since i was 16 years old and had always dreamed of becoming a mother and i feel like it’s being taken away from me because my mom views me as incapable of raising a human being. Am i overreacting?

EDIT: 
this is a message she sent me unprovoked and with no prior communication related since the post was made.
“I just want you to know that I am really trying to educate myself on boundaries and what  you guys as parents may expect from me as a grandparent. Also, reminiscing about what was really frustrating about Mamaw when you guys were kids and how I do not want to have a strained relationship with you and keiden in regards to your son. I want to be there but I do realize that there are boundaries that I need to respect. I do hope that you also understand that everything I do for you is because I love you and your son and I have always and will always want nothing but happiness and health for you guys. ❤️”"
wd1qni_1445,wd1qni,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I few months ago I(21f) got a call from a friend, A(24m) asking me to take his 8 month old puppy. Initially, I said no because of health issues I've been having for the past year and I wouldn't have the time to take care of him. A said that if I didn't take him he was going to the pound so now I have a puppy. When I got him he was skinny and didn't act like a puppy should. I took him to the vet, he had an ear infection and was a little malnutritioned. We got him right as rain and now he's a happy lil guy. My neighbors kid loves playing with him, I pay a service to walk him twice a day, my friends and I take him to the beach and on car rides. He's happy. Now my friend A called me earlier and wants him back. He asked me when a good time to pick him up would be and I didn't say anything. I don't want to give him back. I've put a lot into him and I really think he's better here. I'm not sure what to do though. Do I really have to give him back?

Update: I'm not giving him back. I can't let him take him when he doesn't take care of him. He was going to take him to the pound if I didn't take him, you can't just get your dog back from the pound. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow."
wdi0ih_1450,wdi0ih,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"I know the title sounds bad, but let me explain. So I(14 genderfluid) had a horrible grandmother(83F), who was never there for me. She always liked my cousins more, because they are men. For context as to why this is relevant, I am AFAB and my grandma had two daughters(my mother and my aunt). My aunt(51F) has always been one of the closest relatives to me, even closer than my parents, due to the fact they only care for my academic success and not my mental and physical health. My mother(46F) was never close to my grandmother, as she was always neglected as a child and only had my grandfather(deceased). My aunt on the other hand, has a seriously strong bond with her mother. She was the favorite child, that's for sure, and even she admits that. I tried my best to keep it together and show a happy face towards my grandma until 2 years ago, only a few weeks after my grandfather's death, she gave away the toy piano my grandpa gave me to this one 3 years old relative, who to this day can't speak, eat or drink properly. I was furious. This may not seem like a big deal, but to me it was, as that small little toy piano was the last thing I had from my grandfather who always treated me with nothing but kindness and love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that day, I swore to never step foot anywhere near my grandmother, however, last year, I had to attend for her birthday lunch. This incident was probably the one that made my dislike for her strong enough to do what I did. As soon as we(my mother and I) arrived, it was obvious I was not really welcome there. I kept quiet and read something whilst the others were chatting away, until my aunt came up to me to ask if I was okay, since I was visibly upset. I told her I didn't feel welcomed and wanted to go home. She promised as soon as I finished my plate she'd take me home. And she did. But before I got in her car, my grandmother yelled after me, calling me a useless child and telling me she never wants to see me again.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 months ago, she(my grandma) got really sick and got into the hospital. She begged my aunt to take me to her, but I refused. After all she did to me? Hell no. I told my aunt this, who repeatedly tried to convince me to do otherwise, but it didn't work. I love my aunt a lot, but not enough for this. About 2 weeks after that my grandma finally passed away. I called my best friend(19F) right after the news and she came over to celebrate with me. This may sound like an asshole move, but I honestly didn't give two shits.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago, my grandmother's funeral took place. My aunt came to convince me to come in person, but I explained to her I was not going, as I would not be able to stand the amount of respect this scum of earth would be getting from every relative. She was visibly upset by this, but respected my decision and left soon after. My mother got really mad at me for refusin to attend and called me a ""selfish bitch who has no respect for his ancestors and needs to get a grip"". She and my father(53M) left for the funeral shortly after and in a sudden rage, I called my best friend. I told her to pick me upp with her car.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as she arrived, I hopped in the car and connected my phone to her car's speakers. We slowly drove around the cemetery the funeral was held at before finally decidin on the perfect time to blast the absolute banger that is ""The wicked witch is dead"". In the middle of the funeral speech, I started blasting the song starting from ""Ding dong the witch is dead, the wicked witch is deaaaaad"". An angry looking aunt stormed outside of the cemetary and just caught a glimpse of my red hair, which was enough for her to identify me. We sped off, and thought nothing would come of this little ""prank"".

&amp;#x200B;

After the funeral ended, I got a very angry call from my mother yelling at me for this manouvre. I could hear my aunt calming her down, which was a suprise, because I thought she(aunt) would be the angrier one. I hung up on my mom, and in that second my phone rang, indicating my aunt was calling me. She in the end scolded me a little bit and told me this was an asshole move to pull. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom called me an asshole too, I didn't really care much about that, but when my aunt did it,it got to me, so AITA?

My brother got a defensive &amp; said ""well none of the other bridesmaids know any of my groomsmen either. Whats the big deal?!"".... I kind of got quite. I didn't know what to say. I felt like he should know exactly what the big deal is... so back story (trigger warning) i was molested as a kid &amp; in March of 2019 I was raped &amp; raped again 7 months later. Im very weary around men in general because of it. Typically I don't have a problem being around men, as long as they stay out of my bubble. 

Just the thought of a man I don't know, holding my hand/linking arms with me makes me panic &amp; makes my skin crawl. I texted my brother after the call &amp; said:
""I know you don't &amp; can't understand... &amp; you'll probably role your eyes about it &amp; perhaps you'll scoff as if im dramatic, but men in general make me uncomfortable. That is where I am right now. If you can't do anything, it's fine &amp; I'll just have to deal"".... he didn't reply

I brough it up to my mom today &amp; she agreed with my brother. She acted as if I was being dramatic. She basically said ""it's 2 minutes out of your day, it's not going to kill you. If it's really going to ruin your day or life to link arms then drop out of the wedding. It's your brother's wedding. It's not about you""  
here's the thing, I can't drop out of the wedding. Iv already spent well over $200 for the dress &amp; shoes. Plus dropping out would mean my brother would have to drop one of his groomsmen.

Maybe I am the a-hole &amp; im just being dramatic. Im trying to convince myself that I am in fact just being dramatic &amp; everything will be okay, but I can't shake the panic. Idk what do

Thank you everyone for the support &amp; advice. You don't know how much I needed it

A lot of you suggested talking to the bride... though she is a sweetheart &amp; she may be sympathetic, it is not something she would understand nor would she be willing to change order for me. Especially once she talks to my brother. They are both very traditional &amp; conservative 

As far as my mom goes... she isn't a bad person. She is typically very supportive... idk. The thing is, I understand my mom taking his side... I understand that my brother &amp; the bride want a specific line up. I understand wanting everything to be perfect... I think what set me off was the fact that both of them acted like I was just being dramatic ... as if i don't have valid reasons. It hurts. It made me feel like I was being gaslit 

At this point I truly have no option other than to just continue being part of the wedding regardless. I don't want to cause drama my dropping out... not to mention the nearly $300+ dress, shoes, etc. that will have gone to waist if I so drop out. 

Also, yes I do have a therapist, or did. I graduated from therapy this year. Though It's rare now, i do have PTSD episodes sometimes. Last month i randomly saw my rapist in passing. So I've been dealing with my PTSD a lot more lately. Like a couple weeks ago, had a doctors appointment &amp; I literally had a full blown panic attack because being in the room set me off. 
Will definitely be working on my grounding skill for the next month to prepare for the wedding. 

With all that said however... me &amp; my brother's relationship has been on kind of shaky ground for years. It hasn't been till just this year that we have been getting a bit closer. But I think after the wedding... I don't think I can deal with the invalidation from him any more. This isn't the first time he has made me feel like my SA was nothing."

I have several OCD, anxiety, panic disorder, and a slew of other disorders. I have been struggling with my depression for a long time now and try to self delete a few months ago. I am the only one who works in my house. I take care of my 20 yo brother and my husband. I am also the primary care taker of my house. So with work, stress, and depression scrubbing my house is not my priority right now no matter how much anxiety it gives me. 

My husband finally decided to scrub my house clean today. Asked me to go hang out with a friend and come back when he was done. I was so excited. Absolutely overjoyed. When I came home the house was half way clean and that's ok. I didn't expect every room to be spotless in three hours. It felt good to walk in and smell candles lit for the first time in months. 

This is where I start to get upset though. My husband had taken the cow hide rug I have under the dining table to wash it in the washer. He took the TV out of the living room and put it in the bedroom. He said it was so we could lay down and cuddle. I thought that was kind and I was ok with that. When I went to our room, he threw out a rug that i spent a pretty penny on, shoved the bed all the way in the corner, used our night stands as a TV stand. When I went in my step child's room everything had been shoved in there. I started freaking out and asked him a whole bunch of questions. He told me that I'm ungrateful and this is why he doesn't help me.  He told me to leave him alone and to go away. I tried to tell him that I love how clean everything is, but I don't like how it's arranged. He said if I wanted it cleaned then I should have done it. He hasn't cleaned in months and the only reason it stays clean is because of me. 

After I had a full anxiety attack and I heard him and my brother saying I'm ungrateful, controlling, and shitty. He told me he is a prisoner in his own house and now I just feel horrible. I take care of everything and I don't get help. I am excited about the house being clean, but I'm not ready for huge changes without knowing. And the name calling really hurt. 

TL:DR I have anxiety and ocd. My husband cleaned and rearranged the whole house. I was happy the house was clean but not rearranged. My husband started saying really mean things and now I feel horrible."

I feel like he is being childish, and that it shouldnt matter. AITA for telling him that my mom and her new BF have been together for 3 years now, and is a part of my babies life. I told him to unfollow me if the photos make him uncomfortable. 1) it is my account 2) it is my child 3) i feel like that is the same as to stop asking me to post pictures of my friends with my kid, because they aren't family = just doesnt make sense to me."
whdnmj_1516,whdnmj,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Ex husband and I were together for 8.5 years, married for 15 months. We had 2 children together, daughter, 13 years old and son, 7 years old. Ex husband and I have been now separated/divorced for over 7 years.

For the past 7-8 years, ex has been MIA from our kids lives. Combination of him being in a volatile relationship that ended badly, ongoing mental health issues including addiction, and also having a violent temper.

A year ago, my BIL was able to get in contact with ex. My BIL explained that ex husband is now sober, coherent and desperate to reunited with the kids again. I agreed to make arrangements with obviously guidelines to his visitation. I did personally inform my ex about a week before the mini reunion, that I would have no hesitation in ceasing contact between him and the children if he started showing signs of poor and inconsistent parenting (his unwillingness to put in the time and effort that our kids deserve)

For the first 6 months, I could not fault my ex husband on his commitment to our children. Our eldest daughter was gradually warming up to the idea of her father being around, calling her and generally being interested in her life. Our son was soo happy that he finally got to meet his dad (son was too young to remember his father)

6 months ago, ex husband gets himself a GF. She's lovely. She met the kids and they both liked her. But the novelty of our kids had already started to wear off for my ex. Since meeting the new GF, ex husband has been putting less and less effort into our kids. Any plans organised for ex and kids to spend time together went from being a regular fortnightly deal to, always being cancelled - our daughter no longer believes or can takes her father seriously cause ex husbands promises will consistantly fall through. Video calls went from 5-6 times a week, 45 minutes to an hour per call, to 1-2 phone calls every 2-3 weeks, for maximum 15-20 minutes if the kids are lucky. A quick 1-2 minute call just to check in became the new normal quite fast.

Son had asked if his dad was going to call after not hearing from him for over 2 weeks. I tried to call him. Multiple times. Over the next 3 days, I tried calling with no answer. I sent a scathing message to ex husband telling can't believe that it's only took 6 months, after 5 years of being away from his kids, for the novelty to wear off. All efforts on his part, in regards to organising visits to spend quality time with our kids, have all but seem to have basically dried up. And that now since he's getting his dick wet, our kids are no longer a priority to him. And if this is how its going to be with him, what was the fucking point in putting the kids through his pisswarm mediocre BS.

3 days later, ex husband replies calling me every name under the sun. He states that the kids can call him every now and then, and check in with him. And that the kids need to learn to make some effort with him too. He also believes that I'm jealous of him and his relationship with new GF (I'm not jealous. I'm 35F. Ex husband is 48M and new GF is 50F. I'm a lot younger then both of them. And due to his extensive drug use, ex has now missing teeth! I am not jealous of that snaggletooth mofo!!) But top all of that off, ex also informed me, that he doesn't believe our son is his biological child, that he demands a paternity test and that I need to pay for it.

I told my ex husband to go F himself. How dare he make such an outrageous accusation against me when I am fighting for the rights of our kids to have a responsible father in their life. That I've supported him and helped respectfully encourage our kids to participate his the efforts. If he doesn't believe our son is his after all this time, then he no longer needs to be part of our son's life. If in the future, when our son is between 14-16 yrs old and wants to seek his father out, I would of course, support my son in reconnecting with him. But until that point in time, I am officially blocking ex husband and will not subjected my son to his maliciousness.

AITA???

Our 13 yr old daughter has her own phone. She is able to contact her father at anytime and vice versa. Ex doesn't call our daughter anymore. She doesn't call him either. I've asked her to at least attempt to call him - put in that ""effort"". Daughter respectfully told me to mind my own business when it comes to her wanting to speak to her dad. And that she wont be developing ""daddy issues"" anytime soon...cause I'm raising her and her little brother right.

P. S.
Just thought I should add the fact... I actually went and paid for a home paternity test (which included a DNA sample kit being sent to ex husband too) and paid extra to ensure that the results had legal standing to be admissible in any court proceedings. That just meant, that the samples had to be collected and witnessed by a medical professional. So, I just made an appointment with my local gp, took my kids, explained what I wanted, doctor took swab samples, filled out and signed forms and the health clinic posted back the results to the lab. I then go pick up my results from the doctor when the lab notifies me that results are in and have been sent. When I told my BIL, he just blankly stared at me for a few seconds, then started pissing himself laughing. Hard. Tears almost. And with the biggest hug, called me the pettiest bitch he's ever met!! I'll take it!!"

So this actually happened a long time ago but sometimes I think about it and want to know if I’m the AH. So for context I was married and we were going through a rough patch and then I got into a really bad accident. 
While recuperating from my accident I get a message from a girl let’s call her Beth asking me if I was still married to my husband let’s call him Steve. I found it weird as the message was coming through well after reasonable hours (think 2am) and it was just strange in general. Instead of answering her directly I asked why and she proceeded to tell me all about how they were in a relationship and he told her we weren’t together anymore. I mean he even went as far as to say I was just his best friends girl who was staying with him (I don’t understand the logic). I asked her to provide me with screenshots and they dated back at least a month. I told her she clearly didn’t care if I was still married seeing as she waited so long to come to me and she was clearly just upset he hadn’t been answering because he was taking care of me. She then blocked me which was whatever. I then calmly walked across the hall (I was sleeping in a separate room as not to wake him from the pain I was in) and woke him up. I told him very calmly “your gf messaged me… you should call her she’s worried” he looked confused and said he had no idea what I was talking about so I repeated “your gf Beth… she called you should call her back. You know since you love her and we wouldn’t want the woman you love to worry”. All the color flooded from his face and the dramatics started he started telling me it meant nothing, he just needed an escape, he never loved her. But by then I had checked out I had read the messages and even if it was just an escape he escaped into the arms of another woman. I literally just stared at him. Not saying a word just blinking. And he got angrier and angrier yelling plus some extra things that were completely unnecessary in my opinion so I asked “did that make you feel better or something cause it seems very dramatic to me” he got pissed and told me I was a heartless b-word who never loved him because I wouldn’t even fight for our relationship. I told him I wasn’t about to fight someone for something that clearly wasn’t only mine and he told me I was being a childish AH and I needed to talk to him about it. I said nothing and went back into the other room and went to sleep for the next two or so weeks I said nothing more than “can you get me my meds and a glass of water” and he almost lost his mind.

I’m starting 8th grade this year, and my two other years of middle school, I spent them online, mainly because of the pandemic but also because of family issues at home. So this year, my first year of middle school, I didn’t know how to work a locker. A few days ago we went to my open house at my school and they taught us how to use lockers, the lockers were a little hard to open no doubt but I got it down. After opening my locker 4 times already with no instructions I felt like I was okay and didn’t feel need to use it again so, my locker being on the ground, I stood back up and tried walking to my next class hinting to my family to follow them. Before I could leave my mom stopped me and tried telling me to open it again so I could get used to it. I told her that I didn’t want to do that, and she tried convincing me again. For the sake of not wanting to argue with her, in annoyance I went to open it again, but she already stormed off and told me to do whatever I want and that she doesn’t care. We stayed at my school for about thirty minutes, wrapping up and meeting more teachers until it was time to go home. My mom wasn’t following us at all, just wandering wherever. When we got home she ignored me for the rest of the day, and eventually I asked her what was wrong, she told me that I never care about her and make her feel useless, mind you I love my mom and I’ve actually been involving her in many of my school shopping and personal life, and I haven’t seen anything wrong. She blew up in my face told me that she hated me as a daughter and wish she never had me, and that she only loves my two sisters and doesn’t claim me as a daughter, me, obviously shocked at this point was confused, until my dad stood up for me and tried telling her that it wasnt my fault I didn’t wanna open the locker for the fifth time, and that I had other classes to go to (since the open house was almost done), my mom looked like she was about to actually explode, and she screamed louder than I’ve ever heard her scream at my dad and me, grabbed my sister by the arm and told her to help her pack up her stuff because she’s moving out, and that since me and my dad think alike so much that we should live alone together. Me and my dad were obviously shocked at this. My mom proceeded to take all of my school stuff and said she’s gonna sell them online for money, for her new house and that I need to find some other way to get supplies. My dad and I have been sleeping in my small room, he has an air bed and I have my usual twin bed. It’s been hard but we’re getting through it, I feel bad for my dad, considering he is going to be raising me now. What do you guys think? Am I really the asshole in this?"

wielcu_1542,wielcu,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So I 25 Female got recently married to my husband 27 male we didn’t have a very big event but everything was beautiful and just how I had envisioned it except we had a pretty major problem. My dad 54 male got married to his now wife 48 Female years back when my mom had passed away, me and his wife had never gotten along because no matter what I did she would always put me and her daughter Lucy 21 Female at competition, Example, If Lucy had a band concert while I had a basketball game My dads wife would always pressure my dad to ignore my events and go to Lucy’s instead this caused a lot of fighting in me and Lucy’s relationship. As soon as I turned 18 I moved out to go live with my now husband so I wouldn’t have to deal with those two anymore. Well when I told my dad that I was engaged I starting receiving calls and texts from my his wife and daughter basically telling me “oh we want this color theme” or Lucy telling me she wanted a certain color of bridesmaids dresses because she also wanted to look good at my wedding. This is when me and my husband starting spending more time with them because they kept nagging us to take them everywhere if it had to do with wedding planning. This is when I started noticing that Lucy had become very flirty with my husband and he always seemed uncomfortable, I tried to confront her gently about this but all she did was deny. Now when I told Lucy that she was not going to be a bridesmaid and that she would just be a regular guest at my wedding she flipped out and called me jealous and insecure because I apparently “didn’t want her to outshine me because she would obviously look better than me on my own wedding if she was standing next to me” she cried to my dad and his wife and I constantly got calls from my dads wife angrily yelling at me to let Lucy be a bridesmaid and asking if “I don’t want a sisterly relationship with her” this is when I snapped and told them they can either be guests or be uninvited to the wedding so that shut them up about that but I would still get snarky comments here and there. Fast forward to the day of my wedding. In the middle of my dad giving a speech I notice his wife and Lucy giggling and getting up to use the bathroom about halfway through my dads speech she and Lucy come out of the bathroom smiling ear to ear wearing long white extravagant dresses everyone was shocked and I felt the anger in me rise, they had the audacity to come up to me and say “Sorry we spilled wine on our dresses and had to change, hope you don’t mind”. Lucy went up to my husband and literally told him infront of me that if things don’t work out between him and I that she was available, my husband instantly pushed her away and told her to get away from him Lucy looked so embarrassed but that didn’t stop me from yelling at her and her mom to get the fuck out of my wedding and never contact me again this is when my dad said to not be so harsh on them and that they had to change because they weren’t going to walk around in stained dresses this is when I started yelling at him too and reminding him of all the times he took their side instead of mine all three of them were kicked out and now I’m receiving messages from my side of the family saying I overreacted and that my dad was right about the fact that they shouldn’t have to walk around in stained dresses and that I’m an asshole who took things too far by kicking them out but my husbands side is saying that I was completely in the right and they were out of line, but I’m torn I don’t know, maybe I did take things too far by kicking them out, Am I the asshole?"

About a week ago I went on a family vacation and put a camera up in my room so I could check on things while i’m gone. For context I live in a horrible neighborhood that has had a few shootings this year and one was just a few weeks ago. My roommate saw the camera before I left and didn’t say anything about it but I saw her looking at it. A few days into my trip I check my camera and see a video of her walking straight into my room and putting the camera down so I can only see the ceiling. I call her and ask why she put it down and if she can put it back up. She hangs up on me and doesn’t reply to any of my texts. A few hours later she puts my camera back up. I call her that night and she is mad saying I was interrupting a work call and that she didn’t feel good. I told her I was sorry for interrupting her call and if she would have told me she was on a work call before she hung up abruptly I wouldn’t have been texting her. She also said she was mad I was using a shared camera in my room which I understood even though she never uses it anyways. So I ordered my own little camera for my room. When it came in the mail she seemed very weird about it and was asking me to tell her if I have it on in my room. I’m starting to think she is doing something in my room when i’m not here because she is so concerned about my camera. I told her I would never put a camera in a shared space and I wouldn’t care if she got one in her room and gave her multiple reasons why I wanted a camera in my room. That night I leave to spend the night at a friends house and on my way out she asks me if my camera is up, I tell her yes and she starts freaking out on me. Blowing my phone up with texts and calls asking if it records sound and just being super sketchy. She is trying to turn it around on me saying I don’t trust her and i’m lying about the reasons for my camera. At first the camera had nothing to do with her and it was just to make me feel safer in my own bedroom. But now I am starting to get worried she is doing something in my room because I don’t see why it is this big of a deal since she shouldn’t really be in my bedroom anyways. She started saying if I want to move out just to be honest and calling me a liar and all these horrible things putting words into my mouth. The camera does not record sound and I told her I would keep my door shut at all times since she is so uncomfortable about it. However she is still pissed and defensive thinking i’m in the wrong. She is even calling a bunch of her family and friends and telling them how weird I am for having a camera in my room. She says being on camera makes her uncomfortable but she was fine with the outside camera on our front door and a previous one in our hallway on our bunnies. I’m not sure what to do at this point.. am I in the wrong? I honestly didn’t really care about having the camera at first but after seeing her reaction to me having it in my room I feel I really do need it. Am I being crazy?"

I told them no because I want to open my own business and they got defensive and then decided to drop the subject. My mom is your stereo typical narcissistIc parent and my dad just agrees with her no matter what the situation.

I didn’t think it could have gotten worse when they DEMANDED I buy them 2 houses since they “deserved it”. Even close family friends tell them how crazy they’re being. The other day I finally snapped and told them if they keep it up I won’t keep in contact when I’m 18, my mom started bawling saying who would help her when she’s older, I told her that she was acting ridiculous and I stormed out of the house and went for a drive to blow off some steam.

During the holidays, she had to go back to her parent’s house in another country for 2 months and a half. She gave me her keys so i could stay in her studio (because i don’t have a place of my own, i’m in the military so there’s either in the dorms or at my mom’s place). She was kind enough to give me her keys, she didn’t ask for any money to pay the bills (i didn’t offer also ) and she also gave me her mom’s laptop so that i could start my small business. 

However everything has gone down hill and i don’t know who is at fault…
She came home from her parent’s house friday. But before that on wednesday I told her that i was supposed to go sleep over at a friend’s house, and that i was supposed to stay there until friday, but I decided i would be home on thursday night, the day before she was supposed to come back.
She answered « well yeah especialy cuz i’ll be here friday morning 😂 ! » which i already knew. I told her that it was not for her that I shortened my stay at my friend’s house, i quote : « Don’t imagine that I organize my plans around you ». She answered that it’s not what she meant, but because we hadn’t seen each other in 2 months and a half it was rude to say that and that it is normal for her to expect me to be there when she arrives. And even if i cancelled my stay on friday because of another reason than her i shouldn’t have told her that she doesn’t matter in my process of making plans…
So thé conversation got heated and i callee her too dramatic, easily offended and a psychorigid. 
She told me she was disappointed by my reaction and by the things i told her. She tried to talk to me to get me to understand but i told her i would never apologize cuz i had no bad intention, and because it didn’t mean that i am not looking forward to see her.
So she was cold from thursday to friday and when she came from the airport on friday she was visibly colder than usual. 
She told me that we should talk about it and i just got mad and told her that it was really inappropriate for her to be mad the day that we see eachother after 2,5 months. She told me that she was mad because i didn’t even offer to pick her up from the airport and she had to pay an uber for herself, and because there wasn’t any food in the house. I told her that i was supposed to go out after she arrived to buy her flowers and buy food but she ruined everything by coming in mad and wanting to talk about something so insignificant. Anyways it really got heated and i said some rude things but she was kind of getting my heated for nothing.
I simply don’t get why she’s mad since i had no bad intentions and already told her i won’t apologize.
Sorry for my crooked english lol
TL;DR: my girlfriend in mad at me because i told her that i do not plan my life around her"

She was kind enough to give me her keys, she didn’t ask for any money to pay the bills (i didn’t offer also ) and she also gave me her mom’s laptop so that i could start my small business. 

However everything has gone down hill and i don’t know who is at fault…
She came home from her parent’s house friday. But before that on wednesday I told her that i was supposed to go sleep over at a friend’s house, and that i was supposed to stay there until friday, but I decided i would be home on thursday night, the day before she was supposed to come back.
She answered « well yeah especialy cuz i’ll be here friday morning 😂 ! » which i already knew. I told her that it was not for her that I shortened my stay at my friend’s house, i quote : « Don’t imagine that I organize my plans around you ». She answered that it’s not what she meant, but because we hadn’t seen each other in 2 months and a half it was rude to say that and that it is normal for her to expect me to be there when she arrives. And even if i cancelled my stay on friday because of another reason than her i shouldn’t have told her that she doesn’t matter in my process of making plans…
So thé conversation got heated and i callee her too dramatic, easily offended and a psychorigid. 
She told me she was disappointed by my reaction and by the things i told her. She tried to talk to me to get me to understand but i told her i would never apologize cuz i had no bad intention, and because it didn’t mean that i am not looking forward to see her.
So she was cold from thursday to friday and when she came from the airport on friday she was visibly colder than usual. 
She told me that we should talk about it and i just got mad and told her that it was really inappropriate for her to be mad the day that we see eachother after 2,5 months. She told me that she was mad because i didn’t even offer to pick her up from the airport and she had to pay an uber for herself, and because there wasn’t any food in the house. I told her that i was supposed to go out after she arrived to buy her flowers and buy food but she ruined everything by coming in mad and wanting to talk about something so insignificant. Anyways it really got heated and i said some rude things but she was kind of getting my heated for nothing.
I simply don’t get why she’s mad since i had no bad intentions and already told her i won’t apologize.
Sorry for my crooked english lol
TL;DR: my girlfriend in mad at me because i told her that i do not plan my life around her"
wjgb6z_1574,wjgb6z,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,"I (23 F) have been married to my husband (25 M) for two years. We bond over so much and we both come from similar ethnic backgrounds. Everyday before work he makes me breakfast in bed and puts notes with my lunch. I truly adore him, he makes me feel happy and like I actually matter to him. He's so loving it breaks my heart to tell this story. So about a week ago my cousin got married and had her baby boy a few days after. I'm not a huge fan of kids, I grew up with only my younger sister but I knew from a young age I woud'nt ever have kids. At least not any of my own. In general I wanted to be free to have fun and not worry about a child who needs love, food, water and loads more. Just one child is too much for me. But on the other hand my husband adores kids and would love one of his own. He has never asked me if I've wanted one or if we could have one but after visting my cousin and her baby my husband starting dropping hints. For example he made a cake with blue and pink with a baby angel on top and served it to me after dinner. I feel so guilty. I wish I wanted a child so we both could be happy. But I have a feeling things our going to start going downhill now that my husband knows I don't ever want a child. He's been trying so hard to persuade me and change my mind but nothing so far has worked. Just a day ago we got into a huge argument about it. I told him if kept bugging me about this I'd divorce him (Which will end up happening I'm pretty sure) But he just won't give up. I feel like I should toughen up and accept that having a child might bring some fun to my life. At least that's what my sister and parents say.  They called me selfish and say I'm ruining my relationship with my husband. I honestly don't know anymore. AITAH??"
wjrzvf_1580,wjrzvf,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"My mother [56F] and I [20F] do not have a good relationship. We haven't gotten along since I was about 7 years old and she let me cry for hours about how I didn't understand why she spent more time with my cousin inside than with me outside playing.

For background I was/am a daddy's girl. I love my dad, followed him around and did all the fun things with him. He never really cared what gender I was (I'm adopted) but I was more of a tomboy as a kid. Still am, but I digress. I played baseball and football and loved just getting absolutely filthy with my friends. 

My mother wanted someone easy to dress up and show off their talents. I was, and am the golden child of the family, I did everything and was good at everything, but I didn't focus on what others thought. As a kid that wasn't really my priority, so she favored her niece over me my entire childhood until her niece decided she wasn't ever going to come over again, and she was stuck with me; the 'easter egg' the 'talented physical disappointment' the 'I can berate her at home and talk highly of her to my friends.'  So she tried to firce me into dresses and skirts, but I hated it and she gave up, and we never built a good relationship. She's always been jealous of my dad and I's relationship.

She made it very clear from when I was young that she did not care about me as a person so long as I did what I was told and kept her happy I was a good child. Thing is I only do things when asked and I will not do something I was ordered to do, because I am a person not a slave and shall be treated as such.

Onto the issue at hand, today I had plans to go to the beach with my boyfriend [19M], and when I went to pack my dads cooler (that he said I could use since its significantly bigger than mine) and I had frozen two water bottles last night so they stay cold for today, but when I went to grab them… gone. No big deal, she had two other frozen ones so I took those and replaced them with two new ones since I was leaving soon.

Fast forward to after the beach we're on our way home and I get a text from my mother, and our conversation went like this:

""Bring water home"" -Mother

""We're not driving by any stores, there's two new waters in the freezer for you since ya stole mine this morning, we'll get water tomorrow since i'm going out"" -Me

""What are you talking about, I stole?? You can go to the store and get water!!! Dollar general is NOT out of your way, and I'm glad your father can see how you talk to me here."" -mother

Ok one the store she's talking about was quite literally 16 miles out of the way we were driving to get home. She would've been fine if we didn't buy water until tomorrow. Two, I didn't care that she took the water. It's not an issue, what was an issue is how she went looking for a fight where there wasn't one to be had because she was in a bad mood. So i decided not to even entertain that with a response.

So I got home after doing what she so kindly demanded that I buy water for her. She starts going in on me. 

""You say I stole your water but you took mine,"" she said. I stayed silent. I wasn't doing this, I was having a good day.  ""What nothing to say?"" Still silence ""that's what I thought.""

Now here comes the part where I might be an asshole.

""No I'm just not entertaining this, this conversation is f-ing stupid, and I don't need to have it,"" I said finishing washing the cooler insert and putting it in the drying rack.

""Who do you think you are talking to me like that?!?! I am your mother, you ungrateful brat!"" She yells.

""No, you're not. You are someone that treats me like garbage so you can go argue with yourself in the mirror because I refuse to entertain your bullshit any further,"" I said and I walked away.

She now refuses to talk to me because I won't apologize for 'back-talking'. However, I don't think i did anything wrong, maybe I could have worded it better but still. I don't owe her anything. I was a choice she made. Just because she wasn't happy with her choice doesn't mean I should get treated like a piece of shit because of it, but maybe I am the asshole, but i dont feel i owe her an apology. I feel she deserved it.

So AITA for telling my mother to go fight with herself in the mirror because I'm no longer entertaining her bullshit?"
wk30oc_1585,wk30oc,op-engaged,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I 24F and my husband 24M have been together for three years now, Married for two tomorrow. We fight over several things, his dad being one of them. When we got together, I didn’t know the full extent of the story of him and his dad, but apparently everywhere my husband has lived or went, his dad has followed. I didn’t have a problem with this until me and my husband got our own place as we used to live with close friends. 

His dad was over ever day, and I didn’t mind it as he only stayed a couple hours a day to see the grandkids, two from my previous marriage and one from me and my current husband. But it got to a point where he would stay for more than that and up until my husband got home from work, until after dinner. It got to the point when I asked my husband to let his dad know that I needed a break, or if he would text and want to come over for the day, I would tell him I didn’t feel like having company. He respected this for a little while, but it didn’t last long as when me and my husband moved again, to a bigger place as before we lived in a tiny apartment, and my husband wanted a place for his dad to park his camper and live outside our house. I was against this as I knew the things would probably escalate quickly.

My husband explained to me that it would only be temporary until his dad got his camper fixed up the way he wanted it and remodeled it then he said that his dad would go to a campsite and camp out there and only come over like he used to at the apartment. Needless to say this is not what happened, he worked on it and remodeled it a little bit but then he just stayed. 

Flash forward a couple months and they invited his mom to come stay for a little while which I was fine with because his mom gives us our space and knows her boundaries with us. Well she came and stayed and soon after that he took her back home, his dad that is, so after his dad got back he started being disrespectful. Keep in mind that now he lives in our back yard, he’s been over literally everyday almost all day and it a bit more than I can handle. So, my husband‘s work is a little difficult and I wanted to go ride with him to go see what was going on, which I was allowed to do and his dad blatantly and disrespectfully looks at me and says, “Just leave it the fuck alone and stay out of it.” My husband said nothing, and I got upset and just went to our room. And in another incident, me and my husband were having a tiny argument at the dinner table, because our 4 year old, is Autistic and my husband hadn’t even given the doctor a chance to see him yet, that’s what the argument was about. My father-in-law, then raised his voice at me, and rudely says, “He’s being difficult about it so just shut the hell up!” To which, I being passive, just stopped eating, stood up, and went to our room. 

This stuff has been going on so long and finally I’m fed up with it so I asked my husband to set boundaries and to start standing up for me because he hadn’t previously. I explained to him that he had said that his dad would not be here any longer but long enough to fix up his camper and then he would go to a campsite and go back to the way it was at the apartment. I also explained to my husband that I was not going to be disrespected in my own house. My husband blew up and said that his dad overrides  me that his dad could stay as long as he wanted to so much to the point that now that we’re getting our own land, keep in mind we are still actively arguing over this, that after we got our own land his dad would have a spot on the land. I’m just so fed up with not having any privacy and his dad being right here all the time, everyday all day. 
Side note, he did stand up for me once because I got a nose ring and his dad called to complain and My husband  told him it it was none of his business, and that he had told me to get it, but other than that, we are still arguing and he’s still refuses to tell his dad that it’s our life and he needs to give us space, so we’re still fighting….. so, AITA?


Update: 
Our Anniversary was the shittiest I’ve ever had. Husband and I woke up pretty happy. He had something to do, and we were gonna take the kiddos because that’s just how we do. Husband went out to the car to move car seats, and surprise, surprise FIL comes out and automatically comes in the house. 🤦🏽‍♀️ That already put me in a mood, because I was like, “Really, it’s our Anniversary,” and he knew how bad I wanted it to just be us. And FIL knew this as well. I ignored it at first as I was being civil, and knowing that me and my husband had already had the discussion yesterday (Tuesday) about his dad leaving, and my husband said he was just thinking of how to bring it up to him. We got in the car, and he asked me what the real issue was and I tried to explain that I resent his dad because of the blatant disrespect and no privacy. My husband then said, he didn’t see it as disrespectful. I was floored. How did he not see his dad yelling at me and cussing at me in our own home as disrespectful? We stopped talking for the majority of the car ride. When he was done and we were headed back home, he told me that no matter what he does, I will never be happy and that he had to give up everything for me and I still wasn’t happy. This isn’t true as I never said, “You can’t do that.” Not even once to him in our whole three years together. I always gave him to option and told him I would support him, so I straight up told him when we got home, me and my kids were leaving. To which he replied that no, we weren’t. I didn’t understand what he meant, but when we got home…..

This boy, threw me under the bus and made me the bad guy to his dad. He made the decision to go out there to his dad, and tell him to leave, then came back in and told me that if something happened to his dad, then I was to blame. Needless to say, his dad didn’t leave, and I’m just biding my time to save money and get the fuck outta here. 
Although he did set a few boundaries by telling his dad not to be in our house all the time and to ask if I was okay with it, but I don’t think things are going to get any better….and now it’s a waiting game. I’m so frustrated and upset, and Looking back, I know my husband used a narcissistic tactic on me, so wish me luck people!"

My husband (32M) and I (25f) have a ten month old. After my maternity leave, I started wfh full time and tended to the baby. I opted for part time college as well. husband has his own line of work (he can opt for flexible schedule). So while I was juggling with full-time wfh job and part time online college(online classes), I was taking care of the baby as well since we couldn’t afford daycare. 
Soon, I would have to go back to college for on-site classes. I spoke with my husband and asked about daycare options. I would have to either quit my job or do part time. I already cover my expenses (health insurance, car expenses, fuel etc) and contribute a little bit in the house (groceries etc) Husband pays the rest (groceries, his car, shared rent and bills, and baby’s food diapers etc). Now he says me going to college/working wouldn’t benefit him in any way since according to him whatever I earn, I use it on myself. So he wants me to quit my job all together, and take care of the baby. If he has to help in any way, he might as well have me stay at home (quit working at all) and rather take care of my personal expenses, than have me study, work, get a job or pursue a career. According to him money for daycare is a waste and he’d rather have me be a SAHM. I’ve technically been a SAHM for the past ten months and wfh full time but at some point I’ll have to get out.

Backstory, my boyfriend (50m) and I (45f) have been together a little over 1.5 years. Last Christmas my sister presented our family w/ a family vacation to be taken in August. My sister was paying for the airfare and Airbnb for everyone, 11 people in our family and extended the invite to my bf and his daughter. 
My bf accepted this gift. He has been out of work since May and hasn’t even really tried looking for a job. I picked up an additional job as well as additional shifts over the last 7 months to have extra money to pay for me and my sons food and activities while on vacation. During this time I told my bf that we should not expect or even allow my sister to pay for anything else while on the vacation and to make sure he had money for him and his daughter. He said he did from his savings/investment account. 
Fast forward, we arrive at the airport and he and his daughter check in without waiting for our whole group. He gambles on the slots at the airport bar and wins $100. He doesnt buy a round of drinks but instead accepts 2 rounds of drinks my sister bought. We take our flight and arrive at our destination where my sister had food delivered for all of us. The adults in the group then decide to walk to a local bar and he immediately orders himself a drink and pays for it and finds a slot machine to gamble on. He loses on the slots. He comes back and again accepts drinks that others including myself and my sister bought. 
This type of thing continues throughout the whole week vacation with groceries for the house, drinks and dinners out. In addition my sister made reservations for the group at his request to go to a museum for the entire group and he never even offers to pay for himself and his daughter (tix were $30-$40 a piece). 
We as a group (10 of us total) decide to go parasailing ($125 per person) and again my sister makes the reservation and puts her credit card out. The bf makes no mention or offer to pay for him or his daughter. 
He does however pay for breakfast one morning for a few in the group as well as a round of drinks during one group outing. All week long he posts pictures on FB of him and his daughter (only) and never once tags anyone in my family including me. He also made a reservation to take his daughter to Disney since we were staying 1.5 hours away. He paid for those tix and He rented a car specifically to drive to Disney. 
Upon arrival back home from vacay he grabs his luggage and goes to leave without even saying thank you. When I suggest he wait for the rest of my family, his daughter begins to whine about why they have to wait. I said it would only be right to at least thank the people that gave you your whole week long trip. 
I’m disappointed and disgusted with his selfish and cheap behavior. Should I ask him for money to pay my sister back for at least the muses I’m and parasailing? Should I dump him and if so should I tell him about himself or just walk away??"

Backstory, my boyfriend (50m) and I (45f) have been together a little over 1.5 years. Last Christmas my sister presented our family w/ a family vacation to be taken in August. My sister was paying for the airfare and Airbnb for everyone, 11 people in our family and extended the invite to my bf and his daughter. 
My bf accepted this gift. He has been out of work since May and hasn’t even really tried looking for a job. I picked up an additional job as well as additional shifts over the last 7 months to have extra money to pay for me and my sons food and activities while on vacation. During this time I told my bf that we should not expect or even allow my sister to pay for anything else while on the vacation and to make sure he had money for him and his daughter. He said he did from his savings/investment account.

I 48f have two daughters 15f and 13f my 15 yo thinks she’s “not like other girls” and goes out of her way to put her sister down for being more feminine. When my 15yo talks it’s like hearing nails on a chalkboard.

My 13yo is sweet and smart and beautiful, she’s very popular in her class while my 15 yo only has guy friends. I really don’t enjoy her company and sometimes I wish I had just had my 13yo.

My kids fight a lot because of the 15 yo difficult personality so I usually take 13 yo side. Last week my 15 yo was talking about a man named Andrew Tate? She said all her f friends were listening to him and that I should too. My 13 yo who apparently knew who he was started screaming at her because apparently he’s a terrible person. I looked him up and I was disgusted and grounded my older daughter for two weeks.

She thinks just talking about him wasn’t worth the punishment but I know she looks up to him and agrees with his disturbing ideas. I’m going to have a long talk with her about this but right now I’m disgusted and I can’t look her in the eye.

My husband thinks I’m an AH and I’ve always favored the 13yo. So AITAH for punishing her?

EDIT: There are two things I want to apologize for: have some unaddressed childhood trauma that I wasn’t properly managing. I’m going to figure out how to fix things with my daughter. Some of the things in this post were said out of anger and I regret them. Also if you had not heard of Andrew Tate, I sincerely apologize for you exposing him to you. He is a disgusting human being not worth an ounce of your time."

wlfeba_1633,wlfeba,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I (F, 19) have a younger sister (16) who I truly love a lot and would do anything for. 

I’ve always been told how pretty I was from a young age, so my parents put me in parents and got me modeling jobs. My sister was more of a couch potato.


Well, from these pagents I get prize money. While I was in college I continued doing pagents and saved up a lot of a money. 


Well, one day I got a call from my parents saying that my sister was just informed that her boyfriend was dying. My sister fell into a deep depression and I felt heart broken for her. 


I flew over as fast as I could and when I got home my sister was a mess. She vented to me about her boyfriend who she loves so much and how heart broken they both are, I would be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear to two.



Why venting to me she told me one thing he’s always wanted to to was go to prom. That’s when I got an idea to plan an amazing prom night for my sister and her boyfriend.


I told her that I would make his dream come true and she hugged me and cried even more. I went in my computer and set up an expensive photo shoot, as long as a limo to drop off and pick up my sister from the prom. 


I also found a lady who was able to make a beautiful blue dress and a matching Tux, blue was their favorite color. 


I got everything arranged and the lady started making the dress and suit. I was over the moon to see my sister happy. 


Well the following week, I went to another pageant which was really big and I won. The win came with a tiara, a sash, and alot of money. 


When I got home I immediately went into my sisters room to tell her about my win. 


She blew up at me after I told her and said quote “I don’t care about your stupid pagent gifts, you don’t have to rub it in my face. Get out of my room.” 



I was hurt and got out of her room. My hurt turned to anger because after all I flew from college and spent my hard earned money to set up her dream prom.


Well, in that state of rage, I went to my computer and cancelled the dress and suit, the venue for them to take pictures, and the limo. 



At dinner that night, my sister brought up how thankful she was for me doing what I did and I told her that I cancelled everything after what she said. 


Her face dropped as she started crying and ran to her room saying “I hate you”.


My parents were shocked and called me an asshole because her boyfriend was dying an she already told him about the prom.



I felt really bad and left the dinner table to see if I could get everything back, but it wouldn’t be ready in time and the person who was making my sisters dress and suit blocked me.



So now, her prom is a week away and she had to tell her boyfriend about what I did and he was totally heart broken because this was the only thing he could do with his girlfriend before he passed away.


I’ve gotten called from family members and my sister friends calling me an asshol. My parents also kicked me out and I’ve been staying with my bestfriend.


My parents said my sister is depressed and was just having a bad day and I shouldn’t have done that especially with the fact this is something her dying boyfriend wanted to do and they can’t find anybody else to find a outfit for them, so AITA?"

wlgodl_1640,wlgodl,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"My (23F) boyfriend (24M) is obsessed with his dog. I know that it sounds a little insane to be jealous of a dog but please hear me out. 

My boyfriend and I met over a year ago at bar and started dating soon after. One of the main things that he would talk about was his dog, Bones. I actually met Bones on our first date, which was taking him to the dog park! He was so adorable and sweet that I instantly fell in love with him! 

However, I soon began to have a few problems with Bones. For instance, the first time my boyfriend and I were started being intimate, Bones was in the bed. I asked my boyfriend to put him in his living room. My boyfriend “didn’t see the problem with him being in the room”. After I expressed my discomfort, he brought him to the couch and made sure that he “gave him lots of pets” before coming back to bed. Afterwards, all he could talk about was how he could hear him outside the door the entire time we were having sex. 

Another issue arose when he would leave my family events early because he “wanted to check on Bones” or “was worried about Bones”. Eventually, I was able to secure Bones an invite to certain parties because I really wanted my boyfriend to stay longer and be with my family. Wrong decision. Now, he will barely converse with anyone in my family and stare at the dog the entire time. In addition, he will get onto the floor and hold him for long periods of time. I find it uncomfortable when my boyfriend does this. I understand that he loves Bones, but laying on the ground to spoon him in front of my family has to be a step over the line. (Side Note: Bones is not an emotional support dog)

I could talk about how he cuddles the dog more than me, lets the dog sleep between us at night, gives the dog long kisses on the forehead, gives him more attention than me even though he has been with him all day, etc. However, I don’t want to make the post too long.

I have had two dogs in the past so I understand loving your pet. I just think that you should treat your partner as an equal in your relationship, not give your dog the better treatment.

I want to have a conversation with him about Bones but I don’t want to hurt his feelings or ruin our relationship. Please let me know if you think I’m the asshole and I would love to have a respectful conversation to hear about what I could be doing better."

I asked her what it was about and she said ""he should know"" so I dropped it.

SO picked her up Friday after work. We took her and my 2 kids to the movies, bowling, the zoo, the arcade, went out to eat, baked a couple of pies and 3 types of cookies together this weekend. All things she (and my kids) *usually* enjoy doing.

I'm an Asian American college student (21F) that lives in the US. I grew up in Asia, so I was pretty used to getting comments about my weight until I moved to the US when I was 14. I've had an eating disorder/bad relationship with body image for a decade now. I was in treatment during the spring semester, which improved my body image and taught me firm boundaries surrounding all that.

I love my mom and family. I value my Asian heritage and cherish it. However, a recent trip to Japan has ruined a lot of it and I'm currently no contact with my mother.

I told her that historically my Japanese family has not been understanding of my eating disorder and has not stopped making awful comments about my body. In the US, I am considered healthy (even thin in some places) and have a healthy BMI (24.5). However, I did gain weight after eating disorder recovery (which is pretty common and not a bad thing). My family went nuts over this.

My mom insisted on going to a professional studio in Japan for a photo shoot in a kimono to celebrate my coming of age (seijinshiki). While getting my hair and makeup done, she started talking about how my body is larger than my sister's and that a kimono would fit differently. I was very firm and told her to stop multiple times. The studio staff and my mom went to another room to discuss whether it was appropriate to keep going after my 'diva fit' (she really said this).

I told her that bulimia can be deadly and that I needed her to take my health seriously. She proceeded to tell me that if it was that bad I would be thinner. My aunt and her isolated me and talked to me about how uncomfortable they were around how aggressive I was being (I was not yelling, I just wanted to establish firm, strict boundaries).

When we got to her hometown, my grandpa saw me and told me I need to lose a couple pounds. They made me adhere to a strict diet of under 600 calories. They even prohibited me from going to my uncle's famous ramen shop that I haven't gone to in years. I couldn't order my own meal at most places, and when I complained that I was hungry they told me it wouldn't hurt to skip a meal because 'I'd had a big breakfast'. I snuck out to buy rice balls at the convenience store to keep me satiated. I hid this from my family because I knew it would upset them.

When the kimono pictures were received, I was told over and over again that I looked bad in a kimono and that they were worried I would end up fat and die young like many Americans. ""When a person becomes fat, they rot as humans."" is what my grandpa told me before he forcefully made me hike to lose weight. The pictures spread through the town and it seemed to be the ongoing joke the whole time I was there. 

My uncle laughed that I was double the size of his niece and joked he would have to roll out of his office to get me out of the door. He said that I couldn't go to the hot springs because the baths would overflow if I got in them. They told me that no matter how good my grades were, nobody would take a fat girl like me seriously. My aunts would stare at me in horror and tell me about all the plus-sized clothing stores in the area. I am not plus-sized.

The worst part was the dinner party. My relatives scraped their leftovers on my plate so I could finish their meals.

The whole time I firmly told them that I had an illness and that their comments weren't funny and to please stop. I cried for nights. My twin sister, my only advocate on the trip recommended I fly back to the states to escape the horror. My mom stopped us and told her we were ruining her mental health.

All of this sounds like she's definitely the a\*\*hole, right? After a conversation with my older sister, I'm convinced that I'm in the wrong.

She said it's just the culture, that eating disorders aren't well understood in Japan and that I'm being intolerant. She said I was Americanized and that this wouldn't have made me blink an eye when I lived there. Have my ideals gone too far? Am I disrespecting my Asian relatives by being pushy? I want a relationship with these people. I know that how they treated me is the norm in rural Japan. It just hurts so bad.

3 months later, after some enjoyable summer classes and research projects, I haven't been bulimic. I have, however, been on a severe diet (out of habit) and have felt horrible about my body. 

My friends and other family insist that I stop talking to my mom because she doesn't respect me or my needs from a western perspective. From her perspective, she's caring for me and making sure I'm skinny enough to be 'healthy' and that being picked on is just something that happens.

AITAH for being insensitive about my mom's culture and being super angry about all the things that were said to me?"

My friends and other family insist that I stop talking to my mom because she doesn't respect me or my needs from a western perspective. From her perspective, she's caring for me and making sure I'm skinny enough to be 'healthy' and that being picked on is just something that happens.

AITAH for being insensitive about my mom's culture and being super angry about all the things that were said to me?"
wm96b4_1662,wm96b4,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"This is a very long story but I’ll shorten it up. My sibling found out they have herpes about a month back now and has not changed their ways. They’ve been sleeping with 3 people as of last week and has not informed any of them. I have only heard it from family members until about a week ago when we had a pretty heated phone call about a lot of their life choices lately. That’s when they told me. Now it’s been a week and they made one of the 3 his SO “very new from what I can assume* bust still hasn’t informed them so I took it upon myself and sent a message to let them know. And I just want to say they have  no intentions of telling the new SO. They said thanks and have a convo with my sibling but now my sibling is calling me. I haven’t picked up nor do I want to but I know they’ll call my family and I will eventually hear what Is being said about me. 

No one’s called me an asshole but I can’t help but feel a little guilty. I just think the new SO has every right to know what they’re exposing themselves  to no matter what the other person feels like."

He no longer compliments me, and overall just doesn't treat me with respect anymore. Some of the things that he no longer does are the following: Kiss me, hug me, hold the door for me, cuddle with me etc. He just doesn't show physical love, and mental love for that much. I have talked to him about his love language and he said that it is physical touch, however none of that is happening.  I have also wondered if he just isn't in love with me anymore, but if he wasn't then why hasn't he said anything? I deserve to be loved and treated with respect, and if I'm not getting that, then usually I won't hesitate to break up and find someone better. The reason I hesitate now is because I want to know if there could be a way that we could make it work. He used to treat me so much better when we first started dating, and I want to know if it could be like that again. I love him, and I deserve someone who loves me. I have also wondered if he is cheating on me and fell in love with his side chick. I just don't know. I know my worth and I deserve better, but for some reason I hesitate. I have thought about talking to him and I plan to tell him how I feel the next time we meet up. I would like an outside opinion however.

Now I’ve been getting migraines for years it’s not something totally different or shocking. But I have had a sore and itchy throat along with feeling tired and some coughing. My mom has had headaches which she also sometimes gets, but she tested for Covid and came back positive. My mom has had quite a few friends who has had Covid and invited those same people over a week after their quarantine, and I am livid. I have every right to be, she’s been having (and going) too all types of events, without wearing a mask etc. Im just so mad rn out of everyone who has it at my house I am the most affected. I am beyond pissed, I jumped through hoops just too avoid Covid just for my damn mom too give it too me and everyone else. I’ve been giving her the cold shoulder or glaring at her and she doesn’t fully understand why I’m mad. And yes I understand I should call down etc etc but I refuse too not blame her too Atleast a certain extent, maybe if she stayed inside this wouldn’t have happened. But I’m trying my best too stay calm bc I’m not the only one who’s mad at her rn. I’m just really upset so ATIA?

Edit 1: for those of you who keep saying too get vaccinated I am vaccinated I have been for a year now, not only that but like I’ve stated in the comments we’ve all asked her too wear a mask when going into places with high risk cases. I’m not asking her too stop having fun or whatever but she wasn’t being careful at all Knowing where we live has been getting higher cases.

Update: I did talk too my mom and I told her I was still upset with her for not taking this serious and Atleast not trying too do something as simple as sanitize. She said she was sorry but there’s nothing she can do, so I’m just gonna stay in my room for now until I fully calm down. Moving on for those who are saying I should move out, I’m too young too move out. And I understand what I said earlier was most likely out of anger but like I said in comments she didn’t do anything too at least avoid from getting sick. (She doesn’t really believe she can get sick or something) and too everyone telling me it’s not a big deal too catch Covid, I have too disagree with you on that one, maybe it’s not a big deal too you but it is too me. And telling me too get over it isn’t gonna help lmao, if ur gonna comment that than just don’t comment at all. Anyways I’m still gonna be somewhat upset over it, maybe just not as much but still"

Our marriage has never been easy and the first 8 years (3 years dating and 5 married) she caught me messaging other girls (Nothing more than flirty texts / no nudes or anything)

But after she almost left me  I realized what I was doing was wrong and she deserved better before our daughter was born and I changed and became a devoted husband and father.

I then caught her sending nudes to some other man, this is when she changed too, she became nasty and vindictive and pretty much treated me like a stranger. She would come home late from work and whenever she got home disappear into the room on her phone.

Fast forward 4/5 years and I catch her again messaging a guy from her office and when I confronted her she told me she wants a divorce and admits to actually sleeping with guy #1, 4 years ago. I'm devastated and crushed for 3 months. I sit in self pity and wallowing, her not listening to any of my pleas.

I found solace in a friend, a girl and she was very sweet and supportive but also not allowing a “relationship” till my divorce was settled.  But my wife noticed I was happier and motivated and decided she now wanted another chance.

I told my wife I’ll give her till September to prove to me I can trust her again and I cut all communication with my friend (Which hurt her very badly and she feels like collateral).

Well folks we’re in August and I found out my wife went out of her way on our daughter's birthday so sleep with an office guy not once but twice in the span of a work day. She was calling him Love and baby in her messages and talking about moving in together.

After more questioning I find a string of guys spanning back the last 4/ 5 years to the first time I caught her.  That she has actually slept with and cannot or will not tell me how many times she's been unfaithful.

Now I am calling for the divorce and she is again begging for another chance   
AITA for not giving her a 4th chance to rip my heart out?

wnkedp_1696,wnkedp,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Me (23F) and my now husband (25M) got married last May. We had an elopement and after the honeymoon we had a picnic with all our families and friends to celebrate. I live in Utah and (I’m not sure if this is a thing in other states) but people usually announce their wedding publicly in social media and ask people to send their address for an invitation. It’s usually really open and even without an invitation, people can still go. I didn’t want that and neither did my husband so we announced our wedding without all the details (like date and place), but didn’t invite everyone to our celebration. 

The day of the celebration some people that weren’t invited assisted. Specifically 2 guys who used to be my friends when I first moved to Utah, but that cut me out of their lives over a year and a half ago, I was so confused and honestly very offended, too when they showed up, because they used to be my closest friends once but they didn’t think I was worth keeping in their lives. I tried so hard to not distance myself from them because they were supposed to be my best friends and at that time I didn’t know many people. 

When they stopped reaching out I decided to let them go if they wanted to, I was really lonely and sad, a couple months after was when I met my husband. Mind you that these guys weren’t part of my life for the whole time I dated my husband, never reached out to congratulate me on our engagement or when I announced our wedding. They just showed up with a group of mutual friends (the ones I did invite) saying they wanted to “surprise me” because it’s been so long since I saw them (these guys literally live in the same county as me, we haven’t seen each other because they didn’t want to). I was so mad, I told them “you and I aren’t friends, you can’t disappear out of someone’s life and come back whenever you want and call that a friendship. This isn’t a friends reunion, this is a private event and you weren’t invited. Please get out of here” I didn’t yell or made a scene, I kept my voice calm and told them that in private. 

I tried to be as polite and clear as I could so there weren’t any  misunderstandings, but some people that heard of what I did said I was rude and petty, and that they didn’t mean any harm by coming so I should’ve let them stay and have food. I’m so confused because if they weren’t invited, I think it’s rude on them to show up, but the only person that really defended me was my husband. So I need others’ opinions, was I the asshole?"

But here’s the thing my parents decided a while back that we didn’t need wifi anymore so they turned it off me and my siblings all have data on our electronics so no big deal.

Well my sister had ent gotten a job for almost they whole time done we graduated in 2021 just recently getting a job where she works 4 hours once a week. 

While I’ve had 2 jobs and work depending on my schedule maybe 6 days a week 8 hours each day .

Our parents took our old phones to show us we needed to get our own I’ve since bought mine and she has yet.

But she kept an old phone and I warned her she only going to get into trouble as she doesn’t think of the long term effects of something I warned her to not us or post on social media because our mom will find out and she did which also led her to find out that she was talking to our birth parents.

Whom are some of the worst people ever just gaslighting manipulative people I’ve cut them off more than a year ago after a visit with my birth giver went bad and she just blamed everyone else but herself and kept lying and I cut my Sperm donor off after he threatened my (adoptive)mom but that’s a whole different story. 

Anyway she got onto my little sisters iPad and has been using her hotspot which my parents found out about but they don’t know it’s her just that someone has been using it I found out she’s still talking to my birth parents even after all we heard and all the nasty things they have said.

I feel so bad for my parents and mad she’s literally not smart enough to us the hotspot at night like I said for a bit but no she will us it all day then she’ll complain and act happy that she has been using it and hasn’t been caught. 

I warned her if she continues I will tell my parents but honestly I’m thinking just waiting until she’s out of her room and stealing the phone as I know we’re it is but I also feel bad so would be the a hole for taking the phone ?"

My SO once call me when Im at my job Screaming because I couldn't picked up my phone, Calling me a ""Cheating piece of $h1t"" because I couldn't call back fast enough.

Its not like they can go to their parents due to their parents being emotionally and physically abusive when they were younger, they told me themselves they ""Rather Ki11 myself then see those abusive fucks"".

I want to help, I really do but im starting to resent our relationship and They wont go to therapy or take their medication and last time I tried to convince them to take it they cried that I was trying to hurt them so I backed off.

Edit: thank you for all your comments. I have contacted my brother about everything, So him and his fiance have been helping me leave.  I will update after the whole situation is done."
wp3xl7_1729,wp3xl7,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,I (32 female) recently bought my nephews (Jamie 18) girlfriend (Elle 18) a plane ticket to his graduation and my sister (39 female)  is losing her mind.  For backstory my sister has two children Jamie and my niece who is four years younger than him.  When my sister was in her late twenties she divorced their father because he was abusive and became a full time single mom.  So I moved in and helped her raise the kids.  This included taking and picking them up from school events as well as helping with homework and cooking and cleaning.  Since my sister had been with her husband for so long she saw this as an opportunity to live out her twenties meaning she dated a lot and went out a lot leaving me home with the kids and missing out on my twenties.  I didn’t mind at first but then I realized I wanted a family of my own.  So I started to want to go out and that did not go over well.  I had to plan around her nights out and at one point she said I had to find a babysitter for her kids since she already had plans. Then when it came to dating she always tore me down making me extremely self conscious.  Telling me things like “a guy won’t date you if your car is dirty.” Or “you smell today did you even shower?”  It got in my head as well as when I would show her guys I wanted to go out with she would make me question them and if they would be good.  Eventually I reached my breaking point and moved out. I missed the kids like crazy and they cried when I left but I stayed in touch. Fast forward to now and I’m with an amazing guy who I now live with.  My nephew has joined the army and I’m so proud of him.  My sister insisted that before he go to Boot Camp he get a job.  But no job would take him between when he graduated high school and the few months he had before going to boot camp.  So I got him a job at my work and he moved in with me so he wouldn’t have to commute to the store I could just take him with me.  His girlfriend Elle would come over all the time and when he left I promised I would keep in touch with her.  He gave her a promise ring before he left for bootcamp that I helped him get because his mother liked to say “don’t get used to her.” To our family. His mother is supportive of their relationship when they are around but otherwise doesn’t like it even though Elle is a sweetheart who works and goes to college. Well my nephews graduation from bootcamp is coming up and my sister is paying for herself and a couple others to go (her boyfriend and dad) My boyfriend and I are going as well.  It is in another state so it is pricey. When I recently talked to Elle she had mentioned wanting to go and that Jamie tells her in every letter.  (They write each other everyday) How much he wishes she could be there. So when she asked my sister if she could go my sister said that she was paying for too many people already and that maybe we could FaceTime her. Elle had no intention of having my sister pay for her.  But she didn’t want to push (my sister makes her nervous). So Elle let it go.  I asked Elle if she had the money for a plane ticket and she said she did.  So I bought her a plane ticket and told her to save her money for food and activities and that she could share a hotel room with my boyfriend and I.  I know my nephew would love to see her and we don’t know when we will get to see him again so this could be Elle’s last chance for the year. Elle was so grateful my sister on the other hand was furious.  She said that I disrespected her and that I had no right to do this without talking to her.  She told me that Elle is my responsibility and that I will have to help her with money as well as her health. (Elle is diabetic) I told her the trip was not about her it’s about showing our love and support for Jamie.  Elle deserves to be there too since they have been together for eight months and Jamie is very serious about her.  My sister said that my love for Jamie doesn’t excuse the fact that I disrespected her.  She said I wouldn’t understand because I have no children.  I lived with her for almost eight years moved in when Jamie was eight and his sister was four. And even before that spent my summers and weekends watching her kids. After school I would go to her house and switch off with their baby sitter until she or her husband came home.  I don’t think I was in the wrong since I was trying to make Jamie happy. But I’m not a mom so I’m wondering am I the A?

I use my laptop &amp; iPad with a Apple Pencil to take notes &amp; pretty much everything, and yes did pay for iPad with my own hard earned money. I don’t use paper because it is too much to carry &amp; most profs Prefer online as well. My brother 11M broke his iPad &amp; my family refused to buy him a new one or fix his old one.

They told me that they wanted my brother to use it because he stayed home alone when they ran errands, &amp; needed a way to contact them for emergencies.

They assured me that it would only be for the summer &amp; that it was still mine &amp; I would get it back once fall semester came around. Well fall semester is about a week away &amp; I told my family that I was gonna need it back in the next few days. But to my surprise my brother cracked my iPad screen. The iPad is still able to be used but of course has cracks on it that are noticeable. The cracks do mess up the way I write when  I am taking notes since, making some parts shaky and messy. I told them they had to pay for the damages &amp; they are blowing me off as if I am joking or will just settle with MY iPad being broken. After a few days I blew up on them saying they’re hypocrites because they’re always going on how they want me to finish school &amp; be successful, but have no problem giving away my supplies preventing me from being successful.

First I want to say thank you to everyone who supported me. For those saying I was the AH because they pay for college &amp; still live with them heres backstory: my family is not low/medium class, my family is very fortunate to have a good financial backing. Them having financial status has never made me feel entitled to anything. I was more than willing to get student loans but they told me not too because it would mess me up in the future. In addition I did try to move out when I was 18 &amp; my family gaslit me &amp; manipulated me to stay with them. If I wanted to move out I could because I do work in the ER as a nursing assistant making decent money to support myself.

wq2bhc_1757,wq2bhc,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"  For some context I guess, I (22) started going by a different name starting at the age of 14 (that was also the year I was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, and had came out as genderfluid and I still identify that way). I went by different names over a few years. I found the one that fit me when I was 16 and have gone by it ever since. Let's substitute that name with the letter R, and my birthname with the letter M (for privacy reasons). My mom was excepting when I came out as bisexual. And said she was when I came out as genderfluid, but she has always continued to misgender me and just keeps calling me my birthname no matter what. Ever since I started going by R, I kept telling my mom I was legally going to change it. She always told me that it was hurtful to her because she chose the name M for me and wanted a child with that name for years. Her best friend, as well as most of my family agree with her. I've tried to explain to her that M has become a trigger word for me over the years because of how it's been used towards me (verbal and mental abuse by my whole family, especially her). 
  
  And I'm not just assuming it's my trigger, I've been in therapy for over 12 years now and the past few years that's what my therapists have noticed, that I respond to it like a trigger word. I really have tried to explain it to her so many times and to my family. But no one really acknowledges the abuse, even physical. I've even been asked (in front of my mom) if my mom has ever hit me before, both her and I said ""yes"" at the same time. My mother always threatened me all my life, my clearest memory of something she said was when I was 12. I asked to talk to her about something at school and she got mad and threw her book at me. She then proceeded to yell at me for making her lose her spot, I was confused and started crying. She chased me into my room and told me she wanted to hit me. My response was I told her then I'd call the cops, and her exact words were ""Do it. I'll dial the number and hand you the phone. But the time they get here, you'll be an unrecognizable bloody pulp on the ground."" She had me slammed up against the wall and was in my face at that point. Her and my aunt told me not to tell anyone about it. A few hours later I texted my friend from school about it telling her what my mom said, turns out I sent the message to my mom by mistake.
 

  But anyway.. I'm getting off topic, I apologize. I am 22 now, engaged to a lovely lovely man (21), whom accepts my gender identity, sexuality, and loves my chosen name. We enrolled in a job training program last year and have been here for 5 months now. Everyone here always calls me R, because it's what I've introduced myself as for years now. And one of the promises my fiancé made to me was that we were going to get my name legally change while we're here. I've had the paperwork I need all filled out and signed for a while now and he said he's going to pay for it even though I told him I wanted to try and make the money myself. He knows how important it is to me, and I can tell it's actually important to me to. 
 
  When I first printed out the paperwork a few months ago I was planning on just changing it and not telling my family or mom, but they'd all find out because legally in still dependent on my mom and stuff (I have a few mental disabilities, so it's hard for me to do some things myself sometimes). But one day I was video chatting my mom, and I don't know what compelled me to do this, but I started talking about the papers and read some things on them to her and showed them to her. She started sobbing and saying how much it was hurting her. I started crying and trying to justify myself and trying to explain. She said she ""couldn't do this right now"" and hung up on me. I went to my friend who was in my dorm and she held me while I cried in the bathroom. 
 
  Last month my fiancé and I went on PTO and went home to see our families. He let me stay at his house the whole time with him and family. We visited my mom a few times while home. She wanted to spend the day with us, and she took us to her best friend's house. We were all fine and my fiancé was smoking a cig on the front porch while my mom, her friend, and I were all sitting in the living room. I started thing about when she hung up on me. I calmly but nervously got her attention and said ""Mom, I think you and I need to talk about something."" She said ""Alright, what?"" I told her it was what she hung up the phone on me about a while back. She said ""we are not talking about that"", I told her we needed to talk about it at some point and it better to me sooner than later. She then started sobbing and started talking again about how much it hurts her and how I'm just doing it to hurt her. I started crying as well and said that if I could do it without hurting anyone, I'd do that. She then started yelling at me about how I've always disrespected her for absolutely no reason and how she doesn't deserve it. I've never intentionally disrespected her, I've been terrified of her all my life so I've always tried to do what she said and do whatever to make her happy and not mad at me. Her best friend then jumps in the conversation and says ""M, you were by no means an abused child. If anything, you are abusive to your mom."" I went silent because I literally had no idea what to say. I don't remember what was said next but mom started yelling at me again. I ended up getting up and running out the front door when mom yelling after me saying ""don't you dare walk out that door. You *really* wanted to have a conversation didn't you?? Huh??"". 
 
  I sat on the front steps and cried for a minute. Then I went back inside and mom made me apologize to her friend for slamming her door. I apologized. I sat back down and my fiancé came in. He could hear us yelling from the porch. He joined in the conversation. He's very good at speaking, very formal. I don't remember what he said but I told my mom that she was my parent and I her child and asked ""isn't your job to your child to make sure I'm safe and *happy* in life? **This** will make me happy."" I was crying again. She said ""I'm allowed to have an opinion on it, I'm still your mother."" I told her and her friend that my birthname is literally a trigger word, like I've told them so many times. My mom looked at me and said ""I fucking hate the name 'R'. In elementary school a boy named R was mean to me."" Her friend said ""You say the name M is triggering to you. Well, the name R is triggering for your mom."" They them started saying that if I really want to change my name, then my mom should get to pick what it is because she gave birth to me. I told them no.     I don't remember the rest of the conversation, but we all calmed down somehow, and my mom drove my fiancé and I back to his house. (Another thing I explained to my mom and her friend was, I can't stand even hearing the name M. Even if it's not directed at me. Like if I hear it on TV, see it written down, on my ID, even my student badge here on campus. And when it *is* directed at me, like someone talking to me, I instantly tense up and get scared.) 
 
  Before I came on campus, literally no one in real life called me R. Only maybe two people, and my online friends. And since I've been here, literally every one calls me R (even my fiancé of course) every time they see me, even when talking about me when I'm not around. I love it so so much. But now that makes me hearing my birthname even worse. 

  **Idk how to end this.. but AITAH?**"
wq2bhc_1759,wq2bhc,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"  For some context I guess, I (22) started going by a different name starting at the age of 14 (that was also the year I was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, and had came out as genderfluid and I still identify that way). I went by different names over a few years. I found the one that fit me when I was 16 and have gone by it ever since. Let's substitute that name with the letter R, and my birthname with the letter M (for privacy reasons). My mom was excepting when I came out as bisexual. And said she was when I came out as genderfluid, but she has always continued to misgender me and just keeps calling me my birthname no matter what. Ever since I started going by R, I kept telling my mom I was legally going to change it. She always told me that it was hurtful to her because she chose the name M for me and wanted a child with that name for years. Her best friend, as well as most of my family agree with her. I've tried to explain to her that M has become a trigger word for me over the years because of how it's been used towards me (verbal and mental abuse by my whole family, especially her). 
  
  And I'm not just assuming it's my trigger, I've been in therapy for over 12 years now and the past few years that's what my therapists have noticed, that I respond to it like a trigger word. I really have tried to explain it to her so many times and to my family. But no one really acknowledges the abuse, even physical. I've even been asked (in front of my mom) if my mom has ever hit me before, both her and I said ""yes"" at the same time. My mother always threatened me all my life, my clearest memory of something she said was when I was 12. I asked to talk to her about something at school and she got mad and threw her book at me. She then proceeded to yell at me for making her lose her spot, I was confused and started crying. She chased me into my room and told me she wanted to hit me. My response was I told her then I'd call the cops, and her exact words were ""Do it. I'll dial the number and hand you the phone. But the time they get here, you'll be an unrecognizable bloody pulp on the ground."" She had me slammed up against the wall and was in my face at that point. Her and my aunt told me not to tell anyone about it. A few hours later I texted my friend from school about it telling her what my mom said, turns out I sent the message to my mom by mistake.
 

  But anyway.. I'm getting off topic, I apologize. I am 22 now, engaged to a lovely lovely man (21), whom accepts my gender identity, sexuality, and loves my chosen name. We enrolled in a job training program last year and have been here for 5 months now. Everyone here always calls me R, because it's what I've introduced myself as for years now. And one of the promises my fiancé made to me was that we were going to get my name legally change while we're here. I've had the paperwork I need all filled out and signed for a while now and he said he's going to pay for it even though I told him I wanted to try and make the money myself. He knows how important it is to me, and I can tell it's actually important to me to. 
 
  When I first printed out the paperwork a few months ago I was planning on just changing it and not telling my family or mom, but they'd all find out because legally in still dependent on my mom and stuff (I have a few mental disabilities, so it's hard for me to do some things myself sometimes). But one day I was video chatting my mom, and I don't know what compelled me to do this, but I started talking about the papers and read some things on them to her and showed them to her. She started sobbing and saying how much it was hurting her. I started crying and trying to justify myself and trying to explain. She said she ""couldn't do this right now"" and hung up on me. I went to my friend who was in my dorm and she held me while I cried in the bathroom. 
 
  Last month my fiancé and I went on PTO and went home to see our families. He let me stay at his house the whole time with him and family. We visited my mom a few times while home. She wanted to spend the day with us, and she took us to her best friend's house. We were all fine and my fiancé was smoking a cig on the front porch while my mom, her friend, and I were all sitting in the living room. I started thing about when she hung up on me. I calmly but nervously got her attention and said ""Mom, I think you and I need to talk about something."" She said ""Alright, what?"" I told her it was what she hung up the phone on me about a while back. She said ""we are not talking about that"", I told her we needed to talk about it at some point and it better to me sooner than later. She then started sobbing and started talking again about how much it hurts her and how I'm just doing it to hurt her. I started crying as well and said that if I could do it without hurting anyone, I'd do that. She then started yelling at me about how I've always disrespected her for absolutely no reason and how she doesn't deserve it. I've never intentionally disrespected her, I've been terrified of her all my life so I've always tried to do what she said and do whatever to make her happy and not mad at me. Her best friend then jumps in the conversation and says ""M, you were by no means an abused child. If anything, you are abusive to your mom."" I went silent because I literally had no idea what to say. I don't remember what was said next but mom started yelling at me again. I ended up getting up and running out the front door when mom yelling after me saying ""don't you dare walk out that door. You *really* wanted to have a conversation didn't you?? Huh??"". 
 
  I sat on the front steps and cried for a minute. Then I went back inside and mom made me apologize to her friend for slamming her door. I apologized. I sat back down and my fiancé came in. He could hear us yelling from the porch. He joined in the conversation. He's very good at speaking, very formal. I don't remember what he said but I told my mom that she was my parent and I her child and asked ""isn't your job to your child to make sure I'm safe and *happy* in life? **This** will make me happy."" I was crying again. She said ""I'm allowed to have an opinion on it, I'm still your mother."" I told her and her friend that my birthname is literally a trigger word, like I've told them so many times. My mom looked at me and said ""I fucking hate the name 'R'. In elementary school a boy named R was mean to me."" Her friend said ""You say the name M is triggering to you. Well, the name R is triggering for your mom."" They them started saying that if I really want to change my name, then my mom should get to pick what it is because she gave birth to me. I told them no.     I don't remember the rest of the conversation, but we all calmed down somehow, and my mom drove my fiancé and I back to his house. (Another thing I explained to my mom and her friend was, I can't stand even hearing the name M. Even if it's not directed at me. Like if I hear it on TV, see it written down, on my ID, even my student badge here on campus. And when it *is* directed at me, like someone talking to me, I instantly tense up and get scared.) 
 
  Before I came on campus, literally no one in real life called me R. Only maybe two people, and my online friends. And since I've been here, literally every one calls me R (even my fiancé of course) every time they see me, even when talking about me when I'm not around. I love it so so much. But now that makes me hearing my birthname even worse.

I have been talking to this girl for a few months now and the sex conversation finally came up. We were knee deep into the conversation when I asked her “how many bodies do you have?” She paused for a second but then said she has a little over 10. 


This really threw me in for a loop because I did not expect it to be that high. She told me she has a very high sex drive and it’s hard to contain herself so she has a lot of one night stands. I explained to her that there is nothing wrong with that but due her one night stands and the high body count that I refuse to have sex with her.

It's been a long almost seven years but I loved most of it. As of recently, I been using the words mine,my, and I because I feel like I have lost my individuality on the relationship and my baby father says to me why can't we use the terms ours, we and us? I'm honestly tired of doing everything together. We have been doing everything together since I moved in with him at 18. Our friends even loop us together and it can never be just him or just me. I miss my individuality and miss doing things by myself or just me time. When I bring this up, he gets irritated or shuts down and says I'm trying to start an argument. I personally feel that this won't work if I cannot be my own individual. The only me time I get is when I'm in the bathroom and maybe not even then because of the kids doesn't come in, he will. He will even ask how long I will be in the bathroom because I apparently take to long. (10-15 minutes). I consider the time I spend in the bathroom my me time because I RARELY ever get breaks from my kids. It's getting so annoying that if I want my individuality I have to go to the bathroom to do so.

wrr2ea_1804,wrr2ea,top-comment,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"My best friend Chloe is a very picky eater and it’s difficult to eat out together anywhere. She has sensory issues and struggles with the texture and taste of a lot of foods and so has a limited diet which she finds embarrassing. She’s reluctant to go out to restaurants for celebrations as she often eats off the children’s menu which draws attention to her. It was her 40th birthday a few weeks ago and she requested a low key celebration and as she doesn’t really like crowds or drink much alcohol it ruled out a lot of the usual birthday celebration ideas. I had the idea to do an afternoon tea party for her in my garden as it’s a large beautiful space and there was no pressure to eat off a menu as we could choose her favourite foods. I put bunting up in the garden and invited 10 of her closest friends and family, I organised games, mocktails, sangria and gin cocktails in teapots with tea cups instead of tea. 
For the afternoon tea we had plain cheese and egg mayo sandwiches on white bread instead of traditional cucumber or smoked salmon, salt and vinegar crisps, mini sausage rolls and quiches, chocolate eclairs and my friends mother baked a special birthday cake. 
On the day it was beautiful and sunny and we had lots of fun catching up and playing games, Chloe loved her surprise tea party. 
Everyone turned up but one of our friends also brought her 13 year old daughter “Becky” who was supposed to have been with her father for the day. Unfortunately he was unwell and as it wasn’t a rowdy party my friend said she had no choice but to bring Becky along. 
When we made the afternoon tea we made sure there was a lot of food to eat as some people were drinking which can cause them to be more hungry then usual and we thought it was better to do too much then too little. Unfortunately just having one extra person stretched it as Becky eats a lot! Everyone took a small plateful but Becky loaded her plate and then went back for another whilst everyone else was still nibbling their first. Chloe was so busy chatting with everyone that she was very slow at eating, by the time she went to get a sausage roll (her absolute favourite) they had gone. Becky had eaten 6! 
We brought the cake out and sang happy birthday and Chloe was moved to tears, she cut it up and managed to get it into 11 pieces and put it on the cake stand for everyone to take a piece. I was busy talking when a friend came over and discreetly mentioned Becky was on her third slice of cake. I was annoyed at this because it now meant some people weren’t going to get any, so I decided to ask her mum nicely if she could speak to her. Unfortunately I couldn’t see her mum anywhere so I thought I’d speak to Becky. One of the pieces of cake was untouched on her plate so I thought I’d ask her to put it back so someone else could try some. I approached her and said nicely that I was glad she was having a nice time but I explained there wasn’t enough cake for everyone now and asked her to put the slice back. I said I was worried Chloe wouldn’t get any like with the sausage rolls. She started to cry and said to her mum I’d called her a greedy pig when her mum came and saw us together, it made her mum very angry and she didn’t believe me when I denied that happened. After that they ended up leaving early which is a shame as up until then the day had been perfect and it made things a bit awkward. 
Since then a couple of people said I was in the wrong to approach Becky no matter how nicely but as she was at an adult party I tried to reason with her like one. AITA?"

Mia and one of her friends asked us if they could sleep in our apartment one night, my bf was ok with that but I have 3 easy rules they needed to follow (my bf thought my rules was good) 1.  Don’t eat our food without asking first 2. They need to sleep on the couch 3. Don’t sit in our bed
Due to my autism I have hard to feel comfortable around new people in this case Mias friend. My plan was to be out as long as I could before going home to sleep so I didn’t need to spend more time then necessary with them. (My bf was out of town  at the day and was coming home later in the evening). I went to one of my friend (22M) we talked and started drinking alot. My bf picked me up later and we went home. When we come home they had eaten a lot of our food and sat in our bed. A side note I have a thing that if you want to sit in my bed you need to take a shower first because otherwise I feel like I need to clean all the sheets and due to my depression I haven’t the the energy to clean it and change it (my bf works 10 hours at day so he has not the time to do it). So that gave me a emotional breakdown and my drunk as didn’t do the whole thing better. I started to talk and begged them to get of the bed and sleep on the couch.

I told her that I had have a tough day and just wanted them to just respect my rules. She started arguing that the apartment wasn’t even mine because my boyfriend paid the rent and then she started out of the blue to say that I need to be one her good side because all in my bf family hates me and how I lie about my depression and that ”I don’t look autistic”. Those words was really hurtful to hear. In the end my bf talked to his sister and 2 hours later they gave up and moved to the couch. The day after they had already left before I woke up. I felt like I need to clean the sheets and I needed to go to the market and buy groceries because they ate up almost everything we had, due to those things I was exhausted because that’s hard things to do for me due my depression. I talked to my bf that I don’t want his sister to be in our apartment again. Now his sister hates me and talk shit about me to theirs family and they shit talks my bf too because he took my side.Did I overreacted? AITA to forbid her to be in our apartment?"

Those words was really hurtful to hear. In the end my bf talked to his sister and 2 hours later they gave up and moved to the couch. The day after they had already left before I woke up. I felt like I need to clean the sheets and I needed to go to the market and buy groceries because they ate up almost everything we had, due to those things I was exhausted because that’s hard things to do for me due my depression. I talked to my bf that I don’t want his sister to be in our apartment again. Now his sister hates me and talk shit about me to theirs family and they shit talks my bf too because he took my side.Did I overreacted? AITA to forbid her to be in our apartment?"

I didn’t really find him attractive due to him being typical white (hunting gear, baggy jeans etc) and told him that. He got mad at me asking why I won’t give him the chance even though he’s been nothing but speak bad about black people and said how this the first time he found a black pretty and how I should fuck him because he knows I want to.

He’s also a Andrew tate fan 🫡 so it’s getting worse and worse and I just broke and told him that I don’t date white boys and he started to verbally attack my race and me and I gave him the same energy. I made him cry apparently and he’s currently telling people and they are messaging me. I personally don’t give a fuck because I said what the fuck I said, but the few white “friends” I have said I should of been less blunt about it. AITA"

So my brother Jayden (16m) was with his (now ex) girlfriend Ruby (15f) for 2 whole years. I thought they were happy together. Wrong. She doesn’t come by to the house like she used to well I was wondering why and Jayden said she was “busy”. 

Info: one red flag I saw was that when they would go out she would tell him “act like my friend and not my boyfriend”. I didn’t want to say anything because it’s not my place. 

Well me (23f) and my boyfriend Nick (25m) were baby shopping even though I’m 3 months so far. We went to eat at this Mexican restaurant (where Jayden met Ruby) we stopped on our tracks when we saw Ruby with this other guy. They were holding hands and doing couple things. Nick took a picture just in case. 

We called Jayden asked where he was and he told us he was at Target to get a birthday gift for Ruby ( her birthday is on the 1st of September).  I told him to pay what he has and to meet us outside. We met him outside of Target and we showed Jayden proof well he didn’t believe us till we took him where Ruby was. He was mad. He went and confronted her (he was bouncing his leg up and down ; he does this when he’s extremely mad) she ended up claimed that they were cousins…Jayden asked if cousins hold hands and do couple things. She denied it till Jayden showed her a photo. She started to cry and apologized.

He broke up with her and told her to stay out of his life. She kept begging for him to not leave her. I was shocked by this. Jayden told her no that she lost her chance and she will never get that back again. We left and went to eat somewhere else and because Jayden didn’t want to eat where he met her. After we ate we took Jayden to his friends house (girl) her name is Abby (16f). 

Jayden had a plan when we told him that Ruby was at our door step….he was gonna “fake date” Abby. Well Jayden showed up with Abby holding hands and told Ruby to leave. Ruby was shocked. 

Ruby started yelling at us…calling us AH for ruining her relationship. I laughed and told her that she ruined her relationship. Now Ruby’s older sister Mackenzie called me an AH for ruining her sisters relationship with my brother. I didn’t care and didn’t want to answer so I deleted the messages and blocked them off of everything. 

AITA? 

For clarification: Jayden moved on in 3 weeks (yes that’s how long it takes him) now he is dating Abby and he has been happy ever since then. Haven’t seen him this happy in a long time.

Edit: I forgot to mention this….Amber is my biological sister, Jayden is my half brother (from my mothers side), and I have a little half sister Lena (from my dads side)"

I was sitting in a bench, holding my child in my chest, with his head on my shoulder when a unknown lady comes from behind saying: “what a beautiful baby” and extending her hand out to touch his face/head. I almost saw everything in slow Motion. I told her to please not touch him. The lady was really offended and replied that she loves babies and no one ever told her no. I repeated that she cannot touch him, since I dont know her. She left fuming and saying I was crazy. My husband actually told me that Im being an AH for telling her no, instead of just obliging.

The problems started when me and Greg met Simone. Simone instantly started flirting with him. He didn’t flirt back he just laughed it off. She said it was a joke so I didn’t really care even if she was bisexual or something she’s in a relationship with my sister. But her behavior started to get progressively worst until last weekend when we all met up at me and Greg’s apartment. She was being extra flirty while me and my sister were making lunch. When we were about to bring lunch in, she climbed into my boyfriend’s lap and straddled him.

He was so obviously uncomfortable and he tried to push her off but she just laughed and said, “Chill I’m gay, remember?” That’s when I lost it. I told her to get off my boyfriend and to leave my apartment. She started acting confused and was like “I’m just joking can you calm down?” But I wouldn’t let up and said, “I don’t care what your stupid f*cking sexuality is leave my boyfriend alone.”My sister left with her and called me an insecure AH for blowing up at a gay girl for flirting with my boyfriend.

Greg is backing me up and said he did feel uncomfortable but my parents both said I shouldn’t see Simone as a threat since she is gay.

Because of COVID a bar right around the corner from her apartment has offered cocktails to go, so I usually pick them up and head to her house every Friday.

Yesterday, I was standing around and waiting for our drinks looking on my phone when a girl approached me and whispered “I need your help, please I’ll give you anything.” She sounded truly desperate so I looked up, confused. 

There was a creepy looking guy following her right towards me. I’m 6’5 and fairly muscular so I’m sure that’s why she chose me. I understood what she needed and put my arm around her as protectively as I could. Then the bartender handed me our drinks and I gave Kate’s to the girl so it wasn’t suspicious. When the guy saw me about two feet away he stopped short. I gave him my most intimidating look and asked if he needed something. He said no and walked off. I reordered Kate’s drink and walked the girl to her car. She thanked me profusely and gave me money for the drink, which I refused. I walked off as soon as I saw her safely drive out of the parking lot.

When I got to Kate’s apartment she asked what took so long and I told her the story. She was pissed. She said it was incredibly disrespectful of me to act like I had a different girlfriend and to give her my real girlfriend’s drink. I was taken aback because I thought she’d be happy I helped that girl out of that situation. 

Our fight escalated and she kept saying how I basically cheated until I lost it and said, “I’d take you being uncomfortable over a girl getting raped or murdered any fucking day of the week and if you disagree you’re selfish and an awful person.” She kicked me out of her apartment and we still haven’t talked. Most of my friends think I was in the right but one of my female friends thinks that I shouldn’t have given her the drink so it was kind of disrespectful. That made me unsure so AITAH?

Edit: I just thought of this but I only described the pretending to be her boyfriend thing to her because that’s what I was thinking of when I did it. But looking back my actions could’ve been a brothers or even a friends so maybe I’m the AH for pretending to be her bf rather than a brother or a friend which both would’ve worked?

wtzhj3_1872,wtzhj3,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I'm a 17m and i'm having trouble with my mom. Physically she supports me by putting food on the table, clothes on my, back, shelter, and entertainment. But she was never really there for me emotionally. The reason why I say this is because I observed how she would be in everyone's business and gossip about it. Another thing Is that i'm struggling with homeschooling and she hasn't lifted a finger to help me, but would always complain that i'm not done my work. I've been home schooled for about 5-6 years, and I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, stress, 3 mental breakdowns, and burnout. Throughout all of this she still calls me lazy. I tried to talk to her about it, but she turned it around and called me lazy again. But i'm suppose to respect her when she doesn't take my emotions seriously. Also, she called me psychotic, delusional, and narcissistic because I proved her wrong twice. She says i'm manipulative, but she manipulated me into hating her brother and my bio dad. She called my bio dad a deadbeat because he abandoned me and sell me off to someone, but I recently got into contact with him and he told me that he didn't abandon me. It turns out my Adoptive mom didn't trust him or my bio mom to take care of me because they were struggling financially, so she filed out a police report for kidnapping because my dad tried to take me back from her twice. They had his rights taken away so he couldn't take care of me. The thing is i'm getting different pieces of what actually happened. My dad said he wanted to take care of me but my adoptive my didn't trust him, my adoptive mom said he was a deadbeat who didn't want me and that she had to take care of me, and my cousin said that my adoptive mom wanted to take care of me. My adoptive mom never really taught us life skills, because she always expected us to know what to do, and if we didn't she would yell at me and my sisters and call us names.

Lastly, when I was little I would always tell her that I love her but her response every time was ''it takes a fool to learn that love don't love nobody.'' She said that every time, so I stopped saying it and she never says I love you to me now unless I say it, and every time I tried to give her a hug she would tell me to get off of her. To be honest idk what to do, AITA?"
wtzhj3_1874,wtzhj3,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I'm a 17m and i'm having trouble with my mom. Physically she supports me by putting food on the table, clothes on my, back, shelter, and entertainment. But she was never really there for me emotionally. The reason why I say this is because I observed how she would be in everyone's business and gossip about it. Another thing Is that i'm struggling with homeschooling and she hasn't lifted a finger to help me, but would always complain that i'm not done my work. I've been home schooled for about 5-6 years, and I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, stress, 3 mental breakdowns, and burnout. Throughout all of this she still calls me lazy. I tried to talk to her about it, but she turned it around and called me lazy again. But i'm suppose to respect her when she doesn't take my emotions seriously. Also, she called me psychotic, delusional, and narcissistic because I proved her wrong twice. She says i'm manipulative, but she manipulated me into hating her brother and my bio dad. She called my bio dad a deadbeat because he abandoned me and sell me off to someone, but I recently got into contact with him and he told me that he didn't abandon me. It turns out my Adoptive mom didn't trust him or my bio mom to take care of me because they were struggling financially, so she filed out a police report for kidnapping because my dad tried to take me back from her twice. They had his rights taken away so he couldn't take care of me. The thing is i'm getting different pieces of what actually happened. My dad said he wanted to take care of me but my adoptive my didn't trust him, my adoptive mom said he was a deadbeat who didn't want me and that she had to take care of me, and my cousin said that my adoptive mom wanted to take care of me. My adoptive mom never really taught us life skills, because she always expected us to know what to do, and if we didn't she would yell at me and my sisters and call us names.

She is also an employee of the local court system where we live so if her employer finds out how they discipline the kids it could cost her job among other things. 

I'm just frustrated because when I ask her for help with the kids and how to handle them she just tells me to deal with it and to set boundaries but when I do she tells me I can't do it in the way that I did it.

Now onto the problem,   1 week ago my bf wanted to try the cheerleader and coach costume and we did it when my friend wasn't in the house. I'm guessing she came back and heard us because the next day she sat us down and asked we be more quiet when doing it. I told her that we would try to be more quiet as to not be rude. Well yesterday night me and my bf wanted to do it again and we decided to because she would be getting a hotel that night. In the middle of us doing the devil's tango my friend burst in and told us we were inconsiderate to her feelings and that she can't stand us anymore. I told her it was my apartment and I'll do whatever I please. Now she's calling me a jerk and my bf said I was a bit to harsh so was i?









UPDATE: The update nobody asked for but here goes. My friend has moved out and cut contact with our whole friend group after a long paragraph. Here's the jist of it: 
"" After being kicked out from OP's and her boyfriend's apartment I have decided to cut all content with them. They have hurt me and kicked me out while I was pregnant. I'm staying at my mother's house and wish for you all to cut contact with OP immediately and if not I will cut off contact with you I have never experienced so much disrespect ever in my 19 years of living I can't take it anymore so we'll be cutting off contact."" 

First: I never knew she was even pregnant so that threw me off 

Second: I feel as though every time I try to help her she takes advantage of me. I do not like that.

This year we went with a big group of friends including her boyfriend  who I have met many times and am friends with. Just a little background info her and her boyfriend have an open relationship and I am single.  We ended up at a karaoke bar took a few shots and were vibing. Eventually her boyfriend ask if he could  kiss me, and before I answered I ask my friend if it was OK and she said yes. I didn't want to kiss him cause I was attracted to him, we were just vibing and a little tipsy having fun during pride, tbh I would have kissed almost anyone at that point. So we kissed a little, and then went back to doing karaoke.  My friend was getting a little drunk and pulled me aside asking a whole bunch of weird questions like did I want to fuck her boyfriend. At the time I didn't understand what she meant, I thought she meant did I want to have a threesome with them which I said I didn't mind because why not have some fun. Also I didn't find the threesome question weird cause we all almost had an orgy with my other friend and her boyfriend during New years, but stopped because someone wasn't into it anymore. So the karaoke bar was not the first time me and her boyfriend  kissed. Anyway after she asked me these questions my friend started talking about how I was her longest friend how much she loved me(as a friend). When we got back to the hotel all of a sudden she was upset, and I thought it had to do with the fact that she wanted to break up with her boyfriend which she said she wanted to do before we even went to NY. Eventually she broke up with her boyfriend and left the hotel without saying anything to me which I thought was weird. She told her boyfriend that he shouldn't have kissed me, and the I alway go after her boyfriend's which is why she didn't like that he kissed me. I have literally never dated anyone because i have anxiety and trauma when it comes to men, and i find it hard to find women I want to date so I was confused by what she meant. She has still not even told me she was upset with me she just unfollowed me on socials...I only knew she was mad cause her bf told me. Anyway it gas been 2 months and I have tried to contact her so we can talk but she just ignores me. She has also been telling our mutual friends that I always go after her boyfriends and that why she is mad, but they also know that I don't date so I'm confused as to why she keeps saying this. So...aitah for kissing my best friends boyfriend?"

I got to the point where I said I didn’t want anything to do with her or my step-dad anymore and that I would be coming over to get my clothes and the key to my apartment and that I’ll be going no contact after I get my key back. My mom is currently a co signer on my lease, but it ends in a month from now and my renewal lease has only my name on it. So in order to cut her off completely and go no contact I wanted the key back. I went over to their house after texting her and telling her I was coming and walked in through the front door because it was unlocked. I got my clothes from the back bedroom and then turned around and told my mom I wanted the key back. I want to preface this by saying my mom and I’s relationship has been rocky since childhood. She has always held everything she possibly can over my head, the main thing being money. So, she got remarried to Craig (step dad) and moved in with him, sold my childhood home and I moved into my apartment alone right after I turned 20. So we start bickering because my mom is asking me to leave but I say I won’t without the key. She starts making up these excuses about how she wants to make sure the apartment isn’t damaged and once there is a zero balance then she will give me the key back. I have always paid my rent on time so her acting as if there possibly could be a missed payment baffles me. My apartment complex is letting me renew my lease without her for a reason.. so How I took it was that she was just trying to keep the key to have something to hold over my head or to control me since that key is the only think standing in the way of me going no contact. So I refuse to leave without my key. Me and my mom are arguing in the hallways and at first Craig said just give her the key but my mom was adamant on wanting to “make sure there’s no damages” and that if she needs to get into my apartment then she has a way to. So my step dad says you are living in your own world not everything revolves around you your being a self centered bitch. I responded and said what a step dad you are and that’s when he came at me grabbed me by the back of the neck and arm and shoved into the glass door and out of the house and slammed the door shut.

The house will be in my name only and I am the only one who is paying anything towards it. My boyfriend is not currently working so all the bills are going to be on me.

My sister 19f called me a couple days ago and told me she needs somewhere to live as my dad kicked her out and asked if I would let her rent my shed once we move in for a few months. I told her she could as long as she pays rent for the time she is there without thinking of asking my boyfriend first when I got home and let him know what happened he freaked out and said I ruined everything by letting her stay there. 

He is now refusing to move into the new house because my sister will be there and saying I’m Abusive for making this decision without asking him first. I just didn’t think he would mind because we currently share an apartment with his sister and mom which was his decision he made without me.

Aita for letting my sister rent my shed without asking my boyfriend for permission first?

ww7fn9_1927,ww7fn9,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Yes, you read the title correctly— this is a long one so I’m sorry in advance. My husband and I live with his parents at the moment because his mom is very sick with brain cancer and his dad needs our help. They have three cats and a dog in addition to a whole house they literally cannot care for. My husband and I are the only reason they won’t be featured on an episode of hoarders in the near future. I don’t mind this situation because my husband and I have always agreed that when they needed us that we would take care of his parents (and my mom) and this gives us a chance to save money. However his mom is now at the point where she can’t hold her own body upright to ride the stair lift, to where my husband has to lift her entire body weight (168 lbs) and put her on the toilet every time she needs. I have a bit of an issue with this because even though my husband is a young man still, this is starting to take a toll on him physically and his back is constantly hurting him. It’s his mom though, and he literally won’t argue about it. My husband works evenings remotely and I am gone at work from 11AM-8PM. My FIL only hires outside help from 9AM-5PM and expects us to help at night and earlier in the morning as needed— which once again is not a huge deal but can be tricky. My husband and I have very little time for ourselves. 

In recent weeks things have really escalated though and my FIL has replaced our living room couch with a hospital bed so that my MIL can nap in the afternoon. This isn’t really a problem however the kitchen and living room are connected so if she’s napping I’m not allowed to cook because the noise, lights being on, and smell will bother her so I have to time my activities right or just go eat out. I suggested maybe we put the hospital bed in the formal living room that’s in a quieter part of the house but he waved me off and said that room was needed if they entertained (they don’t)— and she needs a 75” TV to watch at all times apparently even when napping. 

Now the biggest issue I have with this new setup is that now my FIL has been setting up the bedside commode in the living room and having my husband put her on it to POOP in the middle of the living room, which again, is an open floor plan that connects to the kitchen. I tried to explain this was not safe or ideal and surely we could set up the portable toilet in a room that was not open to the kitchen— but my FIL was incredibly irate with me and claimed that I was trying to shame his wife for needing to poop. It doesn’t help that she’s fully incontinent at this point— so he will insist on her sitting there for over an hour sometimes because “she is still going” without realizing she doesn’t control it anymore. 

So tonight I purposely went out earlier and picked up Thai food to try and eat before I had to help get her ready for bed, but when I got home she was on her toilet in the middle of the living room/kitchen and the whole house smelt foul. My husband said she had already been there for 30 mins and his dad insisted that she stay until she “finished”. After over an hour he finally got her cleaned up and at this point I was eating dinner in our room because the smell/unsanitary conditions— and I told them I couldn’t help get her in bed right at the moment because I was eating. I then hear my FIL screaming at my husband and saying “that bitch” several times because I was just supposed to sit in the kitchen and eat my food with that smell/bacteria in the air and my eating didn’t time well with her wanting to go to bed. 

My husband asked if we could perhaps help her go to the bathroom in the formal living room and consider opening windows/doors (with curtains closed of course) to hopefully reduce the smell and keep it from the kitchen. His dad accused him of being inconsiderate, screaming that his mom was sick and it was our job to help her even if it was inconvenient to us— and highly unsanitary. We clean their house every single day, do their dishes, upkeep their lawn and garden, do their laundry, care for all eight of the pets we have between us, and of course care for his mom (who really does need a skilled facility at this point)— but I can’t budge on this and I’m at the breaking point. Am I the asshole for thinking it’s gross and wrong to have her going to the bathroom in the living room/kitchen— is it an asshole move to suggest that it’s in another more private area with windows open for ventilation?"

I don’t mind this situation because my husband and I have always agreed that when they needed us that we would take care of his parents (and my mom) and this gives us a chance to save money. However his mom is now at the point where she can’t hold her own body upright to ride the stair lift, to where my husband has to lift her entire body weight (168 lbs) and put her on the toilet every time she needs. I have a bit of an issue with this because even though my husband is a young man still, this is starting to take a toll on him physically and his back is constantly hurting him. It’s his mom though, and he literally won’t argue about it. My husband works evenings remotely and I am gone at work from 11AM-8PM. My FIL only hires outside help from 9AM-5PM and expects us to help at night and earlier in the morning as needed— which once again is not a huge deal but can be tricky. My husband and I have very little time for ourselves. 

In recent weeks things have really escalated though and my FIL has replaced our living room couch with a hospital bed so that my MIL can nap in the afternoon. This isn’t really a problem however the kitchen and living room are connected so if she’s napping I’m not allowed to cook because the noise, lights being on, and smell will bother her so I have to time my activities right or just go eat out. I suggested maybe we put the hospital bed in the formal living room that’s in a quieter part of the house but he waved me off and said that room was needed if they entertained (they don’t)— and she needs a 75” TV to watch at all times apparently even when napping. 

Now the biggest issue I have with this new setup is that now my FIL has been setting up the bedside commode in the living room and having my husband put her on it to POOP in the middle of the living room, which again, is an open floor plan that connects to the kitchen. I tried to explain this was not safe or ideal and surely we could set up the portable toilet in a room that was not open to the kitchen— but my FIL was incredibly irate with me and claimed that I was trying to shame his wife for needing to poop. It doesn’t help that she’s fully incontinent at this point— so he will insist on her sitting there for over an hour sometimes because “she is still going” without realizing she doesn’t control it anymore. 

So tonight I purposely went out earlier and picked up Thai food to try and eat before I had to help get her ready for bed, but when I got home she was on her toilet in the middle of the living room/kitchen and the whole house smelt foul. My husband said she had already been there for 30 mins and his dad insisted that she stay until she “finished”. After over an hour he finally got her cleaned up and at this point I was eating dinner in our room because the smell/unsanitary conditions— and I told them I couldn’t help get her in bed right at the moment because I was eating. I then hear my FIL screaming at my husband and saying “that bitch” several times because I was just supposed to sit in the kitchen and eat my food with that smell/bacteria in the air and my eating didn’t time well with her wanting to go to bed. 

My husband asked if we could perhaps help her go to the bathroom in the formal living room and consider opening windows/doors (with curtains closed of course) to hopefully reduce the smell and keep it from the kitchen. His dad accused him of being inconsiderate, screaming that his mom was sick and it was our job to help her even if it was inconvenient to us— and highly unsanitary. We clean their house every single day, do their dishes, upkeep their lawn and garden, do their laundry, care for all eight of the pets we have between us, and of course care for his mom (who really does need a skilled facility at this point)— but I can’t budge on this and I’m at the breaking point. Am I the asshole for thinking it’s gross and wrong to have her going to the bathroom in the living room/kitchen— is it an asshole move to suggest that it’s in another more private area with windows open for ventilation?"

I tried changing the subject but she kept going back to us being best friends. After about 30 minutes I snapped and told her in front of them that she wasn’t my best friend. That I had three best friends and she wasn’t one of them. She then asked who they were. I replied our cousin who I grew up with and my friend from school who I knew since middle school were my best friends my age. But that my ultimate best friend was our mother. She started ranting about how SHE was my sister and not my cousin or my friend. I then told her how was that technicality MY fault? She started crying. I think that last comment might make me the asshole. For some more info my three best friends were always there for me and never gave up. No mater how much we struggled with my disabilities she was my rock. I’m adhd and have asbergers. I’m allergic to the meds so I have no help besides those three. My sisters wanted nothing to do with me growing up. They acted like I was some diseased alien. It wasn’t until I got a job and made money that they wanted to hang out and include me.

wxyilr_1980,wxyilr,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Ok so, today is my mom’s birthday. My older sister and I have been at work all day. When we got home, nobody was home.

Which would’ve been great, until we were told why everyone wasn’t home.

My step-dad of 5 years had made my mom drive around my siblings (to sports and etc). My stepdad decided to stay in his office. He runs a small business that makes shirts and spends all his time at his office.

My step-dad, since getting this business, has been crabby and completely uninterested in the family. He even goes as far as to yell and scream when I’m scheduled for work. I work 2 days a week from winter to mid spring. He’s upset because I’m not at home to babysit my youngest brother (who will be 3 this year). He says he doesn’t know what my mom wants him to do because “he’s not a paid babysitter”. I don’t get money from watching my little brother, I also don’t get any breaks from it.

Today (mom’s birthday), he drops all three kids on her and leaves to his office despite the rest of us telling him to take her to breakfast or something.

My younger sister had to remind him to pick up a cake from a grocery store and to get her a present yesterday.

He got her a cake that she hates and a 20$ Disney gift card (we go to Disney in September), along with some already wilting flowers.

He was very proud of himself, even after I asked how to flowers were wilting. His response was “well they stayed in a hot car for an hour while I worked on my shirts.”

As he took mom out to eat (cheap Mexican restaurant since he forgot to make a reservation), my siblings and I went to a store nearby for dinner.

While there, my sister saw that they had a white chocolate lemon cake, my mom’s favorite, it wasn’t a big cake either. It was just a small square of cake. We decided to get it for her since we knew she disliked the one my step dad got.

When they got back home, it was time to give out gifts.

My stepdad started by handing her the flowers and card followed by the reveal of the cake.

Then it was the kid’s turn. My elder sister gave her the small cake.

My stepdad started grumbling about how we might as well throw his whole cake away because we wanted to make her birthday a competition. Then I gave her my gift.

An important thing about my mom, she’s been to Disney quiet a bit. But she’s never gotten Mickey ears, they didn’t have any she was ever interested in.

So, in early July I custom ordered her a pair of Eeyore ears (her favorite character) so we could all wear ears at Disney (with shipping costed around 70$).

My stepdad was livid and started yelling at my sister and I for making him look like a joke on his wife’s birthday. He said there was no reason for him to even be there when he could be working on his business because we were just trying to make fun of him and show him up.

He berated me saying that I shouldn’t have spent that much money on ears because she can get official Disney ears on the trip and doesn’t need such a waste of money. He said that I was just trying to show off money I don’t have because I’m only 19 and still living with them.

It was a mess.

My step-grandparents say that I shouldn’t have spent so much. I should’ve told my step dad the plan to get her ears and split the cost for them. They say that I should tell her the ears were from the whole family to make it up to my stepdad and so my mom can have a gift from the whole family. They offered to give me a third of the price of the ears to say it.

But I don’t want to. I spent a week bouncing between gifts. My siblings think I shouldn’t either because it was a gift from me.

wyjm92_2000,wyjm92,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"I (M19) am decidedly Republican. Based on my views on countless policies, and a few political compass tests, I've figured Republicanism was more aligned to me. Of course when it comes to more social matters such as women's rights and civil rights, I'm all for that. But overall, I seem to view things a bit differently compared to my peers.

During the beginning of COVID when everything was tense, I had two female friends (Janice and Karina) who were very vocal about their views. Janice (F20) is a Democrat, and Karina (F19) is a Moderate, but more left and progressive with her beliefs. I never posted about my opinions in fear of backlash, but since they were close friends, I would often talk to them about political matters.  
I watched Prager U videos, mostly for comedy, but because to me, sometimes they'd bring up important points. I would ask Janice her opinion, and she would tell me there are better sources, which I would then read. But behind my back, she would tell Karina that she was concerned about me being republican and conservative, as though it were a bad thing. She never told me directly that she had an issue.

I've always been closer with Karina, so when she told me about Janice, I asked her if I was in the wrong. Karina told me that as long as I was open to learning and understanding the reasoning behind stuff, she doesn't care if I'm republican. BUT when it came down to serious matters involving the lives of others, she expected my undoubted support. I agreed, I don't think politics should have a say on what goes on in people's lives, but unfortunately that's not the case today. Regardless, I was more than willing to support those movements.

After the election, Karina found out that I didn't vote for Biden. She was not old enough to vote at the time (missed her chance to vote by a week), so she relied on others to vote for Biden for her, and ""do the right thing."" I didn't feel my beliefs aligned with Biden's agenda, so I didn't vote for him, and I didn't tell anyone, again fear of backlash. But Karina was pissed when she found out. We didn't talk for a while, she told me I was a sheep, but eventually she forgave me after I realized and admitted my decision was stupid (Capitol revolt). However, Janice began ignoring me completely. She and I hadn't spoken in a while and when I checked in, she sent me a post saying that it was okay to end friendships over political differences. Basically saying it's my fault. I asked Karina if she told Janice about my vote, and she swore she didn't. She even thinks Janice went a bit overboard. I asked another friend (M19) what he thought, and he said it's a bit hypocritical that Janice preaches about understanding others' views, yet refused to give me a chance."
wyjm92_2002,wyjm92,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,"I (M19) am decidedly Republican. Based on my views on countless policies, and a few political compass tests, I've figured Republicanism was more aligned to me. Of course when it comes to more social matters such as women's rights and civil rights, I'm all for that. But overall, I seem to view things a bit differently compared to my peers.

During the beginning of COVID when everything was tense, I had two female friends (Janice and Karina) who were very vocal about their views. Janice (F20) is a Democrat, and Karina (F19) is a Moderate, but more left and progressive with her beliefs. I never posted about my opinions in fear of backlash, but since they were close friends, I would often talk to them about political matters.  
I watched Prager U videos, mostly for comedy, but because to me, sometimes they'd bring up important points. I would ask Janice her opinion, and she would tell me there are better sources, which I would then read. But behind my back, she would tell Karina that she was concerned about me being republican and conservative, as though it were a bad thing. She never told me directly that she had an issue.

I've always been closer with Karina, so when she told me about Janice, I asked her if I was in the wrong. Karina told me that as long as I was open to learning and understanding the reasoning behind stuff, she doesn't care if I'm republican. BUT when it came down to serious matters involving the lives of others, she expected my undoubted support. I agreed, I don't think politics should have a say on what goes on in people's lives, but unfortunately that's not the case today. Regardless, I was more than willing to support those movements.

wyq96r_2007,wyq96r,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (22F) have been close friends with a guy (22M) for over 3 years. He’s always been my confidant and go to person, but it’s always just been a friendship. 

Almost 2 years into the friendship when I had gotten out of a relationship he told me he liked me. I politely responded that I don’t see him like that and that I would like to remain friends. He told me he didn’t want to damage the friendship so he was fine with that. I thought he had moved on. 

For the past 2 years since I had been in a serious relationship. He had picked out a ring, you get the idea. The relationship ended and a week after that he tells me again that he liked me and that i’m the perfect woman for him. I told him again that I saw him as a brother and didn’t want to date him, frustrated that he hadn’t moved on after i thought he did. We were still very close friends throughout my relationship, and he was even close with my now ex. I trusted him, confided in him, etc. 

When I politely rejected him for the second time, he cried and asked that I comfort him. I had to literally hold him and rub his back while he was upset over the rejection, and for the next hour he asked me why i didn’t find him attractive (was it his weight, his beard, etc), and i had to keep telling him it wasn’t any of that, it’s just that I saw him as a brother. That was one of the most uncomfortable experiences for me. He also talked about how his love language is physical touch, and if I could rub his back or hold him in the future if he needed comfort. This made me extremely uncomfortable, as the most I do with my guy friends is hug them.  

After all of this I just wasn’t comfortable being around him. I feel that our trust has been broken, and the touch thing especially made me uncomfortable. he clearly has some confidence issues, but i’m not his therapist. I feel that I shouldn’t sacrifice my boundaries that he had respected previously just to help him feel better. so, AITAH for ending this friendship?

EDIT:
after he first told me he liked me, we didn’t see each other for a few months so we could both process things and so he had time to figure out if we still wanted to be friends or not. we both chose to stay friends, as he had expressed several times that he had moved on and understood where i was coming from.

wz1ng1_2014,wz1ng1,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,I live in an apartment complex which is not the nicest neighborhood. I live on the 3rd floor and my apartment has a balcony. I was outside smoking yesterday and I can see an apartment on the first floor across from me. A young woman lives there with her boyfriend and 3 young kids. (All under 4)  the girl is always cheating on the boyfriend so they constantly fight. Yesterday was a particularly bad fight they had been going for two hours hitting slamming and cursing. I usually ignore it when they are grown and she keeps coming back. Not my business. Well I guess since it wasn't really affecting her man yesterday she decided to up stakes. She begins to throw the kids out the door and smack them around. He keeps trying to stop and keep her away from the kids but then she went after his new puppy he got two days ago. She starts punching the puppy and kicking the puppy. I broke my heart to see her beating on the kids and puppy so I called 911. My dad spazzed on me calling me snitch. He said I'm going to get us all killed and make all the neighbors hate me... My question is AITAH for calling 911 or should I just ignore it... I try my best but seeing her beat on those babies was where I drew my line. My dad said he doesn't care even if I see someone being killed don't call because we live in the ghetto. So AITAH?

wz5kuo_2026,wz5kuo,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Okay, so reading the title you’re probably like “yes, no question” but hear me out. 

Over the course of her (F62) relationship with her son (my partner, M27)his mother has done many things I (F26) consider to be unforgivable and neglectful but won’t get into here. This is literally just for context. He says it’s not my business to forgive her for anything she did to him and he’s right, but I still don’t. He however, does. Generally we all have had a good relationship, we haven’t ever fallen out, I have lived with her and she with me and my partner and our children (F2, F5mo and F5mo). 

For context, 5 months ago I was unexpectedly admitted to hospital for an emergency C section to have our twins. I ended up stuck in hospital for 2 weeks while our daughters learned how to live, and it was horrendously stressful and horrible for my partner, myself, and our daughter. I couldn’t see our 2 year old while I was in hospital due to covid rules so I had very little contact with her or my partner. His mother moved in while he continued to work in order to babysit our little girl, which was great. I eventually came home, we lived in harmony, everything was good. Or so we thought.

In July, 3 months after the twins were born, I arranged a short trip to celebrate my birthday and my daughters birthday at the same time. In short I arranged too much and it was a lot more stressful than it should have been, and my partner and I argued mildly a few times over the course of the holiday. After we came home, PM (partners mother) left to spend some time at her house, and we were left alone with the kids. It wasn’t the first time we’d had them all but between unpacking everything and them being unsettled, myself and BF (partner) ended up having a bad argument. In the end we both contacted PM to come and collect him so we could cool off. She gave her usual half assed response and said she wouldn’t come, so we worked it out ourselves. PM came back a total of 3 days after this argument and everything was (of course) fine. We continued to live together a full month, during which we discussed the argument (myself, BF and PM) and expressed that myself and BF would be commencing couples therapy to help us learn to deal with conflict better. 

On the last day of the month, before PM again went home, she called us into our own bedroom first thing in the morning to tell us that she had called the police and social services on her son, then left. We were both gobsmacked and didn’t really respond, BF had to leave to go to work, and I had to take care of the kids. The following day (Monday) I made a call to the social services team in our area to find out what allegations were made and what the course of action would be. They found no record of any complaint against us, so confused, I asked PM what she had said. She refused to elaborate further, and eventually we received a follow up call from CS to let us know that the complaint had been made to the NSPCC via the police, an allegation of emotional and physical abuse against our toddler. I was horrified, and assured them they could happily do spot checks, whatever was needed to quell the false accusation. They expressed confusion when I stated who had made the call, as it was apparently submitted anonymously, which they found very odd.

For further context while living with us PM engaged in strange behaviours like publicly digging through our bins, feeding our daughter questionable food, allowing daughter to refer to PM as mummy, various things like that. It was more work for me to watch her watching our child than it would’ve been to watch all three myself. While watching our daughter more than once PM fell asleep, left the house with the door wide open, allowed her to play with unsuitable things (once I caught daughter eating sun cream while PM was reading a book a few feet away in direct sight, also several times loaded a toothbrush with paste and allowed daughter to eat the paste before reloading the brush). PM is also increasingly belligerent towards BF, regularly tells him and me that he’s useless or a bad father etc. I stand up for him where I can but she isn’t my mother and often calls me disrespectful if I try. She also regularly attended Mother and Baby groups with daughter. We had several conversations with her about our expectations and boundaries which she ignored and I was beginning to strongly imply to both her and BF that it was time for her to leave. 

Anyway, we went through the telephone checks with CS, it was also referred to the health visitor who visited once a week for 4 months to ask if she had any concerns (she didn’t) and the police visited unexpectedly to perform a welfare check on the children. Everybody was fully satisfied that there was no foul play, and the case was moved to no further action. All of the involved authorities were quick to state, unprovoked, that we were doing great and how happy and healthy the kids were. As far as I am aware accusations of child abuse stay on your DBS for a period of more than 7 years. Almost all my work experience is in care or child care, which puts paid to me getting a job in those fields when the twins are old enough for me to return to work.

BF is already starting to ask if PM can come back after a month and continue to have a relationship with our children. I am refusing, not only because of her behaviour towards him, the ignorance of our boundaries while living under our roof, but also because I don’t believe the children are safe with her. AITA?"

wzaatz_2033,wzaatz,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So, I (27 F) have been talking to a guy (27 M) for 2+ years. I live in the U.K. and he lives in America. 

We met online a couple of years ago and over the course of two years we’ve called/FaceTimed/messaged. 

Things have happened over the 2 years such as him being dishonest about speaking to others and being intimate with other girls. I found out about one girl which ultimately lead to us ending. Then we were on and off throughout the 2 years. 

One day while we were talking on the phone (we were off at this time) he told me he was flying to the U.K. to see me. At first, I was excited to him as it had been so long that we’d had a relationship over the phone I was happy to see him. However, we argued on the days leading up to the visit and I told him not to come as he said he never wanted to speak to me again. I thought that was the end of it all until… he showed up the next day. 

I was shocked that he’d come but agreed to meet up as he’d spent so much money coming over here. When we hung out on was ok. He was quiet and we didn’t speak much because of the tension from the argument. 

The day after he said he’d met some people who offered to go take him out drinking. I went to work (I can choose my hours at the moment as it’s summer), told him to have a good time and didn’t think anything of it. He then argued with me about it because he wanted to see me instead. This argument lead to him saying he’d been intimate with someone in the U.K. when I had been to work and threatened to send me the evidence… 

I was obviously furious and said I would not be seeing him anymore. I blocked him but he managed to call me on a blocked number. He told me he said that to hurt me because I’d hurt his feelings by not seeing him. 

He eventually got me to meet up with him for “closure” and I went because I felt bad as he’d paid so much to visit me and spent the time etc. On this evening I told him all the reasons we couldn’t work etc etc. I then told him to be honest with me and found out he’d been intimate with 3 other girls during the time we’d been talking. I told him this was the end and walked home. 

He now is still begging to see me and I know we can’t be together because too much has happened and there are now way too many issues to overcome but I can’t help thinking. AITA for now refusing to see him at all when he has come so far and spent so much money. Will I regret not seeing him?

UPDATE: 

It’s his last day today and I got a voice mail because I’ve stopped answering the no caller ID numbers. He asked if I was sure I didn’t want to see him because it’s his last day here then proceeded to tell me “I did go on a date last night, a tinder match saved the night. We didn’t hook up but just enjoyed the night life in hammersmith. Another tinder match is wanting me to meet her at the carnival but she’s not contacting me back. Maybe she found somebody else she rather see.” Then said he was nervous about the airport. I’m not seeing him and not responding but seems I’ve definitely made the right choice cutting contact."

wzm182_2040,wzm182,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I 25-year-old female I’ve been dating my now boyfriend for 2 years when we first started dating his daughter just turned three. the first time I met his daughter and we hit it off immediately she love me and had an attachment to me right off the bat. 

I was adamant that my boyfriend tell his child’s mother that i was going to meet her because i would want to know who was around my child and i told him i was open to meeting her first if that’s what she wanted. When he told her she acted fine about it and said she didn’t need to meet me. A week weeks later his daughter came to him saying that I can’t talk about S to mommy because she doesn’t know about her. 

My boyfriend told her multiple times about our relationship she just refused to believe that it was actually happening. She felt as though me and him were dating behind her back the whole time that they were together. Even thought me and him didn’t start dating until after we joined the military which was two years after they broke up. We joined different branches and hadn’t seen each other in over a year due to deployments when we reconnected we immediately realized that we really had strong feelings for each other. 

She went on to cause more and more drama between the two of them by saying things such as she’s my daughter you’re not going to see her, you’re not gonna bring her around another woman that I don’t know, I’m her mother not her, you’re disrespecting me as her mother, she’s our child not your and hers and so on and so forth. He eventually cut off all communication unless is was specifically about their daughter which made her even more mad as they use to do things together with their daughter such as birthday party’s, “family pictures”, going to see Christmas lights things like that were completely stopped. 

He did this on his own after the way she reacted about me he realized he was sending her the wrong message by still doing things together as if they were a family for the benefit of their child. Before when they would get on bad terms she would not let him see his daughter for months at a time so he thought by doing things together it would ensure he still got to see his daughter.

 A few months later the daughter‘s birthday was coming up and he always said that when she turns a certain age he wanted to take her On a big trip. This would be her first vacation with him but not her first vacation as she’s gone on multiple trips with her mother and mothers family before this. 

When the mother asked him what he was doing for her for her birthday this year (knowing that this was the year that he always said he wanted to take her on a big trip) she invited herself on the trip saying she wouldn’t miss her child’s first family trip not knowing that I was planning the trip with him already. When he told her that I was going to be coming she flipped. 

She went on talking about how it was disrespectful that I was coming and I would be in the pictures and ruin her memories of her child’s first trip since we probably wouldn’t be together in the future i shouldn’t be there to get in any of the pictures and he’s forcing their daughter to choose. 

The argument went on for three days and he let her know in the end if I don’t go no one‘s going. She said was putting me before his child and her. He said that her feelings are no longer his responsibility and that if she wanted to take their child on a trip she can do it before he does or after he does but this trip was happening with or without her. 

She said that she wouldn’t let her child go as she has “full custody” and he can’t take her anywhere without her and she’s not going if I’m not going. I offered to just sit it out as i didn’t like to see him so upset and he told me he didn’t want to go with her alone and definitely didn’t want to go without me. He told her she was welcome to come but I’m coming too, because he wasn’t comfortable going for a week long vacation with his ex alone, and that we would all be in separate rooms and cars.

 which of course mad her livid because she wanted them to ride there together so their daughter wouldn’t have to chose between them and she brought up the fact that they had done stuff together before so why is it a problem now. He said out of respect for his relationship with me he would not go without me. So am i the ass hole for going or should i just have pushed hard to let them go on their own since our relationship is still so new?"
wzm182_2042,wzm182,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I 25-year-old female I’ve been dating my now boyfriend for 2 years when we first started dating his daughter just turned three. the first time I met his daughter and we hit it off immediately she love me and had an attachment to me right off the bat. 

I was adamant that my boyfriend tell his child’s mother that i was going to meet her because i would want to know who was around my child and i told him i was open to meeting her first if that’s what she wanted. When he told her she acted fine about it and said she didn’t need to meet me. A week weeks later his daughter came to him saying that I can’t talk about S to mommy because she doesn’t know about her. 

My boyfriend told her multiple times about our relationship she just refused to believe that it was actually happening. She felt as though me and him were dating behind her back the whole time that they were together. Even thought me and him didn’t start dating until after we joined the military which was two years after they broke up. We joined different branches and hadn’t seen each other in over a year due to deployments when we reconnected we immediately realized that we really had strong feelings for each other. 

She went on to cause more and more drama between the two of them by saying things such as she’s my daughter you’re not going to see her, you’re not gonna bring her around another woman that I don’t know, I’m her mother not her, you’re disrespecting me as her mother, she’s our child not your and hers and so on and so forth. He eventually cut off all communication unless is was specifically about their daughter which made her even more mad as they use to do things together with their daughter such as birthday party’s, “family pictures”, going to see Christmas lights things like that were completely stopped. 

He did this on his own after the way she reacted about me he realized he was sending her the wrong message by still doing things together as if they were a family for the benefit of their child. Before when they would get on bad terms she would not let him see his daughter for months at a time so he thought by doing things together it would ensure he still got to see his daughter.

 A few months later the daughter‘s birthday was coming up and he always said that when she turns a certain age he wanted to take her On a big trip. This would be her first vacation with him but not her first vacation as she’s gone on multiple trips with her mother and mothers family before this. 

When the mother asked him what he was doing for her for her birthday this year (knowing that this was the year that he always said he wanted to take her on a big trip) she invited herself on the trip saying she wouldn’t miss her child’s first family trip not knowing that I was planning the trip with him already. When he told her that I was going to be coming she flipped. 

She went on talking about how it was disrespectful that I was coming and I would be in the pictures and ruin her memories of her child’s first trip since we probably wouldn’t be together in the future i shouldn’t be there to get in any of the pictures and he’s forcing their daughter to choose. 

The argument went on for three days and he let her know in the end if I don’t go no one‘s going. She said was putting me before his child and her. He said that her feelings are no longer his responsibility and that if she wanted to take their child on a trip she can do it before he does or after he does but this trip was happening with or without her. 

She said that she wouldn’t let her child go as she has “full custody” and he can’t take her anywhere without her and she’s not going if I’m not going. I offered to just sit it out as i didn’t like to see him so upset and he told me he didn’t want to go with her alone and definitely didn’t want to go without me. He told her she was welcome to come but I’m coming too, because he wasn’t comfortable going for a week long vacation with his ex alone, and that we would all be in separate rooms and cars.

wzrjy1_2047,wzrjy1,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,The title is pretty self explanatory but I’ll give a bit of background information. I [23f] and my hubs [24m] have been together for almost six years two of them being married. We were long distance for a year and during that year our relationship truly took a hit. I had my suspicions of him cheating on me but never had any proof. We’ll today he decided to tell me the truth and I’m devastated. In all honesty I think I’m more in shock than anything else. I feel embarrassed especially since I relocated after we got married. Now this is where I might be an ass hole. I decided to go on a walk to clear my head and he did the same so I wrote a note in case he came back before me and for whatever reason he thought I was going to commit (I do have my fair share of mental health issues and have tried before). When I came back home he refused to talk to me and kept flipping me off (he is also very drunk atm). I feel like I did something wrong even though I know he’s the one who hurt me. He promised he never cheated on me after we got married it was just he thought he lost me and threw the towel in early I guess. He truly is the love of my life but I don’t know what our next steps are after this. I’m signing us up for couples therapy so hopefully we can figure this all out and work through these issues. I suppose I’m looking for advice about how to handle the situation. Part of me wants to put the past in the past especially since he changed a lot for the better since we got married but then the other part of me is just hurt and wants to go find the itchbay and fuck her up cause she knew he had a girl at home.

x03dpx_2054,x03dpx,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"So a little context; My (14F) aunt (35F) from my moms (40F) side has always been a huge fucking asshole. Nobody in the family likes her because she always begs my grandparents for money. Let's start with summer 2018. I was staying at my grandparents house for the summer because my parents had to go on a business trip, mind you my grandparents live in a small country called Azerbaijan. My grandparents have this little tradition where they go on a little vacation to other countries like Turkey or France (to visit my favourite aunt) and they always come back in the middle or start or August and they make sure to bring back some gifts from where they went to. The gifts would always be something like a new backpack, some clothes (rarely), sweets, school supplies. Since my parents are somewhat successful I can afford my own clothes and school supplies so I either get the sweets or sometimes SOME of the cool school supplies, but thats not the point. While I was at my grandparents house, they decided to go visit my other aunt in France and they asked my asshole aunt (lets call her N) to watch after the house and me. She agreed and brought her two children. I was okay with that since I don't dislike my cousins. Well on the first day everything was going okay. When it was time for bed I did my nightly routine and then walked into my grandparent's room to go to sleep (I was allowed to sleep on my grandparent's bed) when I see N laying on the bed, fast asleep with my cousins. Since I am fairly a nice person, I didn't mind at first as I thought maybe this was a one time thing. I was wrong. So instead I went to sleep in the other room which had a nice bed, but the thing is it doesn't have an AC so I was sweating all night like a pig and couldn't get a decent amount of sleep. When I was morning I woke up to my cousins crying and screaming. It was coming from the kitchen so I went there and I saw MY PHONE in their hands playing some video games and going through my texts! They were fighting about who's turn it is to play. N said ""Good morning, did you sleep okay? Also the boys took your phone to play on it for a bit, I hope you don't mind."" I walked over to my cousins and snatched the phone out of their hands which made them cry even louder and harder but I didn't care. Then N yelled out ""Why would you take the phone away?! This was the only way to keep them quiet!"" I was shocked since she NEVER had the balls to raise her voice at me. So I yelled back ""Because its MY phone not yours! and who in the world told you that it was okay to let them take my phone and go through my texts and messages?"" She gave me a dirty look and just walked away with my cousins (8M and 6M) on her hips like they were babies. I ate some breakfast, got dressed and took some of the money that my grandma left me to go buy some ice cream and bread since there was none left. I came back and N pretty much didn't pay attention to me at all. A week passed by. N made lunch and called me and my cousins down to eat lunch. I went downstairs and grabbed a bowl to pour myself some of the stew she made. I sat down on the table and started eating then N made a comment saying ""You're gonna est all that? I suggest you lower your portion. You're already fat enough so try losing some weight."" I will admit, I am fat. Im jot gonna sit here and deny it but that comment was so ignorant that it made me wanna cry so I stayed quiet because I knew if I opened my mouth I would start weeping like a baby. After that me and N pretty much ignored eachother and argued once in a while but the weight comments did not stop. After my grandparents came back, N had to leave and I was happy. After my parents came back from the trip, they picked me up and we came back home (Canada). After that me and N never really talked but whenever I would visit my grandparents, she would always be there visiting or ranting/venting to them. I remember she would always ask them for money, or tell them her husband threatened to smash her head into a window if she stopped wearing her hijab or if she ever disrespected him. N is married to a typical Azerbaijani man who is very misogynistic and overall a pedo. I hate him thats why I always try to ignore him. N would always say ""I need money"" or ""Did you transfer the money?"" Or ""I didn't get the money"" ""I need this I need that"" etc. Well before me and my family moved to canada, my parents sold N and her husband the house that they bought but never had enough money to continue building it so N and her husband finished building it themselves and shortly after, moved in there. She never calls my mom unless its to ask help about the house or something like that and my mom always feels the need to help her since shes older than N and in my culture, the eldest sibling always helps the younger sibling, and It always pisses me off how N can manipulate and guilt trip everyone she knows into giving her money. (My mom is the second oldest, fav aunt is the oldest, N is the middle and my other aunt who the youngest and is pretty much like N but not an asshole shes just married to an abusive guy) Fast forward to yesterday, the whole family from mom's side gathered to have dinner and just overall hangout. The food was ready and I helped set the table then everyone sat down to eat. As everyone started eating, I put some salad on my plate and N started saying how I should lose weight and I should stop eating so much. At this point I have had enough so I stood up, looked her dead in the eye and said ""Stop worrying about my fucking weight and start thinking about how you're gonna escape your abusive pedophile husband. And while you're at it, stop begging everyone for money you selfish fucking asshole and grow up! You are 35, so start acting like it."" and with that, I grabbed my shoes and walked out of the house. Now im getting messages from N saying I was wrong for that and that I am just overreacting and its none of my business while the rest of my family is siding with me. Am I The Asshole?"

This happened about 2 days ago…me and Nick and Jayden were at home baking cookies because Jayden wanted to make Abby’s favorite.

She did as she was told then she came into the kitchen and asked if Emma (Nicks ex) can move in with us since Emma’s ex kicked her out. I obviously said no. She said that she wasn’t talking to me. Nick said no because he knows how Emma is.

She told me that I was controlling and again turning him against his family and how he deserves better than me. Well when she was about to leave Emma showed up. When Emma came in she saw me with Nick and I have a baby bump. 

She called me an AH for “stealing the love of her life” and how I was pregnant and blah blah blah then she left. FMIL also called me an AH because Nick and Emma deserve to be together and can’t because I’m in the way. She said some things about my baby. Nick eventually kicked her out and told her to never come back till she apologizes.

x0zzso_2087,x0zzso,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (27f) am getting married in two weeks. The wedding has been planned for 10months. From the beginning my sisters (13f and 11f) were asked to be my bridesmaids and I have been so excited to have them by my side on the big day. A few days ago, my mother (47f) called to inform me that my sisters now have a cheer competion scheduled on the same day as my wedding. For context, my sisters have done competitive cheer since they could walk and they travel as a family often for it. My mother and them even missed most of my college graduation and all of my masters graduation to attend their cheer competitions, so this is not the first time this has happened on an important day for me.

 My mother wanted to make ""both work"" on my wedding day. I asked her how exactly they could travel , compete, and and make it back to be ready for the wedding on time. My mother stated my step dad would drive them and bring them back while she stayed with me, and then rush them back to take off their cheer gear and into their bridesmaid dresses right before the wedding. I told her no, that I wanted my sisters and her to be with me all day on my wedding day. Plus my fiance and I spent too much money on our big day to stress about them potentially missing it or not being ready on time for the wedding. I also told her we shouldn't even be having this conversation as she should have just informed the coach that they would not be there instead of trying to make it work because i am also her daughter. 

My mother is convinced they will get kicked off the team if they do not go (the coach has not said this). She stated that it's silly to make them not cheer for a whole year because I want to be selfish about a few hours (again, we don't know that would be the consequences of them not going) and they've had this date for 10months. I stated unless they could be back to have their hair done by 11am and be ready for pictures it would not work. The coach said that was not a possibility as they wont compete until late morning or early afternoon with an hour drive back to the venue. 

So I informed my mother that they had to choose and could not do booth. If they choose to go to the cheer competition they could not be in my wedding party and would just attend in the audience. My mother claims I am punishing my sisters for something outside of their control (but I could hear my 13y sister begging to be with me and not go to the competition in the background of the phone call). 

I fear I may the asshole by punishing my sisters, whom I love dearly, for my moms lack of planning ahead. However I am deeply hurt that she wouldn't just tell the coach no, sometimes in life you have to choose priorities and sports can't trump your daughters wedding. Nor is this the first time she has chosen their cheer over big life events of mine."

She bought all the grandkids little trees for Christmas. She always liked to look nice. She love to decorate and made my condo look less sad . She also found me a girlfriend. The lady from the wig store.Grandma loves her wigs and looking nice.

Her life was really hard but she somehow mostly was happy.

She bought all the grandkids little trees for Christmas. She always liked to look nice. She love to decorate and made my condo look less sad . She also found me a girlfriend. The lady from the wig store.Grandma loves her wigs and looking nice.

Her life was really hard but she somehow mostly was happy.

x1wsfi_2107,x1wsfi,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I (25F) and my boyfriend (26 M) have been together since high school (So about ten years). Our relationship is fantastic. We've had our ups and downs like every couple but all in all, we want to spend the rest of our lives together. With that being said, ten years with the same person is a long time. Our bedroom life was starting to slow down. Now coincidently, I started getting my period more often. When I started birth control years ago, it affected my period to the point where I wouldn't get it for months even years sometimes. After being on it for so long my period has started to regulate. This is important because I got my period in at the end of July and it lasted until Aug 5. Then I got it again on Aug 22. That's only two weeks. I told my boyfriend and he couldn't believe I got it again after only two weeks but he didn't push it. He started acting a bit strange around me for the next few days. I keep asking if everything was ok and he keep saying it was. I figured I was just imagining things and took that as period brain. During this weekend I was at home just using the bathroom sitting there on my phone. My boyfriend comes into the bathroom to brush his teeth ( Yes we walk in on each other using the bathroom, it's not gross to us, move on) I'm just sitting on the toilet, playing on my phone with my panties around my ankles. He looks down at me and just starts laughing. I ask him ""what's funny?"" After a while, he goes ""I knew it, I caught you!"" I had no idea what he was talking about but he keep going on and on about how he knew I was faking my period so I wouldn't have to have sex with him. I stop him and said, ""what makes u think I'm not on my period?"" He laughed again and pointed at my underwear and asked where my pad was and didn't I need a pad if I was really on my period. I then realized why he had been so cold to me these past few days and I saw red. I yelled at him "" You been acting like this because you think I'm faking my period to get out of sex with you? Do not know what a fucking tampon is?"" I then took it out and said ""Here catch. In case you think this is fake too"" and tossed it at him. He moved out of the way so nothing got on him. He got mad and started screaming at me about how that was disgusting and ""Unladylike"". I get that it was gross but it was in the heat of the moment. I've apologized to him and admitted I shouldn't have thrown it at him but he won't talk to me. He still hasn't apologized to me either. AITA?"

My best friend and i were recently discussing names and i told her our plans and she freaked out on me. Our sophomore year of college she was assaulted by a guy named Mike Lucas, my husband family name is Jackson Lucas Green, so my child would have the same middle name as her assaulters last name.

Okay so 4 months ago I 27 F and my now Ex then Boyfriend of 3 years David 30 M, were walking home from a pub with 6 of his coworkers 4 who were crashing at our place including Max 32 M. While walking home Max got a phone call from a coworker telling them another coworker  Maddie age 22 F was admitted to hospital. They didn't know much but said Maddie's parents who she lives with are with her. When Max told the group my boyfriend started asking a bunch of questions that Max had no way of knowing the answers to, then wanted us to rush home so we could go see her. We tried telling him that even if any of us were sober it was nearly 1 am and there was no way they would let us in especially as at the time there were still some pretty strict Covid restrictions in place for medical places. *Also in hindsight, we would have gone to the wrong hospital.* 

Once home everyone spent a bit of time checking to see if anything had been posted about Maddie. I ended up being the first to go to bed as I had work later on in the day. Apparently, others followed soon after except David who never came to bed.
I got up at 8ish assumingly after hearing Max's phone ring as he was on the phone when I entered the kitchen area. David was asleep on the couch. Once Max got off the phone with the same coworker who originally told him Maddie was in the hospital, said that the reason Maddie was in hospital was due to exhaustion and other issues due to her unknown pregnancy and was being texted more details. But she was fine and most likely would be out within 48hr. I proceeded to get ready for work even though I really didn't need to leave till 11 am and by the time I return everyone else had gathered including David who looked way more upset than anyone and really more than you'd expect for what I assumed was just a coworker relationship. *again hindsight is a beautiful thing*
David kept leaving the room I'm assuming he tried ringing either Maddie or other coworkers. Max ended up being sent more info including the fact that she'd probably be okay to leave that day and that she was at least 4 months pregnant and the baby seemed fine. 

I informed everyone I was heading to work when David flipped out and asked me how could I go to work at a time like this and that he needed my car to go see Her. *his car had broken down and was essentially not worth fixing*. I said I had to go and grabbed my keys from my pocket when he tried to grab them and shoved me into a floor-length old mirror glass panel by the door. It broke I ended up with a bunch of scratches so there was an '80s horror movie amount of blood. David booked it out the door *without my keys* after Max pulled him off of me. An ambulance was called and the cops rocked up too. Ended up being taken to the hospital *not the same one Maddie was at.* and patched up. Only needed stitches for the back of my leg and nothing was life-threatening. Was picked up from the hospital by Max who told me I was staying with him and his wife. I ended up convincing him to let me grab some thing's from my place. And I stayed with them till I was able to get an apartment, which was only a few weeks later I did not see David till maybe a week after everything happened. At this point, it had become very public knowledge that he was the father of Maddie's baby.

Fast-forward to a couple of nights ago I get a knock on my door and opened it to see David. He immediately brakes into tears explaining that Maddie had the baby and it didn't make it. I just responded "" and you came to the one person who doesn't care?"" He started saying he didn't have anyone else to go to and I kind of just closed the door on him... to be fair if I let him in I probably would have said something horrible.  I did text Max but he said David and his friendship was dead at that point.

I assume David told a couple of people who we both knew cause I got a few texts telling me I was an asshole. And I kinda feel like one but also at the same time am extremely mad that people expected me to do anything other than what I did. So AITA?


Pre answering questions I guess people will have 
No, I did not suspect any cheating 
Max claims to not have known about it either and ended a friendship of over a decade with David over this. David was Max's best man at his wedding so it was a very big friendship to end.
I work in events so there are times I may be gone for a 3day period or even a week at a time. And basic maths shows us this probably happened while I was working a Christmas event. Merry Christmas to me I guess.
No Maddie did not look pregnant. Even when she was 9 months I was told she didn't look very pregnant. 
I had met her before but do not really remember how she acted around David and vice-versa.
No I did not press charges or get a restraining order. Though the cops did get him to sign essentially what is an acknowledgement of wrongdoing which made the process of getting my name taken off the rent/bills easier. They did a report and he still may face charges. That part I'm unsure about that.
He knew my address as he dropped off more of my stuff that I couldn't take at the time.
Neither David nor Maddie still work at their old jobs.
David had never expressed wanting kids and even said he'd doesn't think he'd ever want them."
x2gtwn_2139,x2gtwn,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (26F) have a partner (32M). He's everything I've ever wanted in a man and more. He recently proposed and I said yes. We started planning the wedding right away. I was so excited to spend the rest of my life with him. That's until he brought up the prenup contract. He said it's to ""protect himself"". 

Now let me give you a little backstory. Him and I met while I was 20 and in college and him 26 and already working. He had everything going well for him. He started his own business and it's been going extremely well. He's financially well off. I graduated and struggled to find a job. I just recently found a good job and look forward to making something big out of myself. 

Now back to the story. I asked him why he would need a prenup and he said it's because he wouldn't wanna lose half of what he's worked so hard for. I understand that. I told him that I'm not comfortable with that and he asked whether I'm in it for the money. Firstly, he's always wanted kids. So I know he would expect me to get pregnant within the first year of marriage. Meaning I would have to put my life on hold and nurture those kids while he's out building his wealth. After popping 3 or 4 kids I would still be working for someone else when I could have used that time to build my own wealth. If we get divorced, I would have nothing to show for myself except the kids. And then I would leave the marriage with literally nothing. And, it's harder for a divorced mom of 3 to find love again than it is for a rich divorced father of 3. So, he would still live his life as it was. That's not an even playing field. I told him that he shouldn't expect any kids in the marriage coz of that. He went off. Said I was selfish. So I gave him 3 options.

1: Get married with no prenup and have kids. If we get divorced, we would split everything in half.
2: Get married, sign a prenup, have kids but also sign an agreement for him to pay me a monthly stipend after we divorce to take care of my needs. 
3: Get married, sign a prenup but I won't be getting pregnant. While he's out there hustling, grinding and building himself up financially, I will also be doing the same or
4: Separate if no one is willing to compromise

He went nuts when I told him this. Together with his mother. Said he doesn't agree with any of these. I honestly love him so much but I feel like he's trying to look out for himself but not allowing me to do the same. So AITAH?"

I also wanted to ask because Jen had just broken up w/ her long term bf, &amp; would bring him everywhere even if other friends asked her not to. So I would hear how upset they were &amp; how much they didn’t like him, I wanted to make sure I asked.]

Jen said: no, it’s a highschool thing, we aren’t doing a plus 1.

I didn’t go to LA, &amp; since then I had been avoiding Jen, if I visit Jan.

 In May my fiancé proposed &amp; invited a bunch of my friends. I was happy to see Jen &amp; Jan, but I felt weird being around Jen.

 I started planning who I want as bridesmaids, &amp; ofcourse I want Jan. But… I’m hesitating to add Jen because I feel like over the years we have grown apart, &amp; I’m still bothered by the Plus One comment. I feel im very sensitive about ppl liking my fiancé because my family has been so against us. 
I don’t want to overreact, &amp; I don’t want to hurt Jan for not including her twin sister in my wedding. I feel guilty cause we all grew up together, but I’ve just always been closer to Jan. 

I talked to Jan about it briefly, &amp; she basically said she wouldn’t care if Jen wasn’t a bridesmaid, but she would be hurt &amp; she doesn’t want to be in my position.

My fiancé said he would support me either way, &amp; wants me to talk to Jen before making any final decisions. He also pointed out that I seem more afraid to hurt Jan (for not having her sister),  than I am to hurt Jen (for not being a bridesmaid). I feel like Jen is only there because Jan is &amp; they are twins. How do I tell one twin I don’t want her, but I want her sister? AITA for thinking someone else deserves to be a bridesmaid because her comment bothered me so much??

UPDATE 1: I’m seeing a lot of YTA d/t projecting the feelings I have toward my family, on to Jen.

x32s91_2158,x32s91,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"READ TILL THE END PLEASE. I EDITED THIS AFTER A FEW COMMENTS MADE ME REALISE THAT I WAS WRONG. READ TILL THE END.

I (18F) and my brother (20M) grew up without a father. Our biological dad left us with our mom when I was about 6 months old. Our grandma helped our mom raise us, so we've never felt like we didn't receive enough love from our family. 

When I was 6, my mom remarried a man from another state. Their marriage didn't go too well and they soon got divorced about 2 years later. I barely remember him, but I remembered what he said before he left us. He said that he would be going for a meeting in another state and would be back in a year, but he never did. That traumatised me. I became afraid to get attached to people, only for them to leave me one day. 

Now, almost 10 years after she got divorced, my mom had found an old friend from university. They became friends again and were thinking about marriage. As far as I know, she kept in contact with him but would only talk to him from time to time. Starting about 3 months ago, they became closer. 

My mom is 51 years old. My brother and I are now in university (I just entered uni while my brother is already in his 2nd year). My brother still lives with our mom since his uni is only 30 mins from our home. I went to a uni in another state which is like 4-5 hours from home.

This man - let's call him Adam - lives about an hour from my uni. I've been living here for only a month and my mom is now visiting me. She will be here for another 4 days. 

My mom told me that she wants to marry Adam, but she wants to get her family's blessing first. Her mom (my grandma) disagreed while my brother agreed, but he was also afraid that history would repeat and our mom would get divorced again. He was willing to try to accept Adam as our mom's husband though. 

I, on the other hand, really disagreed with this idea. I don't want to have a new step dad because I was afraid that he would leave us just like my bio dad and previous step dad did. I also don't want my mom to go through the same pain again. 

My mom and I had a talk. She accepted the fact that her family didn't really want her to remarry. She told me that she was lonely and was jealous of her friends who have loving husbands and perfect families. My mom wanted to have a partner too just like everyone else, but of course she would put her family's feelings first before everything else. Even her own feelings. 

I understand that my mom wants to have a perfect family, but does she really need it? Our life is already perfect with just me, my mom, brother and grandma. But sooner or later, we would leave our home and mom would be alone. 

My mom accepted our decision, but I feel awful for being the reason why my mom can't get married with the man she loves. 

Am I being selfish for not wanting my mom to remarry just because I'm afraid that we would be left again?

EDIT: So far most people have been saying that I'm selfish. Right now, I am back at my hostel and my mom would come pick me up again tomorrow evening. I would be spending the weekend with her before she goes back home. There's plenty of time for us to talk. 

When we talked yesterday, my mom knew how mad I was and said not to think about this again. But I just can't stop thinking that I was an asshole to my mom. I said things that I shouldn't have said to her. I was an idiot, I know that. 

I've thought about what all of you said and I agree, I should think about my mom's feelings. Just because she said it's ok that I don't want her to get married, that doesn't mean she's really ok. 

She gave me everything that I wanted. Now, it's my turn to do the same thing for her. I just want the best for her. If this marriage becomes the same as the previous ones, I promise I'll be there for my mom. 

Thank you, kind strangers. I will update my story after I talk to her."

Now, almost 10 years after she got divorced, my mom had found an old friend from university. They became friends again and were thinking about marriage. As far as I know, she kept in contact with him but would only talk to him from time to time. Starting about 3 months ago, they became closer. 

My mom is 51 years old. My brother and I are now in university (I just entered uni while my brother is already in his 2nd year). My brother still lives with our mom since his uni is only 30 mins from our home. I went to a uni in another state which is like 4-5 hours from home.

This man - let's call him Adam - lives about an hour from my uni. I've been living here for only a month and my mom is now visiting me. She will be here for another 4 days. 

My mom told me that she wants to marry Adam, but she wants to get her family's blessing first. Her mom (my grandma) disagreed while my brother agreed, but he was also afraid that history would repeat and our mom would get divorced again. He was willing to try to accept Adam as our mom's husband though. 

I, on the other hand, really disagreed with this idea. I don't want to have a new step dad because I was afraid that he would leave us just like my bio dad and previous step dad did. I also don't want my mom to go through the same pain again. 

My mom and I had a talk. She accepted the fact that her family didn't really want her to remarry. She told me that she was lonely and was jealous of her friends who have loving husbands and perfect families. My mom wanted to have a partner too just like everyone else, but of course she would put her family's feelings first before everything else. Even her own feelings. 

I understand that my mom wants to have a perfect family, but does she really need it? Our life is already perfect with just me, my mom, brother and grandma. But sooner or later, we would leave our home and mom would be alone. 

My mom accepted our decision, but I feel awful for being the reason why my mom can't get married with the man she loves. 

Am I being selfish for not wanting my mom to remarry just because I'm afraid that we would be left again?

EDIT: So far most people have been saying that I'm selfish. Right now, I am back at my hostel and my mom would come pick me up again tomorrow evening. I would be spending the weekend with her before she goes back home. There's plenty of time for us to talk. 

When we talked yesterday, my mom knew how mad I was and said not to think about this again. But I just can't stop thinking that I was an asshole to my mom. I said things that I shouldn't have said to her. I was an idiot, I know that. 

I've thought about what all of you said and I agree, I should think about my mom's feelings. Just because she said it's ok that I don't want her to get married, that doesn't mean she's really ok. 

She gave me everything that I wanted. Now, it's my turn to do the same thing for her. I just want the best for her. If this marriage becomes the same as the previous ones, I promise I'll be there for my mom. 

Thank you, kind strangers. I will update my story after I talk to her."

So moving on to the story, my(17 F) mother (35 F) insists on demanding that I sleep in the same bed with her because she feels lonely.  For some background, my mother had me when she was 18 and since my grandma kicked her out and my dad left us only to return three years later( but that’s a whole other story , we haven’t talked in a couple of  years) my mom had to go work abroad and made great sacrifices for me to have a comfortable life which means that I was always living in my origin country with  someone who would take care of me and I would be with my mom on like holidays( we would still talk many times a day every single day), this happened until four  years ago when we moved to Italy together and have lived together ever since. So growing up this way I always had to adapt to new changes( My mom would often employ a different person to take care of me almost every year and while sometimes I lived in that lady’s home( this happened if she was married and had children and therefore couldn’t move), other times they would come live in ours. This situation also had me change school a couple times) so you can understand that I now have some problems getting too attached to people, places or situations and I kinda grew up to be a reserved and lonely person and I really don’t mind it, I mean I enjoy being with other people but I just really need a lot of space and privacy. So my mom has never had luck in friendships or relationships ( there is this one guy but the situation is very complicated) so it’s only the two of us at home and she constantly tells me how lonely she feels. Problem is she is very possessive of me (I cannot have a boyfriend or event talk to boys and she is also kinda weird about my female friends) and she still views me like a child and complains about how we don’t spend a lot of time together and made this rule that once a week I have to sleep with her and that time is usually on Fridays. So tonight she came in my bedroom and we talked a bit and then she sat on my bed and said “ Will you come sleep with me tonight?” and I said that I wouldn’t because it’s not Friday and then she said “How about if I come and sleep with you?”, I said no again so she got mad and was like “what, are u disgusted by your own mother ?”, I told her  of course I’m not and that I just sleep more comfortably alone and she just got mad and left. Now this happens very often and she often even complaints to her relatives that I’m a very distant person and sometimes even compares me  to my cousin who is my age and is “such a sweet and loving daughter “ and says I’m nothing like her and that I’ll probably end up alone because “ I don’t know how to keep people around me”. I really am sorry that she feels alone but sometimes she is just too much to handle (she always talks about herself and complaints about everything and I’m already kinda anxious on my one, can’t really deal with someone else’s problems too, and believe me they are many, some serious, some absolutely insignificant and some should really not be discussed with your daughter) to the point that she drains me of energy. If you need more info tell me and I’ll answer but for now, AITA for telling her that I would not go sleep with her ?"

For the past week I've been getting up with the baby when she wakes up. No help from my wife which is fine as it's pretty easy, change the diaper, feed her, and she's usually back to sleep within an hour. 

Today, however, I was feeling extremely tired when the baby woke up at 0730. Her crying woke both me and my wife up. Since I was extra tired, I asked my wife if she could get up with her. This led to a 15 or 20 minute long argument about it. She proceeded to get up and call me a piece of shit and said I'm not even back to work yet since I'm on paid paternity leave, she says I never do anything around the house either, which for the most part is true, except for the fact my wife prefers to clean and organize since she's much more thorough with it. I ended up telling her off about how I still have my job, and her current job is a stay at home mother. I laid in silence after this, but she still mumbled about how I'm a piece of shit evidently. So, am I the asshole?

Edit: last night was a typical night so I'm going to add it in for context.
I was up with the baby until about 2 am this morning. I then woke up with her again around 6 am, followed by her waking up again around 10 am. I was with the baby from then til about 2 pm when my wife woke up. My wife said she'd take the baby for the rest of the day so I could have some down time. 4 pm roles around and she texts me saying she needs help.

Before the pandemic hit, I wanted to leave my bf (45). Why? He had a wife of 7 years and didnt told me. And now the wife wanted a divorce and sent him back to the UK since they are not together anymore.

For context, this was 2 years ago, meaning I was with my bf for 5 years before I knew (still LDR, I was flying each month too see him overseas).

Whenever we go out, I pay for everything. Drinks, food, hotels etc.

When we go out for drinks, if I trigger something, I'd end up crying because he'll cuss at me and say hurtful things to me.

Once we went out bec it was my bday and we had a fight because a chinese stranger helped him with the soda machine with cash and i said its a nice gesture and he went on a big rant that the money was from chinese sweatshops and if I want to that the stranger is nice, maybe I should f\*\*k that guy instead.

Anyway, after the divorce, I didnt left. Why? Because bf said that I was the greatest woman in his life etc and i was the reason of the divorce. I got caught in the middle of ""I still love him"" and ""I got no choice now since they got a divorce because of me.

Now two years passed (present time), im paying for his subscriptions for his ""business"". Paying $500 annual for shit I dont use. He doesnt earn on the business he's building for 15 years. He's a indie game developer.

Now, since we  always have video calls, its silence for 7 hours in a 7.5 hours call. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I cant stay shit bec it might trigger the wrong things. I'm like walking on eggshells around him.

He would send me some memes, funny videos, his work, explain his work, what he did, coding, programming etc.

And me? Cant say shit. If I talk about my problems, its none of his business. If I ask how is day was, ""meh"", if I ask about what happened to his day, same.

My work? No. Because my work is too easy and even 5 year old can do it (i have an ig growth business).

I honestly stopped telling him about what I do, learnings, and how it can help him on his work and basically I just say hi, send memes and doesnt share things that much anymore

Recently, I've reconnected with a close friend. It was just a  breeze. It was so easy and we felt that there was a connection.

I invited my friend over for a coffee in my apt, and it escalated. We had sex, cuddles, and kisses (my bf doesnt cuddle and just smokes after we have sex), so this was big for me and I really like it. My friend mentioned that he wants to try it out and he wants us to start dating, and I said yes.

I realised I didnt had to settle for less and I can have someone who wants me, talk to me, know my work, ask my day was and actually have a conversation about what I think and someone who actually cares about me.

Now, AITA for cheating and wanting to breakup with my bf.

PS. I just feel that everything I've been bottling up for years has exploded and I just want to leave the relationship.  


Update: I broke up with him in chat, then blocked him all over"

Anyway, after the divorce, I didnt left. Why? Because bf said that I was the greatest woman in his life etc and i was the reason of the divorce. I got caught in the middle of ""I still love him"" and ""I got no choice now since they got a divorce because of me.

Now two years passed (present time), im paying for his subscriptions for his ""business"". Paying $500 annual for shit I dont use. He doesnt earn on the business he's building for 15 years. He's a indie game developer.

Now, since we  always have video calls, its silence for 7 hours in a 7.5 hours call. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I cant stay shit bec it might trigger the wrong things. I'm like walking on eggshells around him.

He would send me some memes, funny videos, his work, explain his work, what he did, coding, programming etc.

And me? Cant say shit. If I talk about my problems, its none of his business. If I ask how is day was, ""meh"", if I ask about what happened to his day, same.

My work? No. Because my work is too easy and even 5 year old can do it (i have an ig growth business).

I honestly stopped telling him about what I do, learnings, and how it can help him on his work and basically I just say hi, send memes and doesnt share things that much anymore

Recently, I've reconnected with a close friend. It was just a  breeze. It was so easy and we felt that there was a connection.

I invited my friend over for a coffee in my apt, and it escalated. We had sex, cuddles, and kisses (my bf doesnt cuddle and just smokes after we have sex), so this was big for me and I really like it. My friend mentioned that he wants to try it out and he wants us to start dating, and I said yes.

I realised I didnt had to settle for less and I can have someone who wants me, talk to me, know my work, ask my day was and actually have a conversation about what I think and someone who actually cares about me.

Now, AITA for cheating and wanting to breakup with my bf.

PS. I just feel that everything I've been bottling up for years has exploded and I just want to leave the relationship.  


Update: I broke up with him in chat, then blocked him all over"

x6k6km_2262,x6k6km,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"okay so for context i’ve been with my boyfriend for about 9 months now. i love him and he’s usually very sweet to me but sometimes he takes his pent up anger out on me through “play fighting” but it’s too rough and he often leaves bruises since i’m only 5’0 and very petite. i’ve talked to him about being a little more chill with me but he hasn’t stopped. well the other day he came over and later at night we decided to go on a walk with the dog. he looked at me and said “there’s a mosquito on your face” so i brushed where he has said with my hand, there was nothing there, then he said “it’s still there” and proceeded to smack my face. hard. so i pushed him away lightly and said “that hurt”. he didn’t like that and punched me really hard right on my spine making me jolt forward holding back tears. i say “that hurt like a mf why’d you hit that hard” he dismissed me and said it was just a small tap to get me back for shoving him. fast forward a few days and my back is still in immense pain so i go to the doctor, they do a few tests and tell me that i have a dislocated disk in my back where he hit and i have a big bruise. this is not the first time where his “playful taps” have been pretty severe and i’m honestly tired of it, i don’t think he’s abusive just too rough. i’ve talked to a few friends about the situation and said i wanted to leave him bc of that and some other issues in the relationship but they said i was overreacting and that’s just what men do. so would i be an AH if i leave him?

update 1: i’ve read all of your comments and concerns and decided that i am going to leave him tomorrow when i have a safe place to go. i still don’t think he’s abusive but maybe that’s just me trying to justify his actions :/ i’ll update again when i do it

update 2: i tried leaving him this morning while im staying with a friend for the week, he started getting angry and telling me im throwing away months of my life over some “play fighting” and he got defensive saying i was a shit gf then threatening to leak person information about me that i trusted him with to my friends and family if i went through with leaving him. i’m not sure what to do now should i go through with leaving him and just face the consequences?? also, i’m not taking it to the police because he has a lot of power and it would just be swept under the rug. i just don’t want to go through all of that.

last update for now: i left him im in a safe place and ive compiled evidence of bruising over the last few months so if he tries to blackmail me again i will be pressing charges. thank you all for your support i feel a lot lighter and happier now and after looking through all the videos and pictures i have of the bruising i can see how it was definitely not okay. love you all and thank you again for all the support. i’ll update again if something else happens :)"

During this time my mother's best friend (55) had lost her mother through natural causes and a week after my sister's passing we attended her mother's funeral. Later that night we went back to her house with my mom and began discussing my sister's funeral arrangements. My sister's arms needed to be covered with long sleeves because of the aftermath the illness took on her body. My mom picked out a white blazer, white fruffly shirt, and white long skirt for my sister. I respectfully advocated for my sister that the outfit was far too outdated for her and we should find something that better suits her age and style. My Aunt (mom's best friend) interjected saying the funeral isn't about the person that died and rather the family and that she saw nothing wrong with the outfit picked. I rebuttalled that the outfit should be something she would of worn and it should represent her style. My ""Aunt"" went on to say that I was being disrespectful and called me ""evil"", ""satan"" and a ""Satanist"" for what in my opinion is me advocating for my sister and not allowing her to wear something I could see my 89 year old grandmother wearing on Easter with her Sunday best hat. I told her she was being rude and disrespectful and she said I was putting stress on my mother who sat quietly during the entire ordeal.

Note: I spoke with my mom and addressed how I felt when she didn't intervene and I have since forgiven her and my dad was livid and agreed she was wrong.

I also didn't choose to go off on her, because my aunts 3 sons were my sisters pallbearers and I didn't want to jeopardize that. 

Since then we have not spoke about it, we hardly talk, and she has since tried to give me a gift on my birthday which I declined due to the principle that if I accept a gift from her then I am accepting what she said to me was no longer still an issue.

We did find an outfit from my sister closet later on that worked way better than the original choice."

I feel like that would really kill her to know, but on the other hand I'm not being totally honest.  I figured it didn't matter of I said it, because it's not like you can change your chemistry, so I'm trying to save her feelings.  AITAH for not divulging this full information to her?"

I (29m) have two siblings, Colby 31m and Kelly 25f. Both fake names.

Growing up, Colby and Kelly always had a special bond, and I was the outlier. Of course I did my fair share of dumb shit, but whenever my brother did something wrong, he'd go get my sister, convince her I did the thing, and they'd go to my parents. Being 2 VS 1, they had no reason not to believe my siblings, but as a result, I spent a large amount of time being punished for things I didn't do.

This resulted in my brother being the golden boy, and myself being labeled as the difficult problem child.

The favoritism was and still is not subtle.

To make a long story short, Colby used to come into my room at night and molest me in my sleep. I used to wake up with my underwear around my ankles anywhere between 2 - 5 times a week. I have several vivid memories of waking up while Colby made a hasty exit out of my room.

There was at least one rape. Possibly more.

Some of the memories are very hazy being that I was either asleep, or just waking up. But I used to have wet dreams CONSTANTLY as a kid/teenager. You should be able to draw the correct conclusion from that.

Anyway, time moved on and so did I. I did my best to forgive and forget for the sake of my family. I didn't want to ruin anything we had going, which was actually really good for a while.

We just kept the closet shut so to speak.

About a year and a half or so ago, it came out that a family member, George (real name) was molesting and raping all of his kids, and had even groped Kelly a few times.

He was ejected from the family, and rightfully so.

During that time I opened up to Kelly about what Colby had done to me all growing up. We had a long heartfelt discussion, and things were good. Since then, we had a few other talks about the whole subject, mentioning Colby by name.

Now for the implosion.

Something personal happened which triggered myself and my wife to set a boundary with Colby. I went to him and him alone. Directly to him and told him we would not be allowing him to come around our two children, 5 and 7, until he owned up to what he did, apologized, and he and I went to therapy together to work through our issues and heal our relationship.

He went absolutely ballistic. Playing dumb, denying, gaslighting, victim blaming, guilt tripping, ect. If you can imagine a guilty behavior, he took it.

He then blocked me, and drove to my sister's house. He was balling and crying, saying I was teaming up with his Ex to destroy his life.

The last thing Kelly ever said to me was that Colby deserves to be heard out.

Afterwards, she blocked me on all social media and blocked my phone.

Colby also ran crying to my parents with the same sob story. They both initially believed him, but since speaking with me they're undecided.

My dad said he has a hard time believing me because he doesn't want it to be true. Which, it's good that he at least admits it, but it's not good enough.

My mom more or less believes me, but continues having contact with Kelly and Colby, stating that, ""I need to support you both,"" and, ""This is happening to BOTH my sons.""

So my sister blatantly chose my abuser knowing FULL well what he did to me, going so far as to cut contact with me and my family. And my parents are being chicken shit, saying they won't choose sides and they need to support us both because we both are having a rough time with this.

Everyone has cut ties with me except my mother. But she tells us all about the family as if nothing is going on.

Colby outright refuses to speak with me, and because I know Kelly very, very well, I know she's talking shit about me whenever she gets the chance.

The betrayal is very, very deep. And it's a wound I don't know will ever heal. The anger, rage, hate, despair, loneliness, sadness, sorrow, and loss are deep. I'm grieving the loss of my family.

I didn't know life could be so hollow.

So Reddit, Am I The Asshole?

TLDR: my brother habitually molested and raped me all throughout my childhood/teen years. My family knows the truth and decided to cut me out of the family instead of him."
x8ggkr_2323,x8ggkr,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"For backstory, I (36M) had been married to my now deceased wife (35F) for 7 years. We were your typical high school sweethearts, we were each other’s first everything. We met in tenth grade, It was like an instant spark. However, when my wife went to college she met her best friend (34F). We went to the same college so we were on the same campus and I saw her often. We got on like a house on fire. Fast forward 9 years, me and my wife are happily married.

Right after my 30th birthday, we started trying for a baby. We were struggling to get pregnant but we blamed it on ovulation. A year later, we went to a fertility clinic and they referred us to the hospital, where my wife was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This came as a shock and she was declining quickly. After the first 5 months of her diagnosis, she was already bed bound. Her best friend would come by everyday to see her without fail. I admired how caring she was. Her best friend and I took great comfort in one another, we were both losing our best friend. She started coming by to the house to check on me. I would see her more than my own family. One night, shortly before my wife died we were drinking and one thing led to another. I didn’t realise what I had done until the next morning. We both agreed that it was a mistake and it would never happen again. A short while later, my wife sadly passed away. It destroyed me but I planned her funeral as quick as possible. The ceremony was beautiful. All of her favourite things were there. I honestly couldn’t contain myself for the whole funeral. At the funeral afters, I was talking to my wife’s best friend for the whole event. While everyone was making their speeches, I had to go outside as it was too overwhelming. She quickly followed me out. I went into the bathroom for a tissue and she followed me in and again one thing led to another. I couldn’t stop thinking about how my wife would’ve felt the whole time. People were getting suspicious and questioning us both on where we were. Ever since the funeral we’ve been secretly hooking up. My family and my wife’s family have confronted me on how close me and my wife’s best friend are. It’s even caused blow out arguments between me and my wife’s family. Her brother saw that my wife’s best friend was sending me a flirty text message. He confronted me about it and her family won’t speak to me. I miss my wife however, I want to make it official but at what cost. AITA?"
x8ks67_2328,x8ks67,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"To start this off, I must mention that my dog, Juniper, is really agressive towards people, being mistreated by her old owners, it took me a long time to get her to trust me, we are working on getting her used to people and she would tolerate people to an extent at the point of this story..

I(18F) was walking Juniper like I did every afternoon, as we were walking, I see a woman and a kid walk close to me, my dog, a rather large golden Husky, was getting agitated by how close they were, I could tell as she was tugging on her leash trying to get away from the people getting close. Naturally, I voiced for my dog, saying, ""Could you please step back, your making my dog uncomfortable"" 

The woman didn't say anything as her kid reached out to pet Juniper, who at this point was starting to growl. I voiced my concerns, saying, ""you can't pet her, she bites"" tugging my dog away from the kids reach, the kid started throwing a hissy fit as he started screaming and crying. The womans face was red, she screamed at me, ""How DARE you?!"" I was baffled. ""How dare you not let my son pet your dog! He has every right to!"" I kept my composure, ""ma'am, not only did he try to pet MY dog without permission, I also stated that she bites"" I said calmly, while my dogs growling wasn't getting quieter. ""I don't care, let my son pet your dog or I'm calling the cops!"" Now, this was what kind of scared me, even though I knew it was a bluff. ""I already told you!"" I said, wrapping my dog's leash around my wrist, ""She's a very agressive dog, of your son tries to pet him she will bite!""

""I doubt a fluffy dog would hurt anybody! Haven't you heard of the bigger the dog, the kinder they are!?"" She was screaming at this point, attracting the attention of alot of people. ""I know, and that's not the case of all dogs-"" I tried to speak but the Karen got in my face and it took all my strength to hold my now barking dog back.

""Fine, he can pet her, but if she bite-"" before I could finish my sentence, the Karen's son tears had dried up and he was reaching out once again to pet Juniper. Juniper suddenly lurched forward and bit the kids hand, I was dragged slightly  forward, the kid started screaming, and I commanded Juniper to let go, which she obliged. The Karen screamed bloody murder at the bite mark on her son's hand, ""Your dog just bit my son!"" She screamed as if it weren't obvious, ""I told you she bites, that's on you, it's your fault your son got hurt"" I promptly turned on my heel and left.

Later on the police arrived at my house, the Karen called the cops on me and I had to explain the situation. I got off with a warning thankfully, but am I the asshole?"

This has happened several times. I've worked on my tone and how I say things and nothing's worked. Yesterday we made a chore list for ourselves to do. I was going to sweep, mop, do the dishes, clean the microwave, and dust as well. She was going to do laundry and organize the room. I'm fine with that because I hate laundry. I woke up this morning and got started on cleaning, finished the dishes and sweeping and dusting. In order to mop i need the mop head washed. so I hop on Minecraft for about an hour and I ask her to throw it in for me. She then says she doesn't want to do it anymore. Obviously I'm a bit upset. So I tell her that I'll handle it and ask if she could just give me the space I need to clean. I get distracted very easily so most things make me forget about cleaning.  She starts crying and saying that she wants to feel needed and that I'm the one at fault. Now she's getting her parents to pick her up. So am I the asshole for wanting space to clean?"

Let me preface this by saying when we started dating last year, I had a large sum of money and me being 18, I spoiled the crap out of him and now I think he’s in this mindset that I always have money and I don’t. Anyway, in the last 6 months he has become codependent on me and become super lazy. He constantly calls out of work for a headache but then stays at home playing video games all day. He doesn’t feed the dog if I am home, or when he does he makes the dog wait until he is ready to get off his game. He was unemployed for nearly a month, and he refused to do DoorDash or Uber or anything to get caught up on his bills, I ended up taking on a lot of weight so he could be lazy. I’ve mentioned and talked to him about this countless times. He never wants to go to my family events with me but I am required to go to his family events. 

He is rude to all of my family and friends, and talks to me like I am stupid. He still acts like such a child when he doesn’t get his way. I feel more like a babysitter than his girlfriend. Recently I got an opportunity to move a couple hours away to get my career started in the field I want, because those opportunities are not present where we are. I talked to him about it and he said he wouldn’t do long distance unless I planned to move back soon, because he wants to me WITH me all the time. But I don’t plan to move back. I asked him if the opportunity arose, would he move with me and he said no. We’ve talked about moving to another country together so it makes me wonder if all of that was just talk and if he even meant it. He wants to be a SAHD, and I’m worried if I stay, we will have kids, and I’ll come home from work and the baby will be forgotten about because he’s “tired” or on his damn games again. He can’t provide the life I want. I want animals, and horses and to be a stay at home mom with my kids and and live on a farm. I’m terrified I’m going to get stuck with him.

She pointed to her friend beside her (sophomore) He asked did I want his Snapchat and I told him sure. He typed in his name but it didn’t pop up. He told me to try again later I told her okay and we went to get our instruments. It turns out the reason why his name didn’t pop up was because I had him blocked from the year before. When I was in 8th grade he sent me a very out of pocket message so I blocked him. I unblocked him thinking maybe he changed. Anyways, after band we went to lunch and he tried to walk by me. I had only known this guy for 2 hours at this point so I wasn’t ideally comfortable around him. At lunch I usually sit with my friend (freshman) we’ll call her Maddie. That day however my other friend (freshman) we’ll call her Sierra told us to sit with her, her boyfriend, and her cousin so we did. She kept going on about how I should dare the guy who came up to me. I didn’t even know his name until this point. We’ll call him Mike. Saying things like, “You two would be a power couple.” “He’s a good guy.” Etc. I told her I didn’t have anything against him I just didn’t want to be in a relationship. Is that so bad? Maddie was trying to tell her to calm down. The next day he texted me and started complimenting me in unusual ways. One that’s really memorable was “I just got sent an angel from heaven.” Then he was asking things like “Do you want me to walk with you before school, to band, from band, and after school?”, “Is your bus list for away games full? Do you think by next week we’ll be close enough so I can sit with you?” He was just asking so many questions and trying to rush things. I had already told him by this time I wasn’t interested in him and he said we could just be friends which I was okay with. I even told him I’m a shy person and it will take a while getting used to him. He asked me, “How long is a while because I’m really trying.” I told him I don’t know. The next day I was walking to lunch with Maddie when Mike came up to me out of nowhere. Then Sierra walked up to us and started saying thing like, “You two would be so cute.” “You two would be a power couple.” “Y’all two should date.” And etc. This was making me very uncomfortable and I told her that but she continues to do it. When school ends I walk with my best friend (freshman) we’ll call her Anna. I was walking up to Anna when Mike came out of nowhere and started walking with me. I told Anna about him and she doesn’t like him. (Same with Maddie) I show signs of discomfort around him but I guess he doesn’t notice or doesn’t care. He texts me constantly and acts really weird.

When I was in 8th grade he sent me a very out of pocket message so I blocked him. I unblocked him thinking maybe he changed. Anyways, after band we went to lunch and he tried to walk by me. I had only known this guy for 2 hours at this point so I wasn’t ideally comfortable around him. At lunch I usually sit with my friend (freshman) we’ll call her Maddie. That day however my other friend (freshman) we’ll call her Sierra told us to sit with her, her boyfriend, and her cousin so we did. She kept going on about how I should dare the guy who came up to me. I didn’t even know his name until this point. We’ll call him Mike. Saying things like, “You two would be a power couple.” “He’s a good guy.” Etc. I told her I didn’t have anything against him I just didn’t want to be in a relationship. Is that so bad? Maddie was trying to tell her to calm down. The next day he texted me and started complimenting me in unusual ways. One that’s really memorable was “I just got sent an angel from heaven.” Then he was asking things like “Do you want me to walk with you before school, to band, from band, and after school?”, “Is your bus list for away games full? Do you think by next week we’ll be close enough so I can sit with you?” He was just asking so many questions and trying to rush things. I had already told him by this time I wasn’t interested in him and he said we could just be friends which I was okay with. I even told him I’m a shy person and it will take a while getting used to him. He asked me, “How long is a while because I’m really trying.” I told him I don’t know. The next day I was walking to lunch with Maddie when Mike came up to me out of nowhere. Then Sierra walked up to us and started saying thing like, “You two would be so cute.” “You two would be a power couple.” “Y’all two should date.” And etc. This was making me very uncomfortable and I told her that but she continues to do it. When school ends I walk with my best friend (freshman) we’ll call her Anna. I was walking up to Anna when Mike came out of nowhere and started walking with me. I told Anna about him and she doesn’t like him. (Same with Maddie) I show signs of discomfort around him but I guess he doesn’t notice or doesn’t care. He texts me constantly and acts really weird. I don’t feel comfortable around him but I’m afraid to tell him to leave me alone or at least just tone it down. There is more but this is getting way to long. Sorry if there are any grammar mistakes."

My Husband has a female co worker who is making me extremely uncomfortable. (Not worried about my husband cheating). When I met her a few years ago she was asking my husband to hang out with me. I hung out with her two times and that was it. She made a catty comment about my hair and I was done at that point however more happened after that. She every once in a while asks me to go out and hang out with her but I always decline because at this point I’m uncomfortable. She out of nowhere made “hope Chests” for my kids which are apparently boxes with things like dishes, pots and pans for my kids when they turn 18 and move out. She also has referred to herself as Aunt to my kids. I feel like this is weird since we are not close to her. She has flirted with BOTH of my brother in laws (husbands brothers) and I learned a few months ago that she slept with one of them. She felt it was appropriate to tell my husband about it after he told her he was going to brother in law’s bachelor party and literally told him he was “top 3” 🤮. My brother in law said she basically started when he was sleeping and drunk. He didn’t want her but he didn’t stop her. She’s constantly oversharing with my husband. She’s told him how she wants multiple boyfriends outside of her relationship with her husband but her husband won’t let her. Also that her husband ignores her sexually to play video games and doesn’t please her. Now she is getting divorced from her husband and has told my husband she’s going to start an only fans to pay her bills. She has also said that her soon to be ex is all upset because she is already sleeping with people and the divorce isn’t finalized. She told my husband it’s not her exs Business who she’s sleeping with. Which is between them but like WHY are you telling all of this stuff to my husband?! Would I be the ass hole for calling her out? She’s crossed so many boundaries and I’m to the point where I just literally want to tell her to keep her distance from my husband kids and I and that she needs to stop telling my husband about her sex life. That I’m not interested in being her friend and that I don’t like her? It’s so frustrating to have him have to listen to this shit every day at work. I have a high suspicion she’s interested in my husband at this point. Also when I first met her she said that all of the other wife’s of the men she works with won’t hang out with her because they’re jealous of her and think that she’s trying to steal their husbands. Now I’m starting to understand why…"

The doctor said it’s chlamydia, I was so pissed off in that very moment because I had not slept with anyone but him, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell him because it broke me apart so I told his sweet momma. She immediately called him and started to cuss him out. His mom said she would take him out of the will and have his car towed. So he called me and blew up my phone just to say I’m the asshole..

EDIT 
hey guys thanks for all the funny comments giving me a laugh.  For some unanswered questions we had been together for 6 years, he definitely did not have the std before we met. Yes I did dump him. I did apologize to him for bringing his mom into the situation when he got his stuff back, he did in fact confirm he was cheating on me. Me and his mom had a long talk about this post this morning and she was glad that I brought the situation to her, she did say in hind sight I should have talked to him first, but she said she would not change her decisions.

So at the moment, me and my girlfriend are LDR. I’m employed, she is not. Lately she has been sleeping for like 18-19 hours a day, and leaving us maybe 1-2 hours to text or talk otp, at Most. I told her if she could try and sleep a little less as I wanted more time with her. She said it’s crazy that I’m asking her “not to sleep” but I don’t mind if she sleeps normally or even around 10-12 hours everyday.. but sleeping for almost 20 hours sometimes straight everyday? And not hearing from her at all? It just makes it feel like I don’t have a girlfriend. AITA for expressing this and wanting her to sleep less? Maybe I’m being too controlling?


Additionally I am also about worried about her health, I’ve told her I’m concerned about how much she sleeps as it’s not normal  and I’d pay for her doctors visit and she gets mad and says she doesn’t wanna get checked and it’s normal etc, so I’m at a loss here."

xbds79_2389,xbds79,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"So, here's the story. I am turning 16 soon, but my nan and grandad are on holiday for my birthday so they thought it would be nice to take me out to dinner before they leave. They told my mom they had four seats reserved, two for my nan and grandad, one for more. The last seat would be for whoever I wanted to invite, so I invited my partner.

Now, my brother is always spoiled by my nan and grandad. There was an actual valid reason (my mom and dad divorced so I would visit my family down south while my brother is my step dads child so he would get spoiled by my nan and grandad). But now I dont visit them, they still don't treat me fairly or the same. My brothers birthday was some time in August, and they also took him out, but I wasn't invited, as I expected because its HIS birthday meal and his chance to spend time with my nan and grandad.

Skip to the day of my post-birthday meal, I got ready and brought my partner round as we waited to be taken to the place we would eat at. My grandad got here and asked where my brother is, because HE was the fourth person who was supposed to be coming. Not only did they expect me to share my day with him after he gets his own day to himself, but they just assumed who I would bring with me without even asking. And no matter what I said, they insisted that he comes and that they could just ""grab a fifth chair for my partner"".

The entire time wasso uncomfortable because they hardly spoke to me and even walking there my grandad spent more time chatting with my brother then they did to me at all. We got home and my brother went upstairs, not even thanking them. It was clear he only came for the food. So I went off and had a go at them saying its not fair how I had to share today with him even though it was supposed to be me spending time with my nan and grandad while celebrating my birthday and that because I never intruded on his meal, why should he get to intrude on mine? I was promptly called an asshole and horrible to my brother, so I just went to my room and cried.

So reddit, Am I The Asshole?"

I (15)F am dating another (15)F, she is vegan whereas I love all types of meat and could never give it up. I understand most vegans arguments and some are valid points, such as the fact some killing methods are disgusting and inhumane. However I try my best when I shop for meat to make sure they lived a somewhat long and happy life and where killed in a humane way. 

My girlfriend comes from a quite rich family who are able to afford the luxuries and expensive vegan options, whereas I come from a lower/working class family. I grew up on a farm in the middle of no where, surrounded by a bunch of fields and forests. I grew up quite close to my family and hunting for food was one of our bonding methods. We cover ourselves in mud, grab weapons such as g^ns and kn^ves and go out to hunt. We take out the animals in one shot and make sure they don’t feel much pain when it happens. But that isn’t the issue. I was talking with a few of my friends and my girlfriends about the animals I have killed before. One of which was a cow, the cow in particular had quite bad anger issues and was very very aggressive with no warning. My at the time (4)F cousin had gotten into the field that the cow was in and was sat by the fence. It took me a moment to realise that she was behind the fence and by the time I had realised the cow had already noticed her. She started running towards my cousin to hurt her. Out of impulse I had no other option as I wasn’t close enough to grab my cousin and save her and if I had ran I wouldn’t have made it. I shot the cow and it went down, I then ran over and got my cousin out of the field and to her older brother. I then went to check on the cow and she was dead. I usually don’t kill animals unless it’s for food but I feel as if I’m that situation but I had no other option. When I told this try to my girlfriend and friends she went ballistic on me and started accusing me of being a self righteous asshole with no morals.

My wife hates it when I don’t make a facial expression when she does the little pranks and she always calls me way too serious and she blames it on my race I’m Russian and that makes me very angry and usually have arguments about it since we have no reason to talk about my race in the first place.

My in-laws are more mature than my wife they rarely prank but when my wife was a child they Pranked her every day so that’s how she basically grew up so she’s going to do it to me either way. I grew up in a very strict family who rarely smiled and never showed a love and affection so you can probably guess how I turned out but either way I knew my family loved me so it was no big deal for me growing up but my wife on the other hand when she first met my family she started berating me saying that they don’t love me and they will never love our family and that I lied etc.

At least two or three years after we got married we had our first child Rome he was such a sunshine and I loved him with all my heart I knew that it will be wrong for me to treat him how my family treated me since all kids are different so I decided to show him love and affection instead of just telling him and my wife was super pissed she said that I never showed her this type of love and why did I change for a kid etc I don’t see why she didn’t think I would change for our child since now we have a family of our own and I don’t need my son hating me.

When my son was eight years old my wife really wanted to get drunk and decided that she was going to go out and called a babysitter for my son while I was at work she ended up calling her sister who at the time was at least just turning 21 and she was already drinking that day and my wife didn’t care and just decided to leave as sister-in-law was watching him she locked him down in the basement and brought one of her male friends to my house and started having s*x in my bed. I came home three hours later hearing my son screaming and crying while I seen my room door wide-open I ran down to the basement and sure enough it was my son and when I went to my room there she was I am mediately kicked her out link spam to my wife’s phone she didn’t answer until a day later and I lost it on her I yelled at her about what had happened with her sister and she could’ve just called me but she denied everything and fell asleep.

Now our son is 15 and he has crippling anxiety, social anxiety with PTSD we recently moved from Moscow to Las Vegas and my son is not adapting easily to it he misses my family back in Moscow and he absolutely hates it here his mom forces him to hang out with her and a shit ton of her friends thanking that it’s going to help when really it’s not my son is a quiet kid and he does not like when people force him to talk and that’s exactly what his mom does and her friends so he prefers to hang out with me more and my wife hates it she tells her friends lies saying that I’m purposely trying to make him love me more when in reality she knows what she’s doing.

My wife recently got back into planking but they’ve been so little so I didn’t think anything of it I told Rome that I was going to be right back since I had to go get him some more clothes and he didn’t feel too good so he was going to stay back home he was just watching TV about to call his grandma on my side and my wife had enough of it she decided to “prank him “by locking him in a closet and scaring the living fuck out of him and bring back all the memories and he started screaming and crying he then started having a panic attack and when I came home I seen my wife laughing her ass off outside of the closet door and then when she seen me she immediately opened it my son ran towards me and gave me a hug and me and my wife started having an argument.

She said that it wasn’t that bad and my son was just being overdramatic and she said I have no reason to be mad since it was only for a few minutes but I was gone for 30 so I doubt it but there is a possibility that it could be true our argument got more heated and heated until I had enough and I told my son to pack his bags and we’re going to stay at a hotel my wife told her whole family what happened and now they’re blaming it on me they’re saying that maybe if I wasn’t such a shit head of a father his memories would’ve went away. Again I doubt that it would have but I don’t care anymore I am so close to buying some tickets to go to Moscow until this whole thing stops so Rome could be happy and hopefully get what happened off his mind.

But what they’ve been saying does have me curious am I really that horrible of a father for getting mad at my wife for locking our son in the closet? AITA"

Discussed other more loving gestures He could yous if he felt the need to randomly touch me.   This always works for like 3 days before he falls back in his ""normal"" behaviour. 

So this time he tickeld my foot. I don't even know why I sl@@pt him I just did. I think it was bild up frustration ? 

Whe have 2 kids together  but he is now doubting the relationship.  Is making me feel like everything I do is bad. I can't do anything right. I feel like me breathing is annoying to him now. 

I know he has a right to be angry with me but where do I draw the line? 

And I didn't what to bring it in but doing it anyway. 
After our first daughter was born he sort of cheated on me ?  Like  he felt lonely because I was handling the baby al the time.  And he felt the need to talk to other people. No problem there. But he talks to girl. 
Sending and receiving nudes. And he came clean about it to me when 3 people where ready to fil me in. He called me like a minute before I received the first text from a girl saying al my boyfriend told her. 

I forgave him pretty quickly.  I love him and want to make our family work. 

So yeah I think I am kind off the asshole for sl@@ping him. But do I deserve  the cold shoulder  and al the negativity he is throwing at me ?"
xcpu4u_2441,xcpu4u,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"For context I have been with my partner for 2 years and recently we decided to take a break to reassess the relationship as he is..well immature on the best of days. He does not work full time and proposed to me with the notiom that he would just marry me to get medical coverage, so he could stay home and game all day. For context hes an avid gamer, however very very immature (controller throwing, wall punching, ect) when playing.

Fool me once on that one, i know. So we decided to take a break, given that we would come back after he reevaluates himself, and i reevaluate me and my life/goals. Well the more time i spend away from him the more i realize I really enjoy being without him.

I feel as though I am ready to just let him go, but I also feel like that maybe an AH thing to do, just because I got a taste of freedom away from him.

If more context is needed feel free to ask, my brain is just fried right now processing."
xcvzrv_2447,xcvzrv,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for maybe 5 months now. To paint an accurate picture of the situation I have to admit that we have a huge age gap, but that’s not really the focus of this post. He’s 61 and I recently turned 20. So anyways, I’ve been seeing him for a while and we’ve become very close, I sleep at his house almost every night and we spend a lot of time together. I’m an emotional person and I tend to develop feelings quickly so I eventually asked him if he considered me to be his gf and he said no, that’s not a good idea because our age gap is too big for any serious commitment between us. This kind of rubbed me the wrong way because he had told me about exes he had before with a very similar age gap so I don’t understand why it’s so different with me, but I just let it go and continued enjoying being with him.
About 3 days ago I texted him asking if I could come over, fully expecting a yes because I come over all the time. He took a long time to respond and when he did he claimed he was having dinner with a friend so he wasn’t home yet. I said no problem, I’ll just wait for you at your place until you get back. Again, this is normal for us to do when he’s at work late or something and I come over and wait for him so we can go to bed together. He told me that he wasn’t going to be home until maybe midnight and he didn’t want to rush things so it would be better if I didn’t come over that night. This whole time he’s responding so slow when he usually texts me back right away. I got suspicious and asked if the “friend” was his ex and he admitted that it was. I was mad and left the conversation there.
About two days later he texts me asking if I’m mad at him. I accused him of sleeping with her and he got offended by that. I also brought up the fact that he’s not even willing to claim me as his gf but he was willing to do that with her when they were together. He called me insecure and I basically threatened to sleep with someone else. I might have overreacted but in my defense, I feel like anyone would be mad about that. AITA?"
xdhfm5_2452,xdhfm5,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Am I the A-hole for Trying to Change Classes with a Teacher who has Allergies

So School has just started again and It was all going fine, my last teacher exclaimed that her helper (HT for Helper Teacher( had a deathly allergy against any perfume or fragrance and that she had ADHD  which we were all fine with, she started yelling at kids for muttering because of her adhd and used that as an excuse to yell at them.

The next time we had her class, my friend (F for Friend) had applied deodorant and perfume two hours prior to going to her class, F had forgot that she had this class so when she entered the room, She first asked me if she smelled like perfume, I told her no, then she went up to the main teacher (MT) and asked if it was okay, next thing we know HT walked into the room, walked by F, overheard her and instantly started acting like she was dying while very loudly going ""No It's too strong!"" 

Excuse me if I'm wrong but don't Allergic reactions take a minute to actually get bad, like you don't just eat a peanut and instantly puff up.
HT started acting like she was having an instant anxiety attack, saying her chest was closing up and that she had to leave

MT told F to go sit back while they figure out what to do, HT started saying she had a headache and started grabbing all her things which took her a good minute.

(I forgot to mention both me and my friend are overweight and I have always had issues with body oder to the point we've considered taking me to the doctor for it. )

Class was continuing all normal, some kids kept staring at us and the two boys that sat in front of us started repeating ""Why did you spray it."" Even after F would say why, which brought more attention to us


But HT walked back in the classroom in about 5 minutes after she left and went across the room grabbed more stuff and left.

I wish I was kidding..
I really do..
We continued doing our work and HT walked BACK in AGAIN, it was almost the end of the period and went ""No I can't-""

She didn't come back in for the rest of the day but I did email the Guidance to try and talk about this topic and how I  have gym and I already get made fun of enough and that I don't want to add smelling bad to the reasons.

I eventually got onto the bus and with a heavy sigh I went ""I can't handle HT"" and a girl who I'll call T, she was in our class and she asked why

I told her why and she started yelling at me saying I was disrespecting the teacher and that I was messed up.
I have already spoken with the Guidance and she said she will try to get me out of that class and that HT has brought attention negatively to MULTIPLE students

I didn't even spray anything! That was (No offense) My friends doing!


Edit: The Student on the bus, T has started telling everyone on my bus about it and everytime I get on the bus I get weird stares. I just want the whole thing to be over with for both me and the teachers sake, I think people are missing the reason I posted this, she was using her disability to yell and mistreat people, I myself have disabilities is certain ways so I am not trying to just hate on her for having disabilities too

I avoided her today because I was near someone with perfume on and I didn't want her to have an allergic reaction

If your going to insult me. Don't comment. I'm here for genuine help on how to better myself

 I(22f) have been with my bf (22m) for 4 years. Yesterday i was at launch with my bf, bff and bff's bf. The topic of abortion came along and me, my bff and her bf said that abortion laws are bs but my bf said he agrees with them because it's killing a baby. He said that of a woman doesn't want babs she should use protection. I told him that birth control and condoms are 100% effective and his response was ""then they shouldn't have sex"". I did not want to cause a scene in public so i didn't say anything. When we got home he proceeded to try and get me to have sex with him but i said no because i don't want kids. We had a huge fight and i left. He told his parents and they told my parents and now all are blowing up my phone calling me an AH for refusing to sleep with him. I explained the situation and they said that I'm still an AH and it's not fair because in our stat they're still legal. My bf texted apologizing for his comment and he said he realized it was very disrespectful. Idk. It's not the first time he said something sexist/misogynistic/offensive about women and apologized to get what he wants. Idk if i believe he's actually sorry. Fells like he's only saying it so i would come home and have sex with him. So idk. AITAH ?

UPDATE!
I called him and a girl answered the phone. When my bf well ex now, came to the phone he said ""i wasn't going to wait for you to come to your senses and move your bitchy ass back home. I wanted sex, i got it."". And then proceeded to apologize because it was just sex and meant nothing to him. So yeah. I guess I'm single now...."

We go see our favorite artists the ones we honestly went for and that was really cool I was in a mosh pit for the first time which was not fun as the artists are $B. We went back to the hotel and started to drink I got really drunk and blacked out we had been dating for 4 months at this point and it was just not working out and I'm a really honest drunk. I re downloaded tinder and said and I quote ""I can't fuck the same person for the rest of my life"" she was pissed and looking back it was a dick move but I honestly didn't think it was that bad. We come back home and decide to split ways. I pull into my house and my car just stops working cost over 1k to fix.  I go over to her house like a month later and I'm devastated. Just broken like using shit I hadn't touched in awhile drinking hella, drunk driving such stupid shit just no regard for my mental or physical well-being. We talk and it's just the same shit it was all my fault and I'm the bad guy. I could never see from her perspective. She hadn't gotten the bill for her CC yet and asked me if I could pay her by the end of July I said sure. A week goes by and I'm just at my lowest point contemplating suicide or a purposeful overdose or a DBC.

She gets pissy and tells me to give her all her shit back ( a few pieces of clothes and some smoking shit) and pay her back. I told her I'd give the stuff back but I wasn't paying the money cause I paid 1k to fix my car when I came back. She's still pissed and even had this dude from her work call me and try to threaten me. Am I the asshole

Right on if you read this lm still really tryna get over this bullshit I can post a more detailed version of our relationship but she was very manipulative and if she wasn't winning argument I just didn't agree she just start crying and then like that would always entice me to be like oh I'm sorry it's my fault

I 27f and 33m husband have been married for 8yrs and have a 7yr old daughter. My husband will be having a knee surgery in a month or so due to a work injury and has been sitting at home for almost 3 months now. I have been a sahm on and off since my daughter was born. My husband has always worked but has quit multiple jobs and has been injured multiple times causing major financial issues for these 7yrs. He refuses to help do anything around the house 99% of the time. The only time he does do anything is if i make him. Doesnt care to do anything with our daughter unless I make him. He spend all his time not at work playing video games. I've been talking with him about divorce for yrs now. Since I don't have a career it will be hard for me to start over on my own. I haven't been able to stay at jobs long because he has always worked crazy hours to where I have to be home to get our daughter on and off the bus. I can't even depend on him to keep our bills paid because he's always quitting jobs before he has a new one or getting hurt on the job. We just had to sell my truck because he's on workers comp and we couldn't afford both car payments. I do everything but go to a job. I take care of the house, cook, clean, childcare, doctor appointments, paying the bills, grocery shopping, all the yard work, take care of our dogs, shovel the snow in the winter, laundry and I'm tired of it. I constantly have to clean up after him. He leaves garbage everywhere and his clothes down stairs. We have a laundry room upstairs.

xdt0xb_2494,xdt0xb,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I feel like this needs a lot of background information so sorry I’m advance if this is really long. 
I (19F) am having issues with my family. 
BACKSTORY: When I was younger my Dad and Mom were both using meth so my childhood was never great. My parents fought all the time and even got physical a few times. I got whipped with a belt more times then I can count and often had red marks or, was in so much pain I had to ask my sister to check my a** to see if I was okay. Fast forward to around 12y/o my parents got a divorce and I stayed with my dad and my sister with my mom. I don’t remember a lot from this time except that I ended up moving in with my mom to be closer to my sister. Well my mom went to jail so my sister and I were sent to our dads. About a month or two later my mom got out of jail and my dad ended up getting clean around a year and a half later. The relationship with my mom never got better as she was still using and she passed when I was 17. 

My dad throughout this time was never perfect he has a lot of anger issues he would take out on my sister and I and in general has always made us feel like we can’t talk to him about our feelings without getting yelled at or told that we’re basically overreacting and that’s why I’m having such a hard time now with what I’m going through. 

My whole life I have stepped on eggshells around my dad just to please him or not piss him off in fear of getting yelled at or him just not understanding my emotions and telling me there invalid. 

Now that I’m older and more aware of what I went through/how I’ve been treated I want to forgive him but it’s hard. He doesn’t put in much of an effort to see me or visit me now that I’ve moved out and it was to the point I would cook dinner just so he would come over and stay a while. 

Here’s where I need advice… I told my dad that ever since he got a new girlfriend I feel forgotten about / left out. He said he understands why but that it’s a two way street and I need to make an effort to. My issue is I’ve spent my whole life trying to please him and make an effort I’m just tired and ready for him to take some responsibility. 

I want to tell him it shouldn’t have to be a two way street because as a parent I feel it’s his responsibility to have a relationship with his kids and to be in our lives. I don’t feel I should have to make an effort in order for him to make one to. So basically AITA for feeling like my dad should make an effort without the condition that I do the same? I feel like he should make an effort no matter what to be in my life because he’s the parent. Am I wrong? 

Edit: Since people seem confused on this I do try super hard to be in his life. From cooking dinner to notes in his house on a white board or the many encouraging messages I’ve left him about overcoming his addiction and how proud I am of him. I do try it’s just the more I do the more he expects of me and for once I just want some love in return. Or even for him to just be proud of me. 
Also I’m not mad he’s in a new relationship. He deserves to be loved as much as anyone else. Ando can tell he’s very happy with her. I just think it should be a priority for him to introduce us to the new woman in his life and make sure we get along.

Edit: UPDATE 1

I tried to tell him exactly how I felt today but we just went around in circles. I feel like he glossed over all the points I made and didn’t really give me much of a response. 

He was also not willing to take responsibility for my childhood which as a parent I feel it was his responsibility to protect me and he didn’t and that is 100% his fault and 100% my moms as well however the only one who’s here to fix it is him. I know that sucks for him because it’s hard to admit when you fuck up. But he fucked up big time and trying to push away the responsibility is not going to mend the relationship only make it worse. 

I know I’m 19 now and relationships goes both ways but I can’t focus on the future until the past is fixed. I’ve realized this goes deeper then just needing him in my life. I need him to help me mend what he broke and take responsibility for the pain he’s put me through. Because without that I don’t think I can more forward with him. 

Ik it’s not fair of me to live in the past but I can’t take him into my future without fixing or at least trying to fix the past. And if he’s not willing to help me then I don’t know how I can forgive him. After going around in circles all day I finally told him we need a mediator because we’re getting no where going about it the way we have. I’m trying so hard to fix this relationship and still feel like I’m getting no where?

Tomorrow we will sit down with a mediator and discuss. I will update after that if anyone is still interested

I’m sorry to everyone for all the edits I’ve made. I need to say this tho. A lot of you have suggested therapy and while I agree I clearly need it. I can not afford it right now my boyfriend and I are barely making ends meet as is. Others have suggested I try to do other things that cost money such as cooking or going out with my dad to bond but that requires money I do not have right now. Since COVID hit and prices keep rising we just can’t get back into a good financial situation.

Final update: this conversation went better then the last. We had a mediator and I don’t feel like we went around in circles. We both apologized for wrong doings and came to the agreement that we’re not always going to agree on everything. He can’t fix the past but he can work for better in the future. I can’t hold my childhood against him if I expect anything to get better. Apparently my insurance covers therapy so I will be working through my childhood trauma in therapy. He said I’ve opened his eyes and he apologized more times then I feel he ever has in my life. So moving forward I will be demanding respect. Because if he wants to treat me like a child or like he still has power over me this won’t work and we both agreed on that. For once I feel like we made progress and I’m happy with where we left things."
xdt0xb_2496,xdt0xb,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I feel like this needs a lot of background information so sorry I’m advance if this is really long. 
I (19F) am having issues with my family. 
BACKSTORY: When I was younger my Dad and Mom were both using meth so my childhood was never great. My parents fought all the time and even got physical a few times. I got whipped with a belt more times then I can count and often had red marks or, was in so much pain I had to ask my sister to check my a** to see if I was okay. Fast forward to around 12y/o my parents got a divorce and I stayed with my dad and my sister with my mom. I don’t remember a lot from this time except that I ended up moving in with my mom to be closer to my sister. Well my mom went to jail so my sister and I were sent to our dads. About a month or two later my mom got out of jail and my dad ended up getting clean around a year and a half later. The relationship with my mom never got better as she was still using and she passed when I was 17. 

My dad throughout this time was never perfect he has a lot of anger issues he would take out on my sister and I and in general has always made us feel like we can’t talk to him about our feelings without getting yelled at or told that we’re basically overreacting and that’s why I’m having such a hard time now with what I’m going through. 

My whole life I have stepped on eggshells around my dad just to please him or not piss him off in fear of getting yelled at or him just not understanding my emotions and telling me there invalid. 

Now that I’m older and more aware of what I went through/how I’ve been treated I want to forgive him but it’s hard. He doesn’t put in much of an effort to see me or visit me now that I’ve moved out and it was to the point I would cook dinner just so he would come over and stay a while.

We use to let them stay over a lot and have time with them. Well the last time we did so, we made sure to pack everything they needed as usual and even told them we could bring extra of whatever they needed so just ask. My 2 year old comes home sick and the next day can't sit on his behind at all. I call and ask every question of what happened to my son. They got offended that I asked if he got into their weed as it was out where he could get to it. They call and text me saying I'm f***ing stupid for thinking they would let him have any and that I'm not a good mother. Am I the a-hole for standing up to them, telling them that I am a mother and should be allowed to ask what caused the issue my son was having?"

xejlr0_2522,xejlr0,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (22M) have been in a relationship with my gf (20F) for just over a year now. We come from very different backgrounds. She is from a really rough neighbourhood with a very high crime rate, and I am from a really safe neighbourhood with very little crime.

Within the first few months of our relationship, my gf got into a confrontation with another girl and it turned physical. I immediately jumped in between them, broke them apart, and dragged my gf out of there. As soon as we got in the car to leave though, my gf started going off at me, telling me ""that's not how we do things here"" and insisting that if a fight starts I need to just let it happen like everyone else in her social circle apparently does. She told me how I embarrassed her in front of everyone for breaking up the fight, and how that made it look like she couldn't handle herself, like she needed her man to protect her, and that everyone would now think the other girl would have beaten her if I didn't step in.

I apologised and explained that, since I'm not from the same kind of neighbourhood, I didn't understand the etiquette of such things. I told her that if that's what she wants then from now on I promise I'll never step in or break up any fights she gets into. She said ""good, you better not!"" I still wanted to be sure I understood exactly what she wanted though, so I asked some follow up questions for confirmation.

I asked her if the rule still applied if she got double teamed, and she said that if another girl or guy joined in to help her opponent, then I could do the same for her, but that I had to actually fight too, not just break it up.

I asked her what about if she got into a fight with a guy rather than a girl, and she said that if it was one on one then the same rule applies and that I just have to let it happen and not jump in to help or break it up.

I asked her what about if she got into a fight with a girl or guy who was much bigger than her, and again she said the same rule applies and that I'm not to jump in at all.

Finally I asked what about if her opponent started beating her and hurting her really badly. My gf laughed and said that would never happen, but that even if it did the same rule applies and I'm not to jump in to help or break it up no matter what.

So less than a month later, a similar situation occurs. My gf gets into a confrontation with another girl (a bit bigger than her), it turns physical, and this time I don't step in. My gf beats the other girl soundly, and after the fight she praises me and thanks me for sticking to my promise and not breaking it up.

Cut to a few months later then and another similar situation occurs. My gf and her girls get into a confrontation with another crew of girls, my gf calls out the mouthiest one (who is a little smaller than my gf) and they start throwing hands while the rest of us watch. Within 10 seconds, it's obvious the mouthy girl is getting the better of my gf, so I think about stepping in, but I remember what my gf made me promise, so I don't. The mouthy girl ends up basically kicking my gf's ass for a minute or so, dropping her with a right hook, and then forcing her to admit she's beaten.

When my gf gets up, she tells me we're leaving, so we immediately get in the car and head home. I try to comfort her but she keeps telling me not to talk to her and that she doesn't want to talk.

For the next few weeks, she is depressed, barely talks, won't leave the house, and doesn't want to see any of her girls. Finally, after weeks of this, she randomly asks me why I didn't break up the fight. I tell her she made me promise not to and she says ""well now I can't even show my face around any of those people again."" I try to talk about it more but she insists she doesn't want to talk or think about it ever again.

She's still very depressed now, and I can't help but think I should have stepped in as soon as the mouthy girl started getting the better of her. I know my gf made me promise not to, but I still feel like the AH now.

AITAH?

Edit 1: So dozens of responses have said some variation of ""growing up in a rough neighbourhood doesn't justify/excuse your gf from getting into so many fights."" Yes, I know. I never said it did, nor did I even imply it did. The only reason I mentioned my gf's upbringing was for context, so readers would understand how it contrasted with my own, thus allowing them to understand why my gf would feel like it made sense to tell me ""that's not how we do things here"". If I hadn't mentioned our different upbringings, so much of the story (particularly my gf's statements to me) wouldn't have made sense. I didn't say it to try to justify or excuse her behaviour.

Edit 2: To everyone telling me I should break up with my gf, and that she isn't wife material, I get it. I have been second guessing aspects of the relationship pretty much since day one and I am fully aware of all the potential problems down the track if she keeps up her violent behaviour. We do get along so well apart from this one issue though, and she does have a lot of great qualities about her as well. She is fiercely loyal, funny, generous, and would 100% put herself on the line without a second's thought to defend me if I needed her to. Unfortunately, with these AITAH posts, readers only get to see the one asshole-ish aspect of a person, not the full picture. But yes, I do see the problems with the relationship.         "

Met my ex boyfriend, got along great. He met my daughter, things got serious, we moved in together. His family lives like two states over, so he was planning a trip to see them and was asking me to come along so they could meet me and my daughter (4 years old).

&amp;#x200B;

 Problem is - a year or so ago, his stepdad was charged with indecent images of children on his computer. He got served his sentence (community service) and probation. Was a whole family drama about it as the court case went on for like, two years. He obviously denies it and his whole family stand behind him and apparently its a thing where these files of children get sent around the world with some sort of VPN thing (I'm not great with computers) so they can't be traced to who is actually wanting them.   
He pled guilty because they apparently scared him with a ""if you're guilty and say you're not guilty, you'll get &lt;insert jail time&gt;"" 

 I understand my then boyfriend and his entire family saw him as a victim and he swore that he wasn't like that. But he's known him most his life, I haven't even met the man and it's not worth the risk. Even if I agreed, we'd have to inform the cops and CPS and they'd be wondering why I'm letting my daughter around a convicted sex offender. 

It's just not worth it, too many risks. We got into a huge argument and ended up breaking up over it. 

Honestly, I'm not beat up about it - daughter comes first 100%. But he said i'm the biggest A-hole going and considering he told me that when he first met his stepdad when he was like 10, the first thing he did was turn orange peel into a man with a penis...I'm just not seeing what they see."

I am really nice to everyone and I have a really hard time saying no (due to past trauma and I think people will get mad if I say no). I moved out when I was 21 and have been in my own place since November 2021. My mom moved in next door to me because she had just left my stepdad and she got a job and supported herself for the first time ever. My issue is she took in my half sister and her boyfriend and now she’s saying she can’t afford to raise them by herself. So I helped out with groceries and I was broke all of the time(I’ve been broke before I don’t mind it). Then she asked for help on her rent, then for gas until finally I got behind on my rent because I was trying to help her. And then she started telling my older brother to ask me for money when he needed help and I didn’t feel like I could say no. I don’t want to just cut her off but I just started college and I don’t really have the money to give her. I just don’t know how to dig myself out of this hole and I don’t want her to hate me. So Reddit AITA if I cut her off? (And if anyone has advice on what to do I’m open to anything)


Edit: my half sister is 15 and she moved in with our mom when something happened with her dad. And her boyfriend is 17 he was homeless so he was spending the night and my mom let him stay indefinitely. I am going to try to take your advice I’m just not sure exactly how I’m going to do it. She’s so far behind on rent our landlord has considered kicking her out. I didn’t get that far behind but I’ve been working overtime for two months to try to get back on track. Y’all are helping me understand that this isn’t okay and I really appreciate it. Even the tough love comments are helping me see clearly. Thank you guys for your advice and comments."

Give me any instrument and I could learn it in a week. I’m in percussion, and I’m the most advanced in my section (yes I’m bragging smd), so since it’s early on in the year we have new people in our sections. So before I get into that I need to explain how my school is. So we don’t have a middle school, so as soon as you hit 7th you’re sent to the high school. So in 7th grade our school requires you either do band, or choir, so there are usually a lot of new 7th graders who join percussion, because some of the instruments are really easy, and it’s better than singing and dancing, and we usually do give them the easier parts, because I get it, and also hate school choir.

Anyways now getting into the actual story, so I’m going to start off the story by saying I’m gay. I highly prefer women, and the only men I am attracted to are like men from TV shows. I’ve honestly never been attracted to a man I know irl before. So this is the first year this one 7th grader has done band, and he has absolutely no musical experience, so he was off the bat horrible. Our band teacher just kinda left it up to anyone in our section who’s more experienced, so I was one of the students helping him. So this whole thing mostly started by us all going over accents. He didn't know how hard to hit the drum, or how to hit it, for some of the accents, so I just did what my band teacher did, and I just grabbed onto his hand and played the accents so he could get the feel. The next morning a girl in his class who's also in band, came up to me and told me about how his girlfriend is mad about me being ""too touchy"". I just thought it was funny because I am a fruit, and a 12 year old thinks I want her boyfriend. 

So the weeks move on, and this 12 year old still is talking about me. Our section is pretty cramped, so to get where I need to go, I sometimes gently move people out of the way. There was a certain situation she was upset about. So her boyfriend was in my way, so I pushed his shoulder to move him, but for some reason he thought it'd be cute to just not move anyway. Now I ain't got the time for this shit yk, so I put my hand on his chest, and slammed him into a wall. I guess from her perspective it looked sexual or something? I just ignored it again, until at the end of the period, this 5'1 little girl, approaches me AND CALLS ME A WHORE AND A BITCH?!?!? Tf… Now I am 14 and I am a proud ass virgin mf. Now I've kissed 20+ girls🥶 but that does not make me a whore.

So I could have just told her I am gay, BUT AFTER THAT BS? Nah I'm gonna fuck with her. So now anytime he needs help I purposefully hold his hand, even if not 100% necessary. I'll purposefully forget some of my music, so I have to sit right next to him. And heres where I may have gone too far… 

I like physical touch, so if I'm next to one of my closer friends, I'll hold their hand, or like lean on them or something. So today he asked me ""If your gay, why do you always hold hands with guys?"" I told him, and he asked if he could hold my hand. IK IM SORRY THIS IS THE MOST IMMATURE SHIT EVER BUT I HELD THAT MF HAND. Once she realized her face got red asf, than she started whispering to her friends. And that would of 100% been the end of it, IF I DIDNT HEAR THAT LITTLE BITCH CALL ME A WHORE AGAIN. So when we were reviewing shit I leaned my head on him, than a few minutes later pulled out the ""Im cold🥺"" card and wore that 12 year olds flannel like a champ. All of my friends thought this was hilarious, but I started to feel bad when I saw her tear up. 

So should I just grow up, stop fucking with a 7th graders love life, and tell her Ima f@g? AITAH?"

The worst part about it is that nobody wants to hear a kid rant about how much school sucks. Most of the time I just hear sick it up or deal with it. 

So I decided to tell my mom about all of my problems with school. About all of the bullying, teasing, and otherwise anything else I hate about it in the car. Then out of nowhere she snapped talking about how I need to stop complaining and focus on grades. And proceeds to give me a very long lecture. 

When it was all over she told me that my grades better be good and didn’t talk to me until next morning. I thought all adults were supposed to listen to kids who need help not ignore them. AITA"
xh5ewh_2593,xh5ewh,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I know this sounds very rude but hear me out. I (f 18) have started working since I was 17 my cousin (f 22) has two kids a 2 year old boy and a 4 year old girl. It was Friday night and I was working a double shift from 10:30 am till 10:30 at night. My cousin had called me during a rush hour (9:30 pm) and had ask me to babysit her kids all night for her to go out and party with her husband. I told her I’d have to see when I get out and depends if I’m tired by the end of my shift.  Without a warning she had dropped the kids off at my mother’s house while I’m still at work and left as fast as possible. Now since I live with my grandmother (f 67) and mother (f 39), my mother had called me during work 30 minutes later asking me if I said yes to babysitting, my response was, “No I didn’t say yes, I told her I would see when I get out and depends if I’m tired”. Now by this time it was around 10 and I started feeling really tired now that my adrenaline passed. My cousin started spamming my phone with calls 5 minutes later, after missing her calls about 6 times I checked my phone and saw the messages she left me. She had told me “So. Now you not going to pick up thanks for putting me in this situation.” I had left her on read ignoring her due to her dropping off the kids without my knowledge. 10 minutes later she had texted me saying “Wow thanks a lot.” I had completely ignored her again. Once I got off my shift and went home I was already pissed due to my last few minutes of my shift. I went to my room and immediately threw my bag on my bed then went to my grandmothers room to see the kids in her room playing with their toys on the floor. I talked to my grandmother asking what my cousin had told her. Her words were “She told me you said you’d babysit the kids all night till tomorrow” I was visible angry and told her “I haven’t said anything like that and the kids are not staying the night” I walked out her room and went to my mother’s room to talk to her and she was angry as well talking with her fiancé. She had told me she had just gotten off the phone with my cousin and my cousin was talking crap saying she’d curse me out. With my mother coming to my defense she obviously wouldn’t let that happen. Now from the monitor in my mothers room I see my cousin quickly running past the dining room up the stairs and came into my moms room where I was. She immediately started yelling asking “didn’t you say you were gonna babysit the kids?! Why do I have to pick them up?!” With my anxiety kicking in from her yelling I stated “my words were that I’d see when I get out and it depends if I’m tired.” Now to my family it looked like I haven’t slept in days but i had some makeup covering that the best possible. My cousin had told me “No you said yes when you get out of work” and I immediately said no repeatedly. Then she yelled saying “Are you going to sit here calling me a lair?!” I just looked at my mom for help since I was on the verge of crying at this point. My mother told her that my cousin should’ve called her first since it was her house. While they argued back and forth I was trying to get myself calm so I can try to explain my words better. Towards the end I yelled at her saying “The kids are no longer allowed here and you can leave!” All because I heard my cousin cursing my mother out. My cousin had grabbed one of her kids (m 2 yrs) and accidentally slammed his head on the wall when grabbing him. She quickly left after yelling at me, my mother, and my grandmother. The next day I woke up to an audio message from her saying thanks to me she has no babysitter for her kids and telling me to have a good life. I’m still shocked by everything that happened as I’m writing this the next day.

I know they have been friends for almost all their lives, she was with him when divorced his ex, when his daughter was born and etc. 

But she treats him like he is her property, when we go out, she appears from nowhere, she calls him at the worst times, refers to him as her bby, uses all kind of cute nicknames for him, interrups me when I am talking about anything and tries to correct me, and you know all those little petty things she can do to attract his attention her way.

He started talking about I move in with him,  an engagement, and about making a family with me, I'm child free, and he Knows and respect that, apparently she knows too, for some comments she has made. 

I try to be polite and respectful, but I can not in good conscience move to his house, because he can not put limits for her, most of the time I feel uncomfortable and seriously think she is attacking me, and he does not tell her anything, sometimes he even agrees with her.

So, I talked to him, and did tell him that he needs to start putting limits, because I feel insecure and don't want to pass time around her, she is with us almost every minute we spend together, he even put her in our chat (there are not private conversations) and he said I was over reacting.

Anyway she called me and said  I was a jealous c... and that I'm trying to destroy their friendship, I finally decided to give him an ultimatum, put her in her place and give mine or we are done, he said that he can not terminate the friendship (I did not ask him to) his and hers friends are calling me an a-hole for making him choose (again that is not what I wanted) and I seriously doubt this relationship will survive this.

ETA: 

This is the 5th day without contact, boyfriend or Ex, has not call me and I don't know what to think, has not changed pictures or status in social media, so to friends and family we are still in a relationship (oddly normal for him)

His daughter gave me a call yesterday, said Gelica (fake name) has been in the house all this time, she cooks, clean and well for some miracle she is not sleeping there, she said his father keeps saying this is my fault, that I'm a manipulative, toxic and controling person (said the narcissist) 

It is al very clear now, is in it? They are almost like a married couple, and I have no doubt he has been cheating on me whit her.

Went to the doctor, made exams, all clean in that front thank goodness.

I have not tried to call him, but I will because I need all the stuff I left in his house and obviously I don't intend to let them use me as a punching bag, and well I work hard for my things, so I do not intend for her to use my clothes, shoes, makeup or my e-reader (the most important one) 

I'll update if or when something happens.

Ohh and he is upset because I changed all my streaming acounts, and he can't see his series any more, his daughter said he made a masive tantrum because of it."

Ohh and he is upset because I changed all my streaming acounts, and he can't see his series any more, his daughter said he made a masive tantrum because of it."
xhf5g2_2607,xhf5g2,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"A few years ago my dad and stepmom moved to a different state to take care of family and asked me if I would like to take over their house until they come back. Me, my husband my brother and nephew took over the house and the mortgage payment, but she refused to let us pay it through our bank account because she wanted to ""make sure it was being paid"". We confirmed that the money we sent her as ""rent"" would be for the mortgage only. 
 It soon became apparent that they weren't coming back, but they said we could stay in their house. Fast forward about 12 months and stepmom tells us we need to buy the house or leave so she can sell it. The house was going into foreclosure because they had not been paying the mortgage with our money, but paying for their bills and her hobbies. Step mom doesn't work. Even when my dad lost his job she refused to get one. Dad losing his job was her excuse for taking the money in the first place, but they continued to use it for 8 months after he got a new one.

My husband, brother, nephew and I were all staying here because we had little choice. I was a struggling adult college student, my brother just escaped from an abusive wife with his son and we were sticking together because we each couldn't afford to live on our own. She offered this house as a ""kindness"" to ""help us out"".

 When we found out what she did we were obviously upset. How could she take our money and use it instead of paying the mortgage! Now we're facing homelessness! She knew the house would immedetly go into foreclosure because they had been grossly behind before and were on a deal as it was, stipulation being that they don't miss anymore payments.
She didn't apologize. She decided that because it was her house she could do whatever she wanted with the ""rent money"". Even though that meant we could be kicked out on the street at any moment.

She believes she has done nothing wrong, that there is no law that ""tenants rent"" has to go to the mortgage. She's right. Technically she didn't commit a crime. However If we had known she was going to use the money for anything else we never would have moved in and she knew it. 

In my eyes she lied, went back on her word, stole from, used and manipulated us for over a year. She risked homelessness for 2 of her kids and her 7yr old grandson.

Her behavior is a pattern. None of my other siblings speak to her anymore for various toxic patterns she has. Now I am going no contact as well. This woman does not care about me, and my dad let it happen, he doesn't care either. She believes I am being dramatic and selfish. AITAH??"

AITA for wanting to cut all ties to my child? Backstory, I’ve always tried to be there for my child, but I had her young and screwed up. She was raised by my parents but I was always involved. Despite turning my life around, creating a family with my husband and other kids, she has never wanted to live with us because we have rules and expectations. There are consequences and everyone is expected to contribute to the household chores, neither of which she liked. I’ve always helped financially where I can, paid child support when I was working, bought extras, helped with haircuts, dentists etc as a parent should. I’ve always paid for her cell phone as well. A few years ago, my daughter ended up a pregnant teenager. My parents told her she couldn’t continue to live with them if she didn’t have an abortion so she came to live with me. We spent thousands of dollars to Reno the house to make room for the baby. During COVID, she wanted to go out to a bunch of friends houses and we told her no as some of us have pre existing health concerns and didn’t need to add COVID on top of them. She decided we were too strict and moved in with her then boyfriend and his family because it’s not fair she shouldn’t get to live her life and she shouldn’t have to follow our rules. She moved back in with us, and completely flaked on her child. I ended up raising the baby for over a year with very little help. Again, we completely redid the new house to ensure the baby had a safe, warm place to live, financially supported our grandchild and went in serious debt to make this happen. All the while, my daughter was accusing my husband of being heavy handed, hot tempered and an ass. My parents ended up living with us at the new house and to say the least, it didn’t end well. No one cooked, no one cleaned, all financial bills (including groceries) fell to my husband and I, who both work. My mental health took a nosedive (I’m receiving virtual therapy to cope with this). I ended up asking my parents to leave and even still gave my daughter the option to stay. She decided to leave (as expected honestly). Now comes the part where in a way I think I may be the AH here. Over the last little bit, we have been forbidden from seeing our grandchild. We’ve been disinvited to graduation (she wants her bio dad who walked out of her life 15 years ago to go so we aren’t allowed to go) husband is still being accused of being a heavy handed hot tempered AH (CPS has been involved many times as this has been happening for 10+ years and nothing comes of it as it’s simply not true. The last time, we were actually told the daughter wasn’t allowed to reside in our home as they are tired of her false stories and we still let her come back) my other kids have been outcast, I nearly lost my job (i work with kids), my husband has had to switch jobs to accommodate taking on the role of helping to raise the grandchild and our lives have just been toxic hell for over a year now. The only thing keeping me still financially supporting my daughter was the grandchild, without that, AITA for completely cutting her off? For finally washing my hands of all the toxicity? I just feel like since I’m a nobody, then my money should go to my own household and not hers?

Update for those who asked. Shit blew up. Like BLEW UP!!! The last week ish, things haven’t been going well for her. She’s been reaching out and asking for help. I have provided as much help as I possibly can. Today, I received a very concerning call that resulted in police help to remove her from the situation. She has apologized and told me she understands why I have been the way I’ve been. Why things have transpired they way they have. She realizes that for a long time, I haven’t been the issue and it’s taken her to go thru the last few months to have her eyes opened as to the person/parent she doesn’t want to grow into. She is with me until she is ready and able to move out on her own and yes, she is required to pay some expenses (her personal expenses like phone, insurance etc, am not asking for rent/groceries outside anything special she wants to eat as my rule has always been if my kids are going to school, they will pay personal expenses and I will cover the rest if they are under my roof). Moving forward she has a lot to figure out, a lot of her plate and some tough choices that require big girl panties but I am confident she can get thru it. Also yes, she will be getting any and all mental health help, counselling etc that is needed to help her understand and work on herself so she can be the parent and role model her child deserves. Also, I may have seen my grand baby today and cried till I was outta breath. Yes they are both safe and all that matters to me is that. The rest can be dealt with after a few days of decompressing"

xisb8b_2642,xisb8b,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (17F) and my two sisters R (14F) and A (21F) have not had the best childhood. I have similar trauma with A and R. We grew up with my moms alcoholic and abusive boyfriend (call him G), he would constantly belittle us and we had quite a few incidents of him getting very physically with us and our mom. It took 5 years for my mom to kick him out. R however never had any known physical incidents with him. Last time we saw him before he left our home was when i was in the 6-8th grade.

Him and my mom had 2 babies together. After G moved out he ended up passing away and my mom got a new boyfriend, who is his brother (call him D). D doesnt act like G whatsoever. The only issue me and my sisters had at first were that they looked identical, so it was constant anxiousness at first but we warmed up soon.

A became G. She would constantly beat on me, belittle me and much more. It wasnt a sibling rivalry, she would body slam me, kick me, punch me, and everytime i had to visit the hospital my mom always told me to lie and say i had fallen off the trampoline or something similar.

In 6-7th grade (i dont know when cause its all kind of foggy memory but it was when G had just left and D was new to the home)) my dad had a wife. His wife has a son (call him J and he was around 16 or 17, same age as A). My father and his wife had 2 more kids together. When me and R would go over we noticed J would like to “tickle” us as a “joke. He would always tickle our sides and legs, but as time went on we noticed how high his hands would get higher and tried our best efforts to shove him off of us out of discomfort. Soon it had reached the point where he would try to touch the bottom of our butts and we, as 13 and under children, didn’t know what was happening. One night he had snuck into our rooms very late at night and did some things (r word) to both me and R. During this time A had stopped visiting because she got in trouble for being caught smoking weed. It took us around a year to come out about it but we had gotten no justice for ourselves.

After coming out about J, i was constantly visiting school counselor. Telling her about how i was doing and even had told her about an attempt i had made to off myself. A, like her abusive self, did not like that. She did not like the attention i got from it and she had beat me over it and would yell at me even more. She would laugh at me how i faked an attempt and how i should try for real. She destroyed me mentally and i dont think i could ever forgive her for what she did to me.

The whole problem started to happen when J had admitted to what he had done to me and R along with trying to off himself (which failed). He was being charged for multiple things but me and R decide to wait to press charges (still waiting). Our family heard about the news and my favorite aunt had come to me and asked how i was and if i was doing alright. 

Around 3 months before J admitted, A had moved back in with our mom after living with her boyfriend 6 hours away. A had paid no attention to J admitting the first few days which made me happy simply because i didnt want to talk about it, nor did R. The whole situation had hurt me and R so bad that we now have a fear of men.

Another thing to note, ever since A had moved back in, she had been non stop on how shes always having panic attacks and is so traumatized. When she would talk to me about our childhood she had talked about it like we hadnt been through the same thing and as if i do not have mental illnesses due to our past. “Well atleast mom acted like a mom to you” “You dont know what i had been through” is what she would say. By the way, I’m a middle child. I was a constant babysitter and even had to make food for everyone in the house. I was a constant maid for the family and despite all my efforts to help out everyone, i was belittled by G and even my mom with “you never do anything in the house”. A had also become a crazy dog person, claiming how she loved dogs so much but when she caught our family dog in her dogs bowl eating she put her in the cage, tilted it back slightly so she was trapped at the back, stuck her foot inside and kicked her multiple times. When our dog looked at her dog in a weird way she would grab a cup of water and dump it on her then throw her outside in freezing temperatures. D never let this stand and even shouted at her a few times (he was not the type to yell but her straight up abusing this dog was more important then him trying to have a civil talk). When D would shout at her and call her out for what she was doing, she would shout back for a bit and then randomly start crying and playing victim. I understand that she had a tough childhood and i also get ptsd attacks from shouting, but crying about being called out for abusing a dog when u were fine at first and even shouted back for 20 minutes? Thats just stupid. There were many times where D would stand between her and the dog but A would claim a panic attack and my mom took her side.

We had many heated fights. Some of them would range from her trying her best to get into my room and to me, by sticking a body part in between the door and refusing to remove it by saying “you’re crushing me”. One time a fight like that did happen and she ended up destroying my bird cage cause she was kicking inside the room. The cage had fallen and was inches from crushing my birds. After that fight she put on shorts and played victim by pointing to a faded red mark on her leg and saying “look at what she did to me” while i was stood in my room, puffy eyes, with bird bedding, seeds and water everywhere while my birds just got done calming themselves down.

That fight was the worse but the one that made me say “no one cares about your trauma” pissed me off more. The day was going fine and I decided i wanted to mess with my sisters rollerblades. I put them on and went around but when i went into the kitchen my sister was sat at the table, rolling weed. She saw me and freaked out because her dog heard the blades rolling and started barking. She told me to take them off because she doesnt want her dog freaking out. I simply told her to shut her door or deal with it because i dont care. We exchanged a few words before she randomly brought up my offing attempt and said something about me faking it (which i didnt and am doing better mentally now). I got pissed and told her to shut up but she kept pushing me, talking about how i copied her trauma and J never did anything to me despite him ADMITTING it. She said a bit more before i straight up screamed that no one cares about her trauma and how unlike her i know how to keep it in the past to not hurt anyone else (she brings up G constantly and makes our two youngest sisters sad by saying shit like “he was a horrible dad” or “you two are lucky u didnt have to meet him” because they were super young when he left and died). She looked at me for a moment before picking up her phone. She called my mom and started crying, telling my mom what i said and how i said it unprovoked. Thankfully i was recording a video of my rollerblading for fun and had caught our interaction. I showed my mom and my mom told us to stop acting like children and get over ourselves. I was pissed the rest of the night but brushed it off. She ended up not talking to me for a few weeks but AITAH?"

A had paid no attention to J admitting the first few days which made me happy simply because i didnt want to talk about it, nor did R. The whole situation had hurt me and R so bad that we now have a fear of men.

Another thing to note, ever since A had moved back in, she had been non stop on how shes always having panic attacks and is so traumatized. When she would talk to me about our childhood she had talked about it like we hadnt been through the same thing and as if i do not have mental illnesses due to our past. “Well atleast mom acted like a mom to you” “You dont know what i had been through” is what she would say. By the way, I’m a middle child. I was a constant babysitter and even had to make food for everyone in the house. I was a constant maid for the family and despite all my efforts to help out everyone, i was belittled by G and even my mom with “you never do anything in the house”. A had also become a crazy dog person, claiming how she loved dogs so much but when she caught our family dog in her dogs bowl eating she put her in the cage, tilted it back slightly so she was trapped at the back, stuck her foot inside and kicked her multiple times. When our dog looked at her dog in a weird way she would grab a cup of water and dump it on her then throw her outside in freezing temperatures. D never let this stand and even shouted at her a few times (he was not the type to yell but her straight up abusing this dog was more important then him trying to have a civil talk). When D would shout at her and call her out for what she was doing, she would shout back for a bit and then randomly start crying and playing victim. I understand that she had a tough childhood and i also get ptsd attacks from shouting, but crying about being called out for abusing a dog when u were fine at first and even shouted back for 20 minutes? Thats just stupid. There were many times where D would stand between her and the dog but A would claim a panic attack and my mom took her side.

We had many heated fights. Some of them would range from her trying her best to get into my room and to me, by sticking a body part in between the door and refusing to remove it by saying “you’re crushing me”. One time a fight like that did happen and she ended up destroying my bird cage cause she was kicking inside the room. The cage had fallen and was inches from crushing my birds. After that fight she put on shorts and played victim by pointing to a faded red mark on her leg and saying “look at what she did to me” while i was stood in my room, puffy eyes, with bird bedding, seeds and water everywhere while my birds just got done calming themselves down.

That fight was the worse but the one that made me say “no one cares about your trauma” pissed me off more. The day was going fine and I decided i wanted to mess with my sisters rollerblades. I put them on and went around but when i went into the kitchen my sister was sat at the table, rolling weed. She saw me and freaked out because her dog heard the blades rolling and started barking. She told me to take them off because she doesnt want her dog freaking out. I simply told her to shut her door or deal with it because i dont care. We exchanged a few words before she randomly brought up my offing attempt and said something about me faking it (which i didnt and am doing better mentally now). I got pissed and told her to shut up but she kept pushing me, talking about how i copied her trauma and J never did anything to me despite him ADMITTING it. She said a bit more before i straight up screamed that no one cares about her trauma and how unlike her i know how to keep it in the past to not hurt anyone else (she brings up G constantly and makes our two youngest sisters sad by saying shit like “he was a horrible dad” or “you two are lucky u didnt have to meet him” because they were super young when he left and died). She looked at me for a moment before picking up her phone. She called my mom and started crying, telling my mom what i said and how i said it unprovoked. Thankfully i was recording a video of my rollerblading for fun and had caught our interaction. I showed my mom and my mom told us to stop acting like children and get over ourselves. I was pissed the rest of the night but brushed it off. She ended up not talking to me for a few weeks but AITAH?"

Our friend (husband) is a nice person, but his wife has a very bad attitude and their son's behavior is always so mean. We meet them in common friend's lunch / dinner parties and have invited them to our home very very few times. Since husband is a good friend to us, we had to invite him and his family to lunch as this is the last one we are hosting in this home.

Husband could not join us, as he was travelling with his co-workers for fun.  Wife came with their 10 years old son.

Friend's son was all over the place. He literally went to every single room, opened each and every drawer, shelf etc.  I was not comfortable and I told his mother about this. She asked me to leave him alone, and also told me that he is an explorer and he never touch anything which he is not supposed to. All of our friends are well aware that in our home Study, Master bed and Master bath are off-limits. (In our friends circle every home/ family has few areas off-limit, some areas for everybody, some areas for kids and we all respect that)

After a while he went inside our master bedroom, went through all our personal stuffs in our master bedroom, closet and bath, I did not notice that he went inside. He came to me with few stuffs in his hands (two small decoration piece that we keep on the side table, and a sleep body wash) and then he started questioning why we have these decorations in our bedroom, and also  why there are so many pictures in the room and why there are so many dresses, jackets , shoes , handbags in the closet, why i had to have body wash specially for sleep etc.,  This was in front of atleast 70% of  the guests who came over, rest of them were scattered.

I took his mother little far from the crowd and told her that I'm not comfortable letting anyone in our personal areas, and our guests are always welcome to stay / access common areas (living, dining, bathrooms, kitchen and backyard), and everyone in our friends circle knew about this. She was not ready to even listen what I had to say. She created a big scene and made a comment about how I was so rude to her kid, also I can never be around kids,  because I did not have one.

At this point I got so angry. I was so close to throwing her and her son out. But, my husband spoke to me, asking not to get furious or do any thing that is going be uncomfortable to everyone around. So we have decided to finish off the party without creating a drama and not to stay in touch with her any more.

After all these, she is telling our friends that I was so rude to her kid and I am ill-mannered. So, People should stay away from me. Some of our friends, who could not come over to our lunch,  happen to know about this through our other friends who were there. Few of them even told  us that my behavior was not wrong and she should stop bitching about us. Also some told if its not for her husband we would not even keep her in the circle.

So, my dear redditters i would like to know AITAH for not allowing anyone in our bedroom? Also, AITAH for disconnecting her friendship?

Edit #1 (22 Hours after the initial post) : 

My husband had a conversation with his friend, he apologized for whatever has happend. He also stated that he is trying hard to discipline his son, but with his wife's pampering he is not able to do that. 

My husband and I have decided not to have any contacts with them (both husband and wife) any more. Initially we thought we can just block wife alone from our life. But she has access to her husband's phone, basically access to all his accounts/ contacts.  There is no point just cutting ties off with one person. 

So, here we are. Out from a toxic association, so called friendship.

I (30f) am married to my husband (34m) and his sister (33f) is married to bil (35m). 
I live in a small town on a farm  that my husband and I manage. My
  Some back story, my bil and sil live with my mil and have 3 daughters (&gt;1,8&amp;13)
They pay no rent and my husband and I are helping my mil out significantly financially to offset the extra cost of them living there. They are constantly breaking things and using the children as an excuse ie.” we will just move and never let you see them again” so my mil begs them to stay and the cycle restarts. 
  My husband and I are financially stable. Our farm is profitable and we both work decent jobs. He makes around 120k a year and I make 80k working from home. My grandfather left me a substantial inheritance and I paid off all of our debt and have set up college funds for our sons (7&amp;10) and my nieces.
  We work hard and don’t mind supporting mil at all, she has been a mother to me as my relationship with my own mother is rocky. I was raised by my grandparents who have both passed away. 


  Now to the headline. A few days ago, I went to visit my nieces and to cook breakfast for them. While talking to the oldest, she tells me her daddy has been trying to teach her she needs to be a good wife someday and obedient to her husband. I laughed and told her she didn’t have to do anything she didn’t want to. I will always support them. Bil heard me and got mad. He said how could a broke woman know how to do anything without her husband telling her it’s ok? 
I told him to repeat that. He usually is silent when I’m there so I was taken aback a bit. 
  He then said “my husband makes the money and I gave him sons and know how to keep house. That’s your job nothing more “
  I told him I make plenty of money myself, I own more than half of our farm, and I have been keeping a roof over his family’s head for years and to stfu.
  My husband hears me getting upset and comes inside to see what’s wrong. 

My bil tells him to muzzle his dog before he does. 

Now my husband is 6’5” 250
My bil is 5’6” maybe 140 soaking wet. 
 My husband dares him to say it again but I intervened stopping the fight before it started, I didn’t want the kids to see anything bad or harmful. 

  The rest of the morning was awkward and my bil spent it making remarkes about me being broke and my husband having to pay for me.  After eating, I hear him begging his wife to co-sign on a truck he really wanted in town. I listened but don’t care enough to hear the details. I just know she said no and he got mad. 
  Later I was helping my mil learn how to pay a bill online and he left the build/buy page for a chevy truck open on the computer. After being a little nosey, I noticed that he found the truck he was wanting. A 2022 LTZ chevy 3500. 

Now my husband and I have been talking about upgrading my truck just didn’t know what color I wanted. So I was feeling petty and messaged the dealership. 
   I spoke to my husband and he thought it was fine, we need a new one anyway. 

When I arrive. They have the EXACT build my bil was wanting. Down to the tires.  I liked it to. So I paid cash for it shook their hands and drove off. 

Later that day I needed to drop off my kids off with mil, so my husband and I could go on a date. When we pull in my bils jaw drops and he starts walking around the truck complementing my husband on a great choice and how much he wanted one, just couldn’t get financing yet but he had the money to put down now. 
My husband told him it’s not his truck, it was mine. Bil laughed and said now come on I know it may be hers but you paid for it.  My husband said no. She paid for it. Bil then asked me what my payments are and I said I don’t have a payment. 
 He didn’t believe me so I showed him the bill of sale and my receipt from the dealership. 

  This made him angry and he went inside and locked his and sils bedroom door behind him. 
     The next day, he called to tell us that we own him a truck since I clearly stole that one out from under him he even text a “bill” for his pain and suffering wanting us to pay for his truck. 
He said since we were already paying some of the bills we can just add this too. I said absolutely not and left it at that. 

Not a few mutual friends and some family members are saying I am the asshole for buying the truck he wanted and making him feel small when I showed him how much I paid for it. His mom is also saying I should just pay for it since I am well off and her son isn’t. 
My husband is on my side but wants to keep the peace. So am I the asshole, should I apologize?

Update: 

Bil became violent towards sil over their daughters. Not going to go into much detail but he was arrested. 
Sil decided she’s had enough and is divorcing him. I’m paying for an attorney as the bank account they have, he is the only one with access and she doesn’t work. Mil cried, she is relieved and even said she is glad her son married someone who cares for others and cares for them. 

Sil started an application for self help housing, where they can build a home for themselves and she put in applications for good jobs and she finally feels free. 

Bil will be charged with dv and sa so he will have no contact with them and wasn’t offered bail. 

Thank you all so much! Will update if anything major changes."

My sister and I have had a lot of ups and downs but lately the baby has brought us closer. Rob has two kids (20f and 21f) They live with their mom. They both were out of the country until the day I arrived at music festivals.  I’ve never met either of them though I’m sure they’re nice. Im diagnosed OCD which i feel like is key here. I have to be in control when I can. Im working on it. As a first time mom, I am a germaphobe. I only wanted to visit my family and very close friends while on the trip. 

Deb and Rob wanted the girls to meet my baby. I said NO because of RSV, Covid and a million other germs. Not to mention they were complete strangers to me..They pressed and I said “NO! it’s not happening.” Deb screamed at me and kicked me out of their house, leaving me stranded with nowhere to go. My baby and I had to wait in the rain, and he was so scared by her yelling he was crying. Luckily my mom picked me up and I quickly changed my flight and left the next day. I haven’t talked to Deb since, and plan on never talking to her again tbh. She is so selfish. 

Now this is the part where i might be the ass.. About a month after I left, Rob got into a serious accident and had to go to the ER. On top of his injuries, a major issue was found on his CT scan. He is now facing serious surgery. 

I haven’t reached out to my sister. I don’t plan to. Even though my mom and other siblings say I should and just let bygones be bygones.. But i can’t get over that she kicked me and my infant son because i didn’t want to subject my son to strangers/her adult stepchildren’s germs.

xjvbp9_2676,xjvbp9,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"I’m divorcing my wife

For this post we will call her T 

T and I met on tinder, and right before Covid went on a lovely date then chatted the next few months through quarantine. Eventually she got bored so we started hanging out despite Covid quarantine rules. One thing lead to another and we were dating. 6 months in things were great but we were both students, myself at a local school in the US and with her doing school remote for a prestigious school in Ecuador. 

She was here on a visa which was due to expire, because of Covid she had a 6 month extension as Ecuador wasn’t accepting anyone into the country but at the end of that time she would have to return to Ecuador or we find another way for her to stay (I.E Marriage, baby or visa). 

We both had love for each other but everything felt rushed, I told her I wasn’t ready for marriage and that she (23) was to young and I’m not ready as well (28). She had already used all of her visas and a baby was out of the question. She basically said if there’s no future between then we need to end things now (8 months in) so I promised we would have a future. 

Long story short we got engaged at Christmas (1 year) and wed in February, we hurried so T could file for a green card and be able use her degree to get a better job. I paid a lawyer 6 grand to file the papers. (First you get a work permit, then after interviews it’s a green card if the marriage based application is approved) 

She moved in with me and my parents while I finished school and transitioned into a new career we also spent 2 months doing the paper world for the immigration process . We were stuck for awhile and I was not the best husband for the first year of our marriage. It was weird with my parents around and I wasn’t ready for all this mayhem. I should’ve been better but I made some mistakes, never cheated but got mad and said stupid stuff here and there. I admit my mistakes but I changed them and became a better person and tried to be the best husband I could. 

I had a funny feeling one night and asked for her phone combo since I thought it was weird I didn’t have it as her husband. Until that post I had complete trust in her but She was so against it I knew something was up.

After a year She eventually got her work permit from the government and was able to get a good job and we used her proof income to secure us our place own place in 2 months. My income sucked as my business was just starting. A little while later I started having some success in my new field and thought things were going to get better between us. 

We went on a trip to Vegas for a wedding I was still suspicious without that phone code and I saw her snapping a guy while she didn’t see me. She never used snap before and I knew what it meant as I saw the whole conversation while sitting outside looking through a window. I didn’t say a word to her the entire trip I just ordered a GPS tracker and had it installed the night we got back home without telling her. 

The next day she drove to a random apartment after work, I knew she would be going somewhere so I arrived 10 mins after her and told her to come outside. She came out I told her unlock the phone and she did, It took all of 3 mins to find a picture of her kissing another man. Took some screenshots of that and their messages, confronted her about but she didn’t say much. 

She later said it wasn’t anything serious… she never cheated whatever… I never believed it because I saw the messages but because I didn’t want to ruin her life and I did love her so I decided to try. 

In the end I tried to forgive her and move on with our life’s as we were getting our own place and After a lot of talking with both sets of parents I took her back and we got moved into our own place. One week into it and I caught her hanging out with him again. She swore it was to say goodbye and it was at a bar so I eventually let it slide. As the parents pointed out a divorce now would end her immigration process and ability to work effectively ruining her life and wasting 6k I spent for her lawyer. I stupidly still loved her and tried to down play it. 

She tried to love me again but the damage was done, my birthday came and went and despite an awesome party and two expensive gifts, we still hadn’t had sex in two months. The chemistry was gone completely. I still had love for her but it was turning into anger and hatred rather quickly as I never felt she was truly trying to make the marriage work. 

We tried with counseling for two more months to save the marriage but things had gotten physical in all the wrong ways. We went out with friends came back drunk and She broke my $1000 work phone and in response I broke her phone and called her a bunch of horrible things I’m not proud of. 

She slapped me, strangled me, hit me, kicked me and threatened me with a knife. This was the 5th episode like that during our 3 year relationship. I’ve never laid a finger on her, but I have said some mean stuff that I apologized for. 

I wanted a wife, not an Amber heard. 
I told her I was done, that we would divorce and go our separate ways, immigration be damned. She was okay with it at first until she realized she would lose everything (job, legal status, ability to stay and work in us)

Now she wants me to not divorce her but just separate and be legally married but still be free to see others. We would then proceed with and immigration interview where she would get her green card. That goes against every fiber of my being. This relationship is toxic and I want out as fast as possible. Am I the Asshole for wanting her to lose her future In the US and likely sent back to Ecuador, where there is no jobs and lots of violence? She wants me to give her 5 months of separation but still legally married (and financially responsible) but still be free to see other people and lie to immigration. 


Note: she will lose the ability to work if we divorce, as well as have 30 days to leave the country or be here illegally making her unemployed. Our marriage started out legitimately and we have not committed any fraud crimes. 

She loses everything 30 days after I file, I don’t care I want her gone. I speak with my attorney in two days to find out my best move. 

For clarification, the marriage started legitimately. A divorce/annulment/ ending of marriage legally means her visa becomes invalid along with her work permit.

For this post we will call her T 

T and I met on tinder, and right before Covid went on a lovely date then chatted the next few months through quarantine. Eventually she got bored so we started hanging out despite Covid quarantine rules. One thing lead to another and we were dating. 6 months in things were great but we were both students, myself at a local school in the US and with her doing school remote for a prestigious school in Ecuador. 

She was here on a visa which was due to expire, because of Covid she had a 6 month extension as Ecuador wasn’t accepting anyone into the country but at the end of that time she would have to return to Ecuador or we find another way for her to stay (I.E Marriage, baby or visa). 

We both had love for each other but everything felt rushed, I told her I wasn’t ready for marriage and that she (23) was to young and I’m not ready as well (28). She had already used all of her visas and a baby was out of the question. She basically said if there’s no future between then we need to end things now (8 months in) so I promised we would have a future. 

Long story short we got engaged at Christmas (1 year) and wed in February, we hurried so T could file for a green card and be able use her degree to get a better job. I paid a lawyer 6 grand to file the papers. (First you get a work permit, then after interviews it’s a green card if the marriage based application is approved) 

She moved in with me and my parents while I finished school and transitioned into a new career we also spent 2 months doing the paper world for the immigration process . We were stuck for awhile and I was not the best husband for the first year of our marriage. It was weird with my parents around and I wasn’t ready for all this mayhem. I should’ve been better but I made some mistakes, never cheated but got mad and said stupid stuff here and there. I admit my mistakes but I changed them and became a better person and tried to be the best husband I could. 

I had a funny feeling one night and asked for her phone combo since I thought it was weird I didn’t have it as her husband. Until that post I had complete trust in her but She was so against it I knew something was up.

After a year She eventually got her work permit from the government and was able to get a good job and we used her proof income to secure us our place own place in 2 months. My income sucked as my business was just starting. A little while later I started having some success in my new field and thought things were going to get better between us. 

We went on a trip to Vegas for a wedding I was still suspicious without that phone code and I saw her snapping a guy while she didn’t see me. She never used snap before and I knew what it meant as I saw the whole conversation while sitting outside looking through a window. I didn’t say a word to her the entire trip I just ordered a GPS tracker and had it installed the night we got back home without telling her. 

The next day she drove to a random apartment after work, I knew she would be going somewhere so I arrived 10 mins after her and told her to come outside. She came out I told her unlock the phone and she did, It took all of 3 mins to find a picture of her kissing another man. Took some screenshots of that and their messages, confronted her about but she didn’t say much. 

She later said it wasn’t anything serious… she never cheated whatever… I never believed it because I saw the messages but because I didn’t want to ruin her life and I did love her so I decided to try. 

In the end I tried to forgive her and move on with our life’s as we were getting our own place and After a lot of talking with both sets of parents I took her back and we got moved into our own place. One week into it and I caught her hanging out with him again. She swore it was to say goodbye and it was at a bar so I eventually let it slide. As the parents pointed out a divorce now would end her immigration process and ability to work effectively ruining her life and wasting 6k I spent for her lawyer. I stupidly still loved her and tried to down play it. 

She tried to love me again but the damage was done, my birthday came and went and despite an awesome party and two expensive gifts, we still hadn’t had sex in two months. The chemistry was gone completely. I still had love for her but it was turning into anger and hatred rather quickly as I never felt she was truly trying to make the marriage work.

xks5h1_2696,xks5h1,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"I’m not even sure where to begin. My (23F) brother (24m) is mentally challenged. My mom (53f) never wanted to get him fully diagnosed due to reason I’m not too sure of. He basically has the mind of a 10 year old however he is still a functioning person despite that. My mom spoiled him rotten, he doesn’t have to do anything besides sit in bed and get up to go to the bathroom. My moms entire world revolves around my brother, she does everything for him. In spite of this everything he could do to make my life miserable he did; breaking toys, punching, spitting, hair pulling, chocking, kicking, pulling knives. Just about anything that that made me happy sent him into a full blown meltdown. He always had anger issues but I was always smaller than him so he took them out on me. For instance, when I was a kid and I would play this littlest pet shop game on the computer and he hated it. He would come into the room and check and see if I was playing. If I was he would punch me five times and leave, if he came back and I was still playing he would do it again and add five more, making sure to count so he didn’t miss one. This would continue for hours on in. You may be wondering; Where are my parents during all this? They are in the living room hearing my cry’s and yelling at me for upsetting him and “setting him off”. In their mind since he “didn’t know any better” I was always at fault, he heard them say that so much he started saying it himself after doing something awful to me. No matter how much he would hurt me they’d spin it all around and I would be in trouble. I couldn’t feel joy or happiness without him coming right around and abusing me for it followed by my parents berating me for “causing it all in the first place” I’m still dealing with the left over trauma to this day and struggle with mental illness as well.  I resent my brother so much due him stealing my childhood from me. I try to look at him as a brother but it’s very hard for me to. All I see is the pain he has caused me. My mom had mentioned a couple of times while I was growing up that when they passed It would be my responsibility to take care of my brother. Of course I refused and it always resulted in a long argument that sometimes lasted for days. If it isn’t obvious my relationship with my parents isn’t the best. My mom tried her hardest but she was disabled with really bad COPD and various other respiratory issues. She also is bipolar and Unmedicated. My dad (64m) is a very bitter man. The only thing he truly cares about is gambling and alcohol. He would get drunk, gamble all his money away and come home and fight with everyone all day; even going as far to threaten to hurt and even kill my mom, brother, and I. He was worse than my brother, I still try not to talk to him to this day. Anyway, not long after I turned 18 my dad kicked me out and I’ve been on my own since with little contact. Over the pass year or two I’ve started talking to my mom more. We still butt heads but I’m grateful I finally get to have a semi normal relationship with her. In the past two months my mom has found out she has cancer. We’re not certain on the stage yet but she is in poor health and is also refusing chemotherapy. Recently she has brought up the question of me taking my brother in if she passes again. I told her I wasn’t budging on the matter. She told me once again it’s my responsibility as his sister to take care of him knowing how my father is and it’s the least I can do after she raised me and him for so many years. I ended the call not too long after to avoid the argument from escalating further but I know my mom isn’t happy about it. My brother’s temper has gotten a bit better with age however, caring for him is a full time job. While he is able to care for himself to an extent he’s never had to and basically refuses. I currently work full time as a manager at a retail store and am in a relationship with a man I want to marry and one day have kids with. We can’t just drop everything and take care of him for the rest of our lives. I’ve also spent years repairing the mental damage he has done to me and fear him being around will just tear it all apart. I feel awful because I know my dad is a terrible person, with his alcoholism and my mom no longer being there to break up any fights that erupt it could end badly. But I don’t think I could physically handle doing it. I feel selfish. So Reddit, AITA?



TLDR; AITA for refusing to take full time care of my mentally challenged brother who abused me my entire childhood if my mom dies from cancer. Leaving him with my alcoholic abusive dad


Edit: I replied this to a comment but I decided to just go ahead and put it in the post to hopefully answer some questions. When my mom originally told me she had cancer she brought up she didn’t know what would happened with him if she passes (I’m assuming she was hoping for me to offer to take him). I started talking to her about teaching him some life skills so he’ll be better equipped for it such as cooking, cleaning, ect. But she stated that he doesn’t want that and would much rather someone else just care for him since that is what he’s use to. I’ve also brought up long term care facilities as well but she says she doesn’t feel comfortable letting strangers care for her baby and that she’d much prefer for him to stay with family because “that’s what family does for each other”. We have a rather large family on my moms side so I’ve asked before why none of them could take him and she just said she couldn’t expect her brothers and sisters to care for her child when she has another child who is normal, as she would say, and who is well off enough financially to provide him with a comfortable life (which is not the case. Inflation is kicking our ass rn). I’m also going to add that my mom has admitted at multiple points growing up that part of the reason they choose to have a second child was so my brother would have someone to live with once they were gone. This has been a plan they’ve had in place since before I was even born. I’ve also not spoken with her since she had brought it up due to me just trying to process it all. On top of everything I’ve been strictly NC with my dad and she’s also trying to make me “make amends” with him since he’s “family” so this whole ordeal what been really wearing down on me mentally."

I was upset that I would have to drive over 525 miles to a town I did not know by myself because my boyfriend could not attend and that my girls where not welcomed but he would be allowing another child that is not family attend.

He has this friend (16f almost 17) who he helps around. (They’ve known each other longer than he’s known me and I’m absolutely okay with them being friends.) She has some situations that aren’t so great which left her living alone. She goes to school and has a job but never saves her money. She always has to make sure her nails and hair and clothes are up to this worlds standards which is fine but shouldn’t be her main priority. At first things started off fine, he’d give her rides to and from school and work just to make sure she kept up on those things. After a while she started getting comfortable asking him for rides other places. He of course said yes just to be a nice guy. He’d help take things to her mothers house and take her mother places as well. One time I decided to come with them just so I could hang out with him and her. I’ve met her before and she seemed like a nice person so I figured it would be okay. When we went to pick her up she was instantly upset because it was 30 minutes later than when he said he would come get her so I guess it was reasonable but she instantly blamed it on me. He helped load all the stuff she needed into his car(which was quite a bit.) She had an attitude the entire time and exclaimed how she wanted to sit in the front. As his gf I didn’t want to give up my seat but he asked me to just for the sake of not being yelled at by her and I agreed. Everything was okay other than the occasional comment towards me as we drove 30 minutes to where her mother was.  When we got there they unloaded all the stuff she had brought with her. I thought that we would just bring her home after but instead her mother asked if we could take her to the store. I didn’t really say much but while driving the girls mother talked about how her daughter should be a better person and how she shouldn’t be so rude to me. She said that she didn’t raise her daughter that way and that she taught her to be friendly towards someone even if she didn’t want to be friends just because you never know what someone else is going through. Instantly the girl shot back and started going off on me and shouting vulgar words towards me. She said how she didn’t care about anyone anyone but herself and that she is the only person she needs. I bit my tongue trying to stay calm. After the store I finally thought that we would be on our way back to the girls home but then her mother asked for another ride somewhere. At this point a ride that was supposed to take an hour was reaching the 2 hour mark and I was feeling more frustrated. We drove another 20 minutes to a sketchy building where the mom got out and said she’d be right back in a couple mins. We sat in the car waiting listening to my bfs music. The girl got more irritated and said she didn’t want to listen to his music because she wanted to listen to hers. We continued to listen to his anyway for about 5 more mins when she turned the music off. He switched it back on, but she turned it back off again saying “you cant listen to a rap song in an area like this with the name Oprah in the lyrics.” Then she took out her bowl and started smoking. I’m okay with people smoking around me as most of my friends do it but one thing you guys should know is that my bf was born with a condition where his trachea was closed, he can’t breathe well and being around smoke makes it a risk for him being able to breathe and gives him headaches. She didn’t even care and said how she lives her life as she wants to. After she rolled her window down and said how she wanted to listen for her mother anyway so the music should stay off. We waited for 30 mins in silence after she decided to call her mother to ask when she’d be out. Her mom said she’d be right there which ended up being another ten mins. Finally the mom gets back in the car and we take her back. After their goodbyes, we finally take the girl back. While driving she talks about how she’s always been there for my bf through other relationships and how I’m not different from anyone else. As we left and I got into the front again, the girl kept looking at me and that’s when I completely lost it. The whole ride back to my bfs I went off on how she uses him for rides and doesn’t appreciate him and how he needs to stop letting her control him. I asked him not to do it anymore, he said that he agrees and that he’d stop giving her rides because he’s tired of her attitude and thinking she can get away with using him. It’s been about a week and he texted me tonight saying how he’s going to go give her a ride to her mothers and that we can hangout after. I told him don’t bother hanging out with me because I already know it’s going to be later than he says and how I can’t believe he’s going to give her rides still after everything that’s happened and with how she treats him. So, AITA?"
xlgkvw_2719,xlgkvw,top-comment,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"I (18f) know how it sounds but just listen. My bf (20m) and I have been dating for a little bit and have known each other for a while. He has this friend (16f almost 17) who he helps around. (They’ve known each other longer than he’s known me and I’m absolutely okay with them being friends.) She has some situations that aren’t so great which left her living alone. She goes to school and has a job but never saves her money. She always has to make sure her nails and hair and clothes are up to this worlds standards which is fine but shouldn’t be her main priority. At first things started off fine, he’d give her rides to and from school and work just to make sure she kept up on those things. After a while she started getting comfortable asking him for rides other places. He of course said yes just to be a nice guy. He’d help take things to her mothers house and take her mother places as well. One time I decided to come with them just so I could hang out with him and her. I’ve met her before and she seemed like a nice person so I figured it would be okay. When we went to pick her up she was instantly upset because it was 30 minutes later than when he said he would come get her so I guess it was reasonable but she instantly blamed it on me. He helped load all the stuff she needed into his car(which was quite a bit.) She had an attitude the entire time and exclaimed how she wanted to sit in the front. As his gf I didn’t want to give up my seat but he asked me to just for the sake of not being yelled at by her and I agreed. Everything was okay other than the occasional comment towards me as we drove 30 minutes to where her mother was.  When we got there they unloaded all the stuff she had brought with her. I thought that we would just bring her home after but instead her mother asked if we could take her to the store. I didn’t really say much but while driving the girls mother talked about how her daughter should be a better person and how she shouldn’t be so rude to me. She said that she didn’t raise her daughter that way and that she taught her to be friendly towards someone even if she didn’t want to be friends just because you never know what someone else is going through.

She has dementia and doesn't remember any of us which is hard to see and be around, but I came on the trip to see her so that if she passes in the next 2 years before there is even a possibility of another visit I won't feel the guilt of not having even tried to see her ..
Anyways my bf (M27) and I have lived together for a little over a year. We have texted and talked every day, but the first day I talked to him he said something that really hurt my feelings. He mentioned how he's getting a vacation and the whole house to himself and essentially how nice it is. I may be blowing it out of proportion but I have BPD and it is sometimes hard to distinguish what is and isn't malicious I guess for lack of a better term. Over the course of the week he has used this joke multiple times and it upsets me more and more each time, which I have expressed to him in the moment. I called him a bunch tonight because I'm not doing well and just wanted to hear him say it's all going to be ok.. maybe a little too dependent but I can't go to my mom she'll react in a way the whole situation will blow out of proportion. He answered the phone and immediately blew up on me about how it's late and I can't call him right now. Im already crying and feeling so alone and I don't understand why he has to yell at me. It frustrated him I know.. I'm the kind of person when I get a call from someone I haven't talked to in a long time or I get a call in the middle of the night I will answer and immediately ask if the other person is ok. He knows that, he's been around when I've gotten calls and I always answer the same way. ""Hey bud are you ok?""
Anyways he yelled at me and hung up so I texted him about how he's being an asshole yelling at his crying girlfriend. About how he doesn't seem to want me around seeing as he's having such a great time without me there and that this whole week has been his own personal vacation away from me. I on the other hand miss him very much. Apparently he was ""making a joke"" about being on vacation and I'm taking it the wrong way.. I've told him i didn't think it was funny! He told me that it's not really a vacation that he does miss me very much and is lonely without me. We ended the conversation with I love you and goodnight to each other, but now I feel crazy and like and asshole for feeling the way I do. Feeling like he meant that he doesn't like having me around and that I'm such a nuisance it's like a vacation to have me gone. I'm aware they're BPD thoughts but it's sometimes hard to control. Especially if I've been told multiple times. Idk.. AITAH?"

xm8al1_2746,xm8al1,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"My husband and I are both shy and introverted and don’t like big ceremonies.

A few years ago when discussions our future together, we both realized that neither of us wanted a wedding ceremony. We both hate being in the spotlight. However, both of our families are very traditional and would not recognize our marriage if we didn’t have a ceremony.


So my husband and I signed our papers and quietly got married. We decided to host a wedding of sorts so that our families would be appeased and accept our relationship. We decided we’d throw a wedding but just not attend (we instead found strangers who looked like us online and paid them to go as us to the wedding).


We had a “glow in the dark” wedding theme (which my parents tolerated but weren’t too happy about because they’re against themed weddings). My husband and I arranged for there to be a bunch of black lights but then tampered with most of them so that they wouldn’t work and lighting would be minimal (almost pitch black) so that our families wouldn’t be able to see and thus would be none the wiser to the fact that my husband and I weren’t actually there. We also said that we weren’t feeling well and had come down with a cold as an excuse to ask everyone to keep their distance from our look alikes.


Unfortunately, apparently my mother in law got too close and realized it wasn’t actually my husband and caused a scene and ruined things by telling everyone else.

So AITA for throwing an untraditional wedding being upset at my MIL for disrupting it? My family has been blowing up my phone calling me an ahole for being dishonest but I feel like I wouldn’t have to have done this in the 1st place if my family would just recognize my wedding without a ceremony."

I (27f) lives with my husband (30m)

I worked with my aunt ( let’s call her Betty) for 4 years. 
She had worked in the sector I was in. She worked there for around 20 years, she was never my boss ( important for later) 

Betty was extremely hard on me ( but no one else) as we worked in the same department, I could of made a genuine error ( we are humans everyone makes small mistakes) however she used to shout/embarrass me in front of colleagues to the point I used to either cry or just quietly for the rest of the shift normal shifts are 8 hours but can be 12.5 -14 hours If someone calls in sick. 

If she made the same error, yet again a small error and we ( 8 in our team) joked on that she made the mistake such as “ come on Betty you’ve been here 20 years you should know better” 
However she used it take it out on me by saying “ we can make mistakes OP were human” which is contradictory to what she tells us blah blah blah. Yet again not our boss. 

I was being bullied by another coworker to the point I was crying in bathroom at work crying to parents when I went to visit them. 
I rang our department and Betty answered asked to speak to boss ( as well as mother did) betty point  blank shouted no numerous times ( our calls are recorded inbound and out bound) so I was still bullied and made to feel isolated by said bully. 

She used to not be happy when people called in sick. I had to go to A&amp;E ( emergency room) due to suspected blood poisoning she wasn’t happy that parent took me to get a dress to cheer me up. ( I could of had blood poisoning for crying out loud!)
Someone’s dog passed away she wasn’t pleased baring in mind Betty has no kids or pets. 

However she went off poorly  and we weren’t bothered if you’re sick you’re sick 
 Betty told us We weren’t allowed to even leave house if we were off sick she made it known she wasn’t happy. Yet again not our boss 
When she went off sick She went abroad and everyone was not pleased as she had it drilled into our heads that we weren’t allowed to leave the house if were sick. Or even go food shopping etc. I even cleared it with my boss I could leave the house as i was terrified to get wring off Betty 


I had to take long term sick leave due to severe illness ( husband paid my bills for the whole year I was off which I’m entirely grateful for.) No he is not on the deeds if property and we have a prenup in place re my money cars house
Betty alsotold me my back injury was all in my head ( bad car accident in 2017 3 car pile up) found out I have 3 crumbling disks in spine and 2 in my neck. No apologises from Betty about saying rude things.  


Betty was making it her business to find out where I was if I wasn’t at work ringing her boss colleagues etc they couldn’t disclose where I was so she was ringing parents ( my mother is her sister) 

She pretty much broke into my house once it confront be about a sillly rumour at work. 
She didn’t ask me the gentle adult way she just plainly accused me of making an OF ( if I did nothing to do with her I didn’t have one) 
I screamed at her to leave my property and I said she would be arrested for trespassing.
My husband came running downstairs as fast as he could ti see what the commotion was. 
He even told her to leave 

I have not spoken to her since she has been pretty much talking about me to my mother. 
She severely disrespected me and she knows it! I haven’t spoken to her since February time and even though she knows she’s done it she’s too stuck up to apologise. My mother is desperate for us to speak again however I refuse to unless she apologises

xnjhka_2795,xnjhka,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (15f) have been away for 5 days in London with my dad as my mum and sister went away as my sister has been dealing with a break up. My boyfriend (15m) is weird when I go away because he doesn’t like when I’m away from him and he has been weird with me all week when we talk because I wasn’t there with him. He got a chest infection while I was away and because he has asthma he really suffered and he kept saying to me why did u go away, I really needed you and basically making me feel guilty until we had an argument but that’s for a different story. He was doing this thing where whenever I said I missed him he would say ‘sure’ and overall just being weird. Once u got home earlier I brought the dogs inside and got my bags in and said hi to my mum that’s it and that was over the course of 5 minutes, I looked at my phone and saw a message from my boyfriend and it said ‘would of been nice if u told me you was home’ I told him I had only been home 5 minutes and he went off saying it takes 15 seconds to send a message and it didn’t and it proves how much I think and consider him. I got really confused of why he was so angry and he kept saying that I could of messaged him even before I pulled up to the house and now he is saying he won’t come and see me. 
I feel like he is being really overbearing and he has always been like this, he is possessive and has to know everything, I don’t think I did anything wrong but I want to make sure, AITAH?"
xnqjoe_2801,xnqjoe,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1," I 27 female, and my husband 29 male, have been married for three years. Last year I was pregnant with his son and so was another woman that he had an affair with. (Yes she knew we were married) When I found out our relationship soon became edgy and I almost left him, but somehow we worked it out. However, his baby mama is a pest. She would call his phone fussing about how if he didn’t go to the gender reveal and other baby-related functions and actively participate, take pictures with her, and cater to her financially she would never let him see his child. She also purposely did things like plan her reveal and baby shower around the same time as mine. I told my husband if he were to leave any of my parties and attend hers he could Forget about us healing our marriage and that I would be through with him! I am his wife so I come first! I didn’t ask for any of this nor did I deserve it! I let him financially provide what he could because that is his child, but attending and taking pictures with his BabyMama was a no. Plus Gender reveals, baby showers, etc.. are events for the mother, not the baby so why would he need to go?

Anyways, Fast forward months later we both go into labor on the same day. It was surprising to us all because she wasn’t supposed to go into labor for another month. Turns out her baby was premature. My baby was born first. Her baby was born 2 hours later. I understand my husband has another child and that he's innocent in all of this! I'm not hateful or spiteful towards his child. I'm not an evil person! However, I faced major complications during childbirth, and I passed out 10 minutes after delivery. Not to mention I have separation anxiety and was having a mental episode. I told him he was under no circumstance to leave me alone even if the doctors were in the room. He went to see about his other child a day later. I would have let my husband go to see his child’s birth, but after delivery, I was extremely sick, overwhelmed, and just didn't want to be surrounded by random doctors and nurses all alone. And he was the only person I had at the hospital during birth. I know this all sounds so shitty on all of our behalfs, but I was just so stressed and now I feel like such a horrible person for it. Was I an AH?"

I work at this gay strip club and every Friday I see this man named Henry that gives me the most amount money. As I said every single Friday I see him and sometimes we go hang with each other. Pretty sure he’s the only person I’ll ever want to be with. Well here comes the problem, after my shift yesterday I saw this random woman waiting for me at the back exit. She told me to stay away from her bf or she’ll find me and I would like what will happen. I asked who was her bf and like date will have it it was Henry. After I asked her that she can’t get the hint that her bf was probably gay. She told me to stop saying nonsense then she finally hit me.

For privacy, no names.

So I (22NB) live with my partner (20F) &amp; my sister (19F) and recently we've come to find that my sister is pregnant. She lied to us and said she was using protection, when apparently she didn't a few times. Well, it caught up to her. She ended up late for her period, so she took three tests yesterday, all of them being positive.

For some background, we live in a very small (650sqft) 2bdr apartment, and my sisters room is about half the size of mine and my partners. There's no room for a baby. Not a crib, not a changing table, not diapers, wipes, baby clothes, anything. We also live directly under an older couple (late 40s ish) who happens to be our landlords, and I very much doubt they'll allow a baby. We live pay check to pay check, so there's no money for a baby, either.

I will admit, my initial reaction was not great. I was livid, I'm still livid. Not wearing protection when you KNOW the consequences and can't afford a baby? Don't have room for a baby? I'm sorry, but that's pretty stupid to me. Plus she's known this guy for less than a year and he's never been tested for STD's (And yes he's slept with people before her) Which means she also put herself at risk for that, too. However it's not my problem if she gets an STD. A baby though, since we all live together, is also my problem.

Anyways, I told her she needs to very thoroughly think things through. Cost, room, where we'll live, how she'll have the time, (She works full time) How she'll afford her own life let alone a baby especially if she doesn't work, how she'll take care of it, etc etc. I told her she needs to genuinely consider an abortion. She said no, that she doesn't want one, she's not getting one, she won't kill her baby, and that she **knows** she'll regret it if she does it. She was yelling at me at this point so I asked her to breathe and told her she can't just flat out refuse to even think about it. She needs to consider all of her options, because I don't know how this is possibly going to work. She said ""I'll make it work! It'll be fine. But I am NOT getting an abortion!"" I said she has to at least *think* about it, and actually take time with it. She got really upset and said ""So what, you *want* me to get an abortion?!""  


I told her, in no way at all am I going to force her to do so or tell her she needs to. I won't make her get one. That's not my place or choice. But I WILL tell her she needs to THINK about one.  
She's mad at me and went into her room and closed the door. I don't think it's wrong to tell her she needs to think this through and consider her options, but I've also never been pregnant and don't know how she's feeling right now.

AITA?"

xo8ta7_2819,xo8ta7,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"I’m a first time poster and on mobile, and this is a long one. I am sorry for my sin. 

I (25F) agreed to be my best friend’s (we’ll call her Jill) (28F) MOH at her wedding next year. She got engaged in April of last year and has set a date for next October, and I have held her hand through most of the planning process so far and been there for her as much as she wanted. She wanted to try on wedding dresses a couple weeks ago because she “knows herself and knows it will be a very long process” because she is “picky”. Fair enough. So, she invites me, one of her other friends, her 3 sisters, her fiancé’s grandmother and mother, her mother, and her fiancé’s sister to a bridal shop for her to try on dresses. I was a little confused as to why so many people for the first try-on, but didn’t say anything because this was her wedding and I wanted to support her. 

So, I get to the bridal salon and it is absolute chaos. Her sisters (all adults) are literally running around the salon looking at dresses and pulling them off the racks, her mother and future MIL were looking at dresses for themselves and Jill is talking to the consultant. Once there are enough chairs and a large enough space for the group, Jill starts to try on dresses. 3 dresses in, she’s decided this is the one that she wants. Great, fantastic! We all cheer for her and once she changes out of the dress and back into her clothes, she suggests that her bridesmaids start looking in that section for something they’d like and maybe try on a few to gather some ideas. Jill ends up choosing a design that she wants us to wear and in the color she wants, so the consultant comes around to gather our sizes. Mind you, I am by no means a big girl, but Jill, the other friend, her sisters, and her fiancé’s sister are all very slender and petite. So they all say their sizes (between 0 and 4), and I say I am a size 10. The consultant nods and writes it down, no reaction. Her sisters looked at me and her oldest one says, “Well, you’ll lose weight for the wedding.” I had no intention of doing that as I felt comfortable in my body for once (I’ve struggled with ED my whole life), but Jill nodded and agreed with her sister stating that was a “goal” of hers, for me to lose weight. When we all put on the dresses, they were flattering to everyone except for me (the proportions were wrong, the sleeves were too tight, etc.) and it was not a dress I’d pick for myself, but Jill was thrilled with how we all looked and decided those were the dresses we were going to wear. Jill then told us that we’re going to buy them now and we can figure out shoes and jewelry later. I knew that I would be paying for my own dress, accessories, and hair, but I was planning on saving up more before the wedding a little over a year away because of a limited income. The dress was almost $200, which was almost the entirety of my account due to being a poor college kid (which I thought we all were given her sisters and fiancé’s sister are younger, and I am in my last year of vet school. Jill graduated last year with a bachelor’s). Turns out, Jill’s mom was paying for her daughters’ and Jill’s fiancé’s sister’s dresses, but the other friend and I were expected to pay for ours today as well. Jill expressed concern over all of us not ordering dresses at the same time after I told her that it might have to wait a week or two to fit my budget, so I decided to avoid an unhappy friend and bought the dress. After we checked out, I felt totally humiliated and cried in my car for a few minutes before driving away. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, my boyfriend gave me a promise ring because he is supposed to leave in a couple months for a 7-month long internship out of state and his intention is to get formally engaged and start planning a wedding when he returns and I’m settled into my residency. I was touched and posted a picture of the ring on my hand with the word “promise” as the caption on Snapchat. About a half an hour later, Jill messages me, completely angry. She accused me of trying to steal her thunder by getting engaged to someone she didn’t know all that well (my bf and I have been together for 3 years) while she was trying to plan a wedding. I explained that it wasn’t an engagement ring, it was a placeholder of sorts for when my bf returns from his internship. She said she didn’t know anything about him leaving for so long and that she should’ve been told first about the ring, not Snapchat. I apologized and we continued the conversation normally, but when Jill and I were talking and she asked me if I was okay and if our friendship was okay, I basically told her no, we weren’t okay. After the incident at the bridal shop, I reflected on our relationship and realized that this was not the first time I have felt humiliated by her, and after the conversation we just had, I wasn’t sure that I could handle feeling shut down as frequently as she shuts me down (she almost never asks about my life and when I do share, she says that she doesn’t care). She calls me and starts to cry and tells me that I’m attacking her and ruining her happy time by prioritizing a “random guy” over her. I had enough and told her that I couldn’t be there for her at her wedding and that my bf is not some random guy and she would know that if she ever let me talk about my life with her. 

TL;DR: My best friend humiliated me and doesn’t listen to me, so I dropped out of being her MOH. 

I made a commitment to be her MOH, but now we’re not friends. Should I patch things up and apologize? Am I the asshole?"

xozgt8_2866,xozgt8,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The title might soung weird, but hear me out.

I (20F) have a sister (23F) who gave birth to a small devil almost 4 years ago.
We've never been really close, growing up, she was the rebel, outgoing kid, she caused nothing but trouble but for some reason, everyone loved her. 
I've always been the opposite. I was quiet, I used to spend most of the time studying, I hate socializing, kids, loud people and a ton of other things. I'm also neurodivergent (this detail is important for the story) so it's hard for me to fit in my family's loud and embarassing habits.

My sister (let's call her Maya) started dating an older man when she was 16 (and I'm not talking about 5/6 years difference... A lot more), and decided to introduce him to the family only after she announced she was pregnant at 19. Her boyfriend is a nightmare. He's the dumbest person I've met so far, he never talks about serious things, he uses irony for every topic, he's embarassing at family meetings/public festivals and he judges people too much.

And here's the point. As a neurodivergent person, I have special needs. I freak out when people are too loud, or too many people talk to me at once, and I'm extremely sensitive to everything. Maya's S.O. doesn't understand this, and does everything he can to make me and my sister argue over their daughter. He wants me (I'm Italian and I'm currently studying in Norway, but I go back home twice a month) to take care of their daughter everytime I go back home. 

She's extremely spoiled, she screams like a banshee when you try to tell her ""no"", she bites, punches and hit me almost everytime I see her, she doesn't know what boundaries are and she acts like everything is hers. When I try to correct her, Maya's boyfriend screams at me because ""I have no right to tell his daughter how to behave"", and my sister thinks he's right. That kid always triggers my autistic meltdowns, and I'm honestly tired of wasting the little time I have to stay in my home country because of a spoiled brat and her dumb parents.

I confronted my sister about this, and I politely told her that my mental health is more important than their ""time off"" as parents, that meltdowns are extremely hard and tiring for me, and that if they need a babysitter they should pay one, instead of leaving that small beelzebub with me for three days, expecially knowing that I study and work in another Country and have little to no time to spend with my family and friends when I go back home. 
She told me I'm using my neurodivergency to run away from my responsibilities, and that I'm an AH for refusing to spend time with my niece. 

I honestly think that it's not my fault if she decided to change her life for the worse and have a baby when she clearly wasn't ready, and that my niece is not MY responsibility, she's not my daughter. They should teach her how to behave properly before asking people to take care of her.

So, AITAH?"

A few weeks leading up to my girlfriend going into labor she had quit her management position at the bank which caused me having to work a handful of extra hours at the construction site. I was in a huge amount of pain all the time since I do not have the best legs due to a football injury I encounter during highschool but I knew what my girlfriend was going through so even after working long hours I still came home and tended to her every need. I will not tell a lie I was tad bit irritated that she quit her job. They was giving her a large amount of maternity leave and she only had one shift left before her maternity leave started. Anyways during this time my girlfriend has been very rude, controlling &amp; mean. After working a 8+ hour shift, coming home &amp; making her her favorite meal I had just a little bit of energy to go watch a fight with my best friend. I told my girlfriend my plans and she basically told me I can’t go because she could go into labor any minute. I ofc stayed home but everytime I wanted to step out and hang with the guys she would come with same excuse just for her to not go into labor for another 2 weeks. 


My girlfriend goes into labor she’s in a huge amount of pain &amp; im fresh off of a 10hour  shift. We’re at the hospital and she’s yelling and in pain. I’m asking her what it is she needs me to do she’s yelling at me, calling me useless and told me to shut the fuck up and leave her alone so I did. We’re sitting there in complete silence for about 45mins, she tells me that she is sorry for the way she’s been acting and that she knows I am tired. Told me that the pain isn’t that bad rn so I can take a nap until the baby comes . I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. So now I am resting my eyes for abt an hour when she screams my name. I assume the baby was coming so I got up and got into position. But she just started to scream at me saying I’m an ass hole of a boyfriend to be sleep while she’s in labor. Told me that the mom and baby she come 1sr and I have not been doing anything but adding stress to her. I tried to explain to her that I do not think that that is true and that she’s just saying these things because she’s in pain.  She told me that she means everything she’s saying and that it’s all about her and the baby and the only thing I am doing is sleeping. 

I told her if she feels like that fine  but I am taking a walk. Told her she will not continue to act like this towards me and the only thing I’ve done the last few weeks was put  myself last. 

So AITA?"

Every October I have a hard time budgeting because my car tags are due &amp; they're around $300 the 1st year (I lease my cars).  My Mother has always said she will help me pay my bills if needed.  I've avoided asking her for help because I'm trying to be an adult responsible for her own bills.  Well, the cost of the bills I pay for the household went up a lot this past year.  So, I decided to call in Mom's offer.  Well, she hit the roof.  After several days of going back &amp; forth, she offered to pay off my credit card bill in lieu of paying her share of the money I pay for household expenses ($100(expenses) vs $600(credit card bill).  She claimed that she would be going in the hole by paying the $100/month.  Granted she gets $1000/mo more than I do in Social Security &amp; pension.  Anyway, I told her that I was uncomfortable taking any money from her if she was going to go into the hole by doing so.  But she insisted.  Now I'm having 2nd thoughts about asking her for the money in the 1st place.  AITA?"
xp8oj9_2886,xp8oj9,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I (22F) broke up with my ex of 3 years back in March. I felt bad but I was honestly not happy in the relationship and thought it was best to end things. (He would start arguments, I didn't feel appreciated, he wasn't interested in meeting my family or friends, etc) He didn't take it well and took it as far as going to my house in the middle of the night to convince me to stay. He would keep me up late at night guilt tripping me into staying with him but even after explaining to him I wasn't comfortable, he kept going. Eventually, he stopped and accepted the break up. He went ahead to say online that i was mentally ill and he is going to wait for me. Because of that, I blocked him on social media but he proceeded to contact me once more to tell me i was being childish for blocking him. I blocked him again thinking that is it. Boy was I wrong.

Before I blocked him, I discovered he added everyone on my friends list (we ended up having 100+ mutual friends), I told him that we weren't together anymore and it's creepy. He told me it was the right thing to do . So everything he posted, all my friends would send it to me. Fast forward to JULY, my friends would send me a post of him saying ""I'll announce some tea about my recent relationship, stay tuned"". The next day he posted that I cheated on him. All confused I tried to call and he declines. I called his friend and i admit I was mad because my ex added my whole family and friends, he's trying to make me look like that bad guy and he's the victim in the relationship. I was telling him that what his friend is doing is not cool but he kept defending him. His friend told me what my ex said might not even be true and my ex will take full responsibility if it was a lie. That i should give him a chance. Heck no. Eventually I found out who told my ex that and confronted them. They messaged him and lied to him. Then made a group chat, added me, proceeded to admit they lied, ""apologized"", and explain why they did it. They told me that they told my ex it was all false, but he won't let it go. He still goes on saying he's right. My friends send me everything he posts and they all have my back which is great and I love them. I didn't want to deal with it anymore so I just ignore the whole situation and moved on. 

Throughout this year, different people I knew or barely knew, messaged me saying my ex was harassing them and trying to find ""evidence"" but nada. My best friend since kindergarten messaged him to stop and went off at him. He posted the WHOLE conversation, begining to end, on his story and saying that she was attacking him and tried to make her look like a clown by putting notes on the side to make her look like she's in the wrong. Did not blur out names or profile photos...

Just recently, almost the end of the year, he made his cover photo of my best friend sending him a message saying nobody liked him and didn't blur out her photo... It's very creepy... The message occurred months ago and he recently decided ""oh wow i have a great idea for a new cover photo"" I unblocked him and told him to stop acting this way and stop posting about my friend. He said he's entitled to post whatever he wants because I ""attacked"" his friend (The one I called before). I called the friend once again and he told me he didn't feel attacked, just a bit scared because I raised my voice. We both talked like adults, shook hands and apologized. 

My ex told me I was immature for telling him to stop posting. He said it was hypocritical of me to lurk on his page, that he is surprised that i found out and that i need to reflect on my actions. Sweetie you're blocked, you added everyone i knew and cried on your story about how some people unfollowed you because they're bad people for defending a ""cheater"". I never would've found out about any this if he just deleted all my friends and family or people I barely even knew, just like i did with his friends and family. I really just want to move on and forget about him but he won't stop posting. I understand that he can post whatever but don't post my friends face and names when all they did was defend me.

Notes if you wanna read:

1) I did tell my friends and family to unfollow, if they didn't that's their choice I am not the person to force someone to do something they don't want

2) I didn't constantly contact him, just when he posted the allegation and when he made my best friend as his cover photo. He kept running his mouth the whole year, but i wasn't going to stoop down to his level and fight him.

3) he mentions on his story that he doesn't try to see what i do but he contacts people on my friends list and keeps requesting to be accepted

4) it's already going to be October, I've been moving on, almost done with school and haven't posted anything about my ex or haven't been mentioning him at all, i guess this one is a first. I'm at a happy place right now and it's safe to say, i made the right choice breaking up with him.

So, AITAH for telling him to stop?"

This is my first ever post so I’m not sure if I’m posting in the right place. Sorry

Update: I didn’t realize how much feedback I got on this. But I appreciate everyone’s opinions even the ones saying I’m the AH. The way I asked the question could’ve definitely been in a better way but it caught me off guard as my friend had just died 2 days before I made this post. I did talk to her and she said it’d be best that I go to the funeral and she’d just take him to his open house because I’d regret not going to my friends funeral and she even helped me shop for some clothes too. She knows how I am with this.. I’ve only missed 2 out of 7 funerals because they were super far away. But again thank you everyone for your inputs. Really helped me to believe my decision to go to the funeral wasn’t the wrong decision."
xprzmn_2906,xprzmn,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (27) female recently called Child protective services on my sister Bethany (34) and her boyfriend Martin(33). My sister Bethany has three children with her boyfriend, Micheal (13), Sarah (7), and Susie (2). Martin has struggled with alcolholim for the past 13 years and has gotten 4 DUIs, has totaled 3 vehicles leaving the famoly with no way to get around, and shows no remorse for his behavior. When he drinks he becomes very destructive and destroys my sisters home, punches holes in the wall, slams things, calls my sister the worst names, and does all of this in front of his children who are terrified of him. Recently my nephew micheal (13) disclosed to my mother (his grandmother) that he is afraid that his father is going to hit his mom and that he wishes he would go away. My mother promised to call the police next time this happens and told Micheal to call her if she needs to do that. Backstory, my mother has tried to financially support and convince my sister to leave Martin many times over the years but Bethany always takes advantage of her help and then returns back to Martin who makes false promises to change, but then returns to this behavior. 

Recently, my sister Bethany sent me a text that was not supposed to go to me stating “the baby is asleep on the couch, i will call you if he starts again. He won’t do anything with you on the phone.” I immediately called her and she explained that the text was supposed to go to a friend and that Martin had driven home drunk and that he was screaming at her calling her names, breaking things, and eventually locked himself in the master bedroom where my Susie’s crib is located, so she would have to sleep on the couch. When i told her to call the police and that he is abusing her she said that she would if he did it again. However I heard Michael say in that back ground to call his grandmother. I remembered that Micheal associates his grandmother / my mother with the police so after hanging up I called the police and asked them to do a wellness check as my sister is in an abusive household and I am unsure if she and her kids are okay. When the police arrived, she kept Martin in the bedroom and lied to them saying that they had a silly fight and that it was really nothing to worry about. She called me FURIOUS however I still heard slamming and yelling in the background. My sister has recently told me that she needs him to get out and that she would call the cops if he continued to scare the children and  drink and drive etc. so i was confused as to why she didn’t tell the officers the truth. 

An hour later, i made a CPS call and told them everything. I wanted them to stop scaring the kids after and before school, and be good parents and i felt like CPS would force my sister to be truthful and accept that this man is abusing her and the kids. However when they came she again lied about the abuse. Her kids however did not and now she has follow up visits from CPS until this case is closed. She has cut me off ever since and blocked me on everything. I feel awful and even though I felt like i was doing the right thing at the time, i now question if iit was worth losing all contact with my sister. Was i wrong?"

Martin has struggled with alcolholim for the past 13 years and has gotten 4 DUIs, has totaled 3 vehicles leaving the famoly with no way to get around, and shows no remorse for his behavior. When he drinks he becomes very destructive and destroys my sisters home, punches holes in the wall, slams things, calls my sister the worst names, and does all of this in front of his children who are terrified of him. Recently my nephew micheal (13) disclosed to my mother (his grandmother) that he is afraid that his father is going to hit his mom and that he wishes he would go away. My mother promised to call the police next time this happens and told Micheal to call her if she needs to do that. Backstory, my mother has tried to financially support and convince my sister to leave Martin many times over the years but Bethany always takes advantage of her help and then returns back to Martin who makes false promises to change, but then returns to this behavior. 

Recently, my sister Bethany sent me a text that was not supposed to go to me stating “the baby is asleep on the couch, i will call you if he starts again. He won’t do anything with you on the phone.” I immediately called her and she explained that the text was supposed to go to a friend and that Martin had driven home drunk and that he was screaming at her calling her names, breaking things, and eventually locked himself in the master bedroom where my Susie’s crib is located, so she would have to sleep on the couch. When i told her to call the police and that he is abusing her she said that she would if he did it again. However I heard Michael say in that back ground to call his grandmother. I remembered that Micheal associates his grandmother / my mother with the police so after hanging up I called the police and asked them to do a wellness check as my sister is in an abusive household and I am unsure if she and her kids are okay. When the police arrived, she kept Martin in the bedroom and lied to them saying that they had a silly fight and that it was really nothing to worry about. She called me FURIOUS however I still heard slamming and yelling in the background. My sister has recently told me that she needs him to get out and that she would call the cops if he continued to scare the children and  drink and drive etc. so i was confused as to why she didn’t tell the officers the truth. 

An hour later, i made a CPS call and told them everything. I wanted them to stop scaring the kids after and before school, and be good parents and i felt like CPS would force my sister to be truthful and accept that this man is abusing her and the kids. However when they came she again lied about the abuse. Her kids however did not and now she has follow up visits from CPS until this case is closed. She has cut me off ever since and blocked me on everything. I feel awful and even though I felt like i was doing the right thing at the time, i now question if iit was worth losing all contact with my sister. Was i wrong?"

I usually get kids staring, pointing, and talking about my head. It seems like I should be used to it but it still hits me a bit. I don’t usually tell kids under 5/6 years, since they are too young to understand. But after that age, I feel like people should know better.

A few months ago we went shopping in a local store, and there was this kid (7) staring at me. The type of staring where you move your body to maintain your view. I said “Could you please not stare?” And the father told me she was only 7 so she “(language) doesn’t know better.” 

There was a second incident later in another store that is very similar to this one, except the mother said “She’s 7, she’s only trying to look around.”

I feel like you shouldn’t be upset for me politely asking for people to act human. And I sometimes start feeling like maybe I just shouldn’t say anything. 

So AITA (/WIBTA) for asking people to not stare at me since it makes me feel uncomfortable?"

xq08rs_2921,xq08rs,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,I (16f) have a grandma (56f) who is very set on only talking about her sons death. About a decade ago her son was killed. I understand that we all grieve for longer or shorter times than others but she has to talk about him in every single conversation she has. For example if we are talking about a holiday of any sort she will say something like “I remember when he did blah blah blah on this holiday.” She also talked about him at my uncle’s funeral and tried to make it about him. Last weekend was my sisters birthday and my grandmother happened to come along which was weird because her and my sister don’t get along. I thought she was gonna be nice to my sister on her birthday and not make it about her son. Wrong. The whole night she kept making comments about how her son was amazing and how she wished he was here. I could see how uncomfortable my sister was.She literally told my sister that she wished it was his birthday instead of hers. I snapped and told my grandmother that she needs to get it the fuck together. I asked her if she could not hold her  tongue about her son for one event and if she even thought about what she said to my sister. She started sobbing and said that I had no love for her or her son and left with some of my other family. I’m now receiving angry texts from my family saying that I was an a-hole for what I said to my grandmother and that she was still grieving. My mom hasn’t said anything about the situation but I think she is upset with me also. So AITA?

He never had much of a close relationship with my sister (20F) but they shared common interests like Hockey and PlayStation.

She knows why we broke-up and has been very helpful and supportive, or at least was at the start. He had intentions of cheating on me while in the relationship and then when we tried working things out he wen’t and slept with someone else then broke it off with me. Again, my sister knows all this.

They had only talked a few times and from my knowledge got along but never texted or played games together even though they had each-other added on playstation.

About two weeks after him and I cut contact she told me that she was texting him and playing games with him. Every single time she would text him or play games with him she would go out of her way to make sure I knew.

For this I got pissed off at her saying she is only doing it to tick me off and that I personally find it odd that she is texting my ex-boyfriend who is much younger than her.
She only started texting him after him and I cut contact.

So am I the asshole for getting mad at her?

xqbmmp_2934,xqbmmp,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I've know this guy for 2 years and we attend the same university.

Recently, however he has started making comments about my appearance (how hot I looked or that I have nice legs) that made me uncomfortable. He would always try to hug me claiming it was comforting and calming for him. I limited contact as much as possible.

However one day he called me asking to meet up and grab a beer. After I told him no, since I didn't want to see him and I was sick, he told me laughing he would shove a bottle beer inside of me. I just told him to fuck off.

The next day he apologised and asked to meet. I refused and he accused me of throwing the friendship away over a bad joke. I stood my ground and told him off.

One month later he texted me an apology and I said the I appreciated that he saw he fucked up.

Another month later he asked to meet and I did not text him back and 2 week later he started complaining I was ignoring him and that he had to ""chase me"" . He also said he missed me and he would often check our chat. He also told he was the only one still caring about the friendship. That did not work on me and I was livid.
Then he sent a text calling me a hypocritical, cold, uncaring and manipulative asshole and that I did not care about him. He deleted it immediately afterwards, but I had already read it.

So I sent him an audio telling him to fuck off and to never contact me again. Then I blocked him everywhere.

My friends agree with me but was I too harsh?"

Since our wedding, I've tried to initiate sex multiple times and she's always said no and given an excuse of feeling tired or being busy or something. I've never pressed her and will usually take care of things myself if I have to. Just yesterday, she told me she had something important to tell me and said she was asexual. I understand being afraid to come out to anyone but I was caught a bit off guard as this wasn't mentioned at all during our relationship and I felt that I had been misled and lied to.

Of course, I'm not just with her for sex and I want to make this work. I've tried to brainstorm and have asked if she'd be comfortable with me having am FWB relationship with others or even soliciting prostitutes or even if she'd be wanting to have sex even if she isn't interested in it. All of these have been declined (I admit some of these were just thrown out there without much thought or desire for them) but wouldn't offer any of her own suggestions.

I admit I kind of lost my cool and snapped at her for keeping something so big from me when she knew about my own issues. She started crying and I immediately felt like shit. She said she didn't tell me beforehand because she was worried I wouldn't want to marry her. I went for a walk to get some space and I'm currently typing this from a Cafe.

I'm not sure how to proceed. I think that if I was told before we were married, this would be easier to deal with but the fact that she kept it from me and lied to me about such a big thing is making it a bit hard to process. I'm also not really looking forward to a life of 'taking care of it myself'.

xquo0y_2960,xquo0y,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I, 26 m have a little brother 25 m. K.

We used to have an older brother P(33m), he committed suicide in July 2022.

We were all crushed by this.

K had always had suicidal thoughts, and depression, but has managed for years. He has worked at my Parents business for 4 years with the promise that it would eventually become his. He also got into a car accident a year ago and has been using a spare car the family had ( one of 4) for commuting since.

K has been taking P’s death really hard. But he is seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist and getting counseling. 

K has also run into financial troubles with the crypto crash and lost a significant amount of money. 

All my parents care about is their money and reputation. They refused to get P diagnosed b/c it would be “scandalous”, if they ever want to talk about anything personal, we have to meet at a restaurant OUTSIDE OF THE CITY, so nobody can hear.

My parents had never taken P’s mental health seriously, and now that he is gone, have started to believe that it’s not psudeoscience. Though publicly they are blaming his death on medication P was subscribed a couple months prior.

About a month and a half ago K told my father that he was feeling suicidal and he drove my brother to a psych facility, my dad did not put him any particular program, so K was like in a weird 1 size fits all program with drug addicts and violent offenders.

K was released in a week. And he has new meds and is working on bettering himself.

K still wakes up everyday with panic attacks and vomits and has massive anxiety. 

He still goes in and works at my parents business.

Lately, they have been extremely hard on K. Saying he is not fit to be a manager or own a business. He tells them he has anxiety attacks every morning, but they push it off.

Yesterday my parents told my brother he now has to pay for the business over time, and has to pay for the family car out of pocket asap and they are kicking him off their insurance.

I have learned long ago to not trust my parents and to not take their money as it has strings attached. I am living independent and comfortable. I’m not millionaires like them, but I’m good and growing in my career.

My brother told me this and how he feels depressed and that this is just another punch down from them. I got mad, i got pissed. 

This is their attempt to make him more responsible. The tough love. 

They loved to do this same shit to P. 

This is where I might be the asshole, i sent a text in the family groupchat. And I went hard 

I included my parents, my brother, and my SIL (P’s wife). And I basically pointed out that our brother has been dead no less than 3 months and they are punching down my other brother with a history of depression and suicide. That they have no ability to see the context behind K’s behavior, beyond their inconvenience. 

While it is appropritate to have K pay his own, now is not the time to focus on that.

That I am glad I have not accepted any gifts from them in 3 years, and that they always come with strings attached. 

That this same tough love shit is what they pulled on P all the time. Look what happened to him.

They have betrayed K’s and I’s trust several years ago, and they still have yet to earn it back.

That they risk losing their other 2 kids if they do not stop this malarky, and agree to see a bipartisan family therapist. 

My mom is pissed at me, since I made my dad cry. She says I am a spoiled brat. So reddit AITA?

K and SIL are behind me. But did I go too far?"

She loved the attention she got from it. Anyways, she showed up to my wedding in a trumpet style prom looking dress that was completely white. It could’ve fooled anyone to think she was the bride. I decided not to cause a scene, as I didn’t want that to ruin my night, even though I was highly offended. The next day she asked why I barely spoke to her, claiming that it was rude of me to not greet all of my guests. Which I did, but I made a point to ignore her, something I knew would piss her off. (She wouldn’t be getting the attention she wanted!!) I explained that I found it extremely rude of her to wear a dress like that to my wedding. Not to mention that it was white. She said that because I never specified that no one could wear white, it wasn’t her fault. But here’s what really got me. She told me it also wasn’t her fault she looked better that day. “We all have those moments” is what she said. I was furious, but I wanted to enjoy my new marriage, so I let it go. Well, about two months ago, I received a wedding invitation in the mail. From her. And in big bold letters it very clearly specified not to wear white. I found it amusing until I found out my mother’s invitation didn’t say anything about not wearing white. As much as I wanted to be impressed by her going out of her way to ensure I couldn’t pay her back, I couldn’t help but let my pettiness get the best of me. I bought a simple cocktail dress in white, and I wore it with pride. Unlike me, she yelled at me i’m front of everyone, asking why I would even think to be that disrespectful on her special day. I simply said that she knew why, and left soon after. Of course, her family and my grandma attacked me, saying I had no room to ruin her night like that. My family is on my side though, and my husband is too, so I don’t really care. My grandma is the only one that hurts because she knew what Jessica pulled at MY wedding.

The next day she asked why I barely spoke to her, claiming that it was rude of me to not greet all of my guests. Which I did, but I made a point to ignore her, something I knew would piss her off. (She wouldn’t be getting the attention she wanted!!) I explained that I found it extremely rude of her to wear a dress like that to my wedding. Not to mention that it was white. She said that because I never specified that no one could wear white, it wasn’t her fault. But here’s what really got me. She told me it also wasn’t her fault she looked better that day. “We all have those moments” is what she said. I was furious, but I wanted to enjoy my new marriage, so I let it go. Well, about two months ago, I received a wedding invitation in the mail. From her. And in big bold letters it very clearly specified not to wear white. I found it amusing until I found out my mother’s invitation didn’t say anything about not wearing white. As much as I wanted to be impressed by her going out of her way to ensure I couldn’t pay her back, I couldn’t help but let my pettiness get the best of me. I bought a simple cocktail dress in white, and I wore it with pride. Unlike me, she yelled at me i’m front of everyone, asking why I would even think to be that disrespectful on her special day. I simply said that she knew why, and left soon after. Of course, her family and my grandma attacked me, saying I had no room to ruin her night like that. My family is on my side though, and my husband is too, so I don’t really care. My grandma is the only one that hurts because she knew what Jessica pulled at MY wedding. I don’t know, I know it was petty, but AITAH?"

We haven’t had the best relationship, it has been getting increasingly worse. We haven’t been spending time together lately and it seems we no longer have anything in common. He didn’t work or help out around the house, so I have been bitching more and telling him that I am tired of supporting him in my disability. He’s perfectly capable of working he just chooses not to and when I bring it up I’m told that it is because I wasn’t encouraging of him in the past pursuing a flipping houses, that we couldn’t afford the startup, that he wanted to start because I felt it was a pipe-line dream. He hasn’t worked since then, about 5 years ago, and when I tell him we can’t afford something he wants he pouts and whines  until I get annoyed and give in putting us in financial strain. That is kinda off subject but a little background on our relationship.

Here lately he got extremely wasted and decided to call me a whore. I have a past ( when I was 13 I was SA’d and after that I did go through a faze where I was because to me it no longer meant anything and I would have rather have it away then have it taken) He claimed he didn’t remember anything from that night and after a few days I tried my hardest to forgive him. 

That brings us to last night. In an attempt to connect and spend time together I downloaded the SkyView app. When we first got together we went camping a lot and bonded over the stars. I asked him to come outside and after finding a few constellations I noticed you could still see Jupiter extremely good. When pointing it out here at first said it wasn’t so I showed him on the app. He seemed excited and was saying that it was a once in a lifetime to be able to see it that clear. He then disappeared. I stayed where I was thinking he just had to use the restroom and found some more constellations I thought he would enjoy. After about 20 minutes I went to make sure he was okay. I went into the house and he wasn’t there so I went outside and walked around a few times calling his name. After about 5 minutes our neighbors called out to me over the fence to come bring him home. That hurt me, probably more than it should that he went there to tell them to come outside and look at Jupiter with them. So I just kept walking and went back to our front door. When he finally decided I was good enough to spend time with again he tried to come back home. I told him that was the last time I would ever try spend time with him or try and reconnect again. I told him that I’m just done. He ignored everything I said and asked for a lighter so I told him to just leave. He knocked on the door until I answered and just complained that it was cold so he needed his shoes. I threw his shoes out and ignored the knocks for the rest of the night.

I called one of my friends to talk and she said that I was being ridiculous. So now I need to know aita for quitting our marriage?"

Hi everyone

So my sister is a 16-year-old highschooler and she recently started dating a 22-year-old, who has a working job.

They are in the same sports club and this is where they met. They have known each other for like 1 year and they started dating a few weeks ago.

He is an overall nice guy, but I think it is really weird for an adult (even though he is young I consider him as an adult) to date a teenager. 

When my sister and my mother told me about their relationship, I had a negative reaction. 

I don't know if her boyfriend is grooming her and I'm a bit worried about her as she is quite young. 

Our mother thinks it is okay and she told me that my sister was a bit disappointed about my reaction and that it could damage my sister's and I relationship.



I live in France, so it's legal, but I don't think it's morally okay."

My other niece is 2 and needs constant attention. My family and I had told my sister prior to her getting a job that she needs to find some kind of babysitting system since she can’t handle the 2year old while working, but of course she didn’t. 

My family pressured me(25F) to babysit because I’m unemployed. They were saying things like “it’s only temporary” “you’ll only do it for the meantime” “she just needs you for now until she figures something out” “we’re family, we should be able to rely and help each other”
 
I would only be babysitting on the weekdays so I agreed cause it was temporary. I was planning on doing it for a month since they never gave me a set time frame on how long I’ll be babysitting. 

Monday when I came over to her house I asked if she’s looking for other babysitting alternatives cause I was only willing to help babysit for month. She said “no, you’re my babysitter. Why only a month?”

I explained to her that I’ve been job hunting. Then she said “you just messed up my plans cause I need you to babysit for me from now on”

At that point my anger level went up to a 9 cause I felt like I was tricked into being the full time babysitter when I thought it was temporary.

Tuesday I told her I can’t be job hunting while I’m babysitting at her house cause what if I need to go in for an interview or training. Then she said “you gotta give me a few weeks heads up so I can figure something out. But I need you here, you’ll babysit until you’re officially employed”. I stood my ground and said no.

I overheard her and my eldest sister talking shit about me like how I was being a selfish brat. I didn’t care cause they’re the ones who tricked me. Later I found out her mother-in-law WANTED to babysit the baby cause she was on vacation for a month but my sister doesn’t want the baby there cause it’ll beat the purpose of her working from home.

Her mother-in-law is WILLING to babysit, my mom is a stay-at-home mom. And I’m still trying to figure out my own life. Not dedicate it to watching her kids. 

Thursday she tried to make a peace offering by offering boba and I refused it then she asked why I was mad and I told her “I’m not obligated to answer that question”. I don’t see the point of explaining my feelings to her nor anyone in my family when they’re just gonna invalidate it and gaslight.

My sister had left the family, siblings, and sisters group chat. She also removed me from socials. I overheard her venting to someone of how selfish and inconsiderate I was. She’s cutting me off and this time she means it. At family functions she’s just gonna see me as a guest. 

This wouldn’t be the first time she has cut me off. She does it whenever we have big arguments. My family had already chosen to side with her and they’re going to blame me for breaking up the family.  So am I the asshole?"

It was 9:00 in the morning and our date was in an hour meaning I didn’t get much time to get ready as I wanted to make the date super special. I wore a dress he bought me when we were just 5 months and shoes I bought 3 days before the anniversary. I straightened my hair and styled it and all of that caused me to have 20 minutes left until the date started. Liam had texted me saying he’s gonna be 15 minutes late and I assumed that was because he was making a special surprise for us so I just responded with a quick “ok!” I had went to the restaurant 10 minutes early and waited for about 30 minutes, when I had texted him asking when he was coming he told me that he couldn’t go because his dad needed him for something important and he lives about 20 minutes away from him. I asked why it was so important and he didn’t respond. It’s been nearly 10 minutes. 

I texted him saying, “Liam, I have prepared a lot for our one year anniversary. I thought this was something special for us, what is so important that you have to miss it?” He read it and rudely asked if it was a prank as I always joke around with him. I was so disappointed. He texted me telling me that he had forgotten and thought we were going on a regular date. I was so upset and tears were about to come out of my eyes. I waited a while to see if he would respond and apologize and to also calm myself down. I had left the restaurant and walked to my car as I didn’t get a response but right when I open my car door I see his car parking. When he had left the car, his appearance had seemed to have no effort. He quickly ran to me and apologized.

I told him to give me a couple days and that I didn’t wanna talk to him at the moment. I went in my car and was on my way home. I quickly noticed that his car was following mine and when I got home I opened the door and went inside locking it quickly. I get a text shortly after of Liam telling me to open the door so that we could talk about it. I ignored the text for nearly 20 minutes and prepared some food, I couldn’t get my mind off of it so I shortly left the food I was preparing on the counter and unlocked the door. To my surprise he had already left. I started to cry.

I sent him paragraphs of how I had prepared so much for our anniversary and he just shows up effortlessly dressed and had just left without understanding that I needed some time until I wanted to talk to you and just left. He told me that he was genuinely sorry and that he had left because I made him wait outside for nearly 20 minutes without hearing his explanation. I called him asking for his explanation and I heard his dad saying “So have you told her yet?” I asked Liam what his dad was talking about but he shortly ended the call and I knew it was something serious that he’s been keeping from me and I didn’t want to get more hurt mentally when I find out what it is so I chose to tell him that I wanted to break up to make things less complicated."

My uncle had left my younger cousin by himself, while being left alone he was chasing a chick that went into the house, The chick had went on the Large Mountain bike mounted on the wall he had tried to climb the bike the bike fell on him and hit his head. A few hours later he had called my parents and they went to visit him in the hospital. After they went home my mother told us that he had a blood clot in his head which led to him being escorted to a better hospital to have him treated properly, While he was being escorted to the other hospital he just flat lined, while we were waiting for some updates. They got a call from my uncle saying that my younger cousin had died on the ride to the other hospital. My 2nd older sister threw a tantrum at my uncle while on call .

xstww8_3049,xstww8,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Am I the Asshole for breaking it off with my ex-girlfriend?

I was dating my ex-girlfriend a while ago, lets call her Sarah. We broke up, hence why she's my ex. And I wanna know if I'm the asshole for breaking up with her.

We were in a polyamorous relationship. I was kind of ok with it? It was my first experience with it, and I have gone on to have a really amazing relationship with my best friend and we are poly as well, but we're actually succeeding with the relationship.

But anyway. The reason I broke up with her was because she cheated. At least, I felt like she did. Let me explain. I was fine with her seeing/sleeping with other people. I'm asexual and people have needs, which I get. But I wanted to know before she did it, who it was with and when she was doing it. I also wanted to know where she would be too, so I knew she was safe. This was fine for a while. I made a few requests, such as I don't want people leaving marks because it stressed me out. She was fine with that and even apologized when it happened the first time since she didn't know. Which was good of her. But then came the incident which made me break up with her.

She was talking to me via discord, which we did a lot, and she asked me a question. ""Is it ok if I do *insert sexual act here* with my friend? They've asked me to do it."" I cannot for the life of me remember what the act was now but it was something to do with a mummy kink. Which is fine I suppose, each to their own. I told her that yes, I was fine with that. And she then replied, ""Oh great, because I already did it."" Now, this made my heart sink. I felt immediately upset with her when she told me this. I mean, why ask me if you've already frickin' done it? I told her as such, and she got upset. I tried to let it go but it just kept nagging at me. What else wasn't she telling me?

So pretty soon after, I broke up with her. She called me crying and got me to talk to her mother, which I hated. It made me feel terrible as a person and I ended up agreeing to stay with her with the promise of her never doing it again. The next day though, she broke it off with me anyway, stating she wanted to be with someone she'd been virtually dating for the duration of our relationship. I was kinda confused and annoyed by this but I didn't argue and just let it go. But the situations been bugging me. Some people told me I was the asshole for how I handled it and others, my current partner, my brother and sister included, told me I handled it as best I could. So I wanna know.

Am I the asshole for how I handled the situation?

Edit: To clarify, we weren’t in an open relationship so to speak. We were poly and we had expectations of each other. She had rules for me as well, just as I had for her. It was more suggestions/requests over rules. She also expected me to tell her if I had slept with or seen someone else, and had told me she’d be upset with me if I didn’t tell her on prior occasions when we discussed our relationship. My apologies for any confusion."

(Charlie has recently started identifying as a lesbian and using she/they pronouns, Charlie has also been struggling with body image issues and depression, keep that in mind for later.)

Last Sunday, two days before their flight, Jordan and Mylee were on the phone, talking about the move and how excited they were or whatever, and Charlie was sitting in Mylee’s room, on her phone not bothering anyone. Charlie made a comment to Mylee about a video she had seen, and jordan told her to “stfu d-ke, nobody cares” Charlie got really upset and Jordan laughed at her calling her a “sensitive f+g” and essentially telling her to well.., harm herself(he also made comments about her weight knowing that she has body image issues) and due to recent events with Jordan and Mylee i wasnt very pleased with them to start.

Charlie told me what happened the next day and i was less than pleased about this, when Charlie told me what Jordan said to her, i admit i freaked out a little bit, and probably went too far, but i walked into Mylees room and told her to call Jordan., she told me he was with his friends and i let her know that i didn’t give a shit. She eventually did call him and i basically, to sum it up told him that if he ever said something like that to charlie again i would castrate him., now i know this wasn’t the mature thing to say, but i couldn’t really filter myself. He told me he was “high” and doesn’t remember any of that.

I wasn’t buying it, so i told him that he needed to stop lying and own up to his actions.

She got really upset about this and called her mom to complain, her mom and her sister both agree with me, though what i said was a bit vulgar, but my grandmother has been blowing up my phone calling me a lot of things."
xtafv4_3075,xtafv4,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"My (15F) Cousin (17F) Mylee, has been dating a guy (18m) who we’ll call Jordan, for about a year, they recently decided to move to nc together to live with Jordan’s mom, They left on Tuesday, but before they left, Jordan would continuously make homophobic and just overall terrible comments to my cousin (13F) Charlie. (Charlie has recently started identifying as a lesbian and using she/they pronouns, Charlie has also been struggling with body image issues and depression, keep that in mind for later.)

Last Sunday, two days before their flight, Jordan and Mylee were on the phone, talking about the move and how excited they were or whatever, and Charlie was sitting in Mylee’s room, on her phone not bothering anyone. Charlie made a comment to Mylee about a video she had seen, and jordan told her to “stfu d-ke, nobody cares” Charlie got really upset and Jordan laughed at her calling her a “sensitive f+g” and essentially telling her to well.., harm herself(he also made comments about her weight knowing that she has body image issues) and due to recent events with Jordan and Mylee i wasnt very pleased with them to start.

Charlie told me what happened the next day and i was less than pleased about this, when Charlie told me what Jordan said to her, i admit i freaked out a little bit, and probably went too far, but i walked into Mylees room and told her to call Jordan., she told me he was with his friends and i let her know that i didn’t give a shit. She eventually did call him and i basically, to sum it up told him that if he ever said something like that to charlie again i would castrate him., now i know this wasn’t the mature thing to say, but i couldn’t really filter myself. He told me he was “high” and doesn’t remember any of that.

I wasn’t buying it, so i told him that he needed to stop lying and own up to his actions.

xtfah7_3080,xtfah7,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"So I 30(m) and my wife 29(F) have 2 kids together and I have a 3rd from before we met. I have always been adamant about only being comfortable having 3 kids total. She has always wanted to birth 3 herself. We both knew where the other person stood entering into this relationship and marriage. 

Now that we have our kids I want to go get a vasectomy so as to avoid any “accidents” from happening. My wife has basically said if I do this she will never forgive me as I’m “taking away her option” of having another child. I have said I am done and don’t want any more kids but she says we should talk about it again in a couple years. My thing is that she refuses to take any birth control or get an iud or anything. I feel like she is refusing to let me get a vasectomy because she thinks eventually we will slip up and then she will “accidentally” get pregnant. To me though her refusing to let me get a vasectomy is basically the same thing as her lying about being in BC. She is manipulating the situation in her favor so that she gets her way. 

Would I be the ass if I just got a vasectomy without her consent. I am 100 percent done having kids. I have often time told her that if she wants another child she will have to find another husband to have it with. I am very very much done."

I said alright and I tapped my door I placed a little strip of paper in my door hinge and closed the door to check if anyone opened the door and I did it over 3 days and told my dad's girlfriends son to not go in my room because I was painting my room (which was the truth) and I was moving the PS5 into the living room until I finished painting. But to no surprise my strip of paper showed that all 3 days he opened the door and went inside and my deposit at the end of the week showed once again someone was stealing my money most likely the son. So I brought my new evidence to the family again and my dad covered for them this time saying I'm too paranoid and the paper probably fell out or that they might have needed an extra ps5 remote and his excuse for the money was the same thing that I bought something and misplaced the receipt. Well I had had enough I waited 1 whole week then bought a spy camera off of Amazon that is pretty unnoticeable and put it up to have a good view of my whole room and door. And the day after I put it up I was reviewing the footage and I found out something disgusting and Terrible. It turns out the son was going into my room (already knew that) and stealing my money (already knew that) but not only that but also doing perverted stuff like sniffing my panties and jerking off on my pillow. I could not wait anymore with my evidence and took it directly to everyone including the son and played the whole video clip of him in my room and said if you don't give me my money back and get out I'm taking this video and my bank statements and all my receipts to the police and we will have a problem so finally am I the asshole for threatening my dad's girlfriend and her son with me turning him into the police and possibly serving jail time and possibly getting put on the sex offender registration (I'm underage) my dad thinks I went too far

I let him know I think of my animals as my children since I do not want any of my own. I brought up that I would like to buy a house in the next year or so and would like us to think about living together in a house now.

We got into a fight and he stated that he will not live with me with my cats. That he wants the cats to live outside if I want to live together. I was upset about this because 2 of my cats were shot at (but survived after taking to hospital) for being outside. After that, they are strictly inside cats. So I stated I choose my cats. My boyfriend then says I’m choosing my cats over him and his own health. I said yes, these are my babies. He stated he would get his own house down the street from whatever house I get… but I told him that it looks like we are going on separate paths as I want someone to live with and be with in the same roof.

We laughed at him but he seemed determined so we let it go. My dad poked fun at him but admitted he wanted to meet the woman that finally tamed his wild middle child. fast forward to the party and everyone is anxious to meet the girlfriend. We had just finished cutting the cake when my brother showed up with two girls, a short chubby one who looked to be in her late 30's and a skinny younger one. immediately the family greets them and we all assume they are mother and daughter so we refer our attention to the chubby woman. after a few moments my brother quiets everyone down and apologizes to the chubby girl and explains that the two women are sisters and that the younger one is his girlfriend.

there was a moment of awkward silence until my dad started laughing and walked over to my brother making a big scene about how that was his son and how big he scored getting a younger woman. Some relatives cheered him on and others just murmured in confusion. this girl seemed too young to even drive so I asked her for her age. My brother started brushing me off saying it didn't matter and that love was love but the girlfriend told him it wasn't a big deal. my brother was 28, this girl was 15!

Everyone lost their minds. I let my brother know this was so wrong in so many levels and that he was a predator. My dad stepped between us and demanded I apologized, I refused and told the girlfriend's sister she was a predator too for letting this happen. My dad slapped me, the party fell silent and my dad started ranting about how he married my mom when he was 22 and she was 15 and that it was normal for men to want younger women. I yelled back that my mother was miserable till the day she died and that if he thought that an adult dating a child was normal he was sick. my dad almost slap me again when my auntie, his sister, yelled back that it was true and that she, like my mom, was unhappy and wished someone had intervened before her marriage (she was 16 when she married her 30 y/o husband).

Her husband gets up, grabs her by the arm and demands to know what she's talking about, one of my other uncles starts defending my auntie and pulls her away. Everyone starts arguing, a fight breaks out, cops show up, EMTs are called. Four were arrested, three hospitalized, one divorced and multiple people cut ties with one another. My dad kicked me out and hasn't spoken to me since.

multiple people have reached out, blaming me for ruining my uncles birthday, for the feuds that have started, for my aunties divorce and for my brothers relationship breaking apart a few days later. I really don't think I'm the asshole, my brother is a fully grown man and she is a child who hasn't finishes puberty, AITA?

TLTR: 28 y/o brother presents his 15 y/o girlfriend to the family, family is morally divided, fight breaks out, people go to jail and the ER, uncle gets divorced, I'm blamed for everything. Why? bc I asked her age.

We started dating in her junior and my senior year, we did long distance while I went to law school in another state.When I came back I proposed and we got married.I thought we had the perfect life ( high paying jobs, great house, happy marriage). Until like a year ago, when my wife sat me down and told me she wanted an open marriage, I was shocked cause I thought we were fine.She explained our sex was amazing but she wanted to explore and experience new things. I didn’t know what to say and I told her I wasn’t sure but she looked so excited that I said yes, she was ecstatic.I just wanted to make her happy. We went through the rules (tell your partner everything, always come home to sleep, never bring a partner home.) For the first 3 months I didn’t do anything/ didn’t meet anyone. On the other side my wife came every week with a new story, every time she told me what she had done, a part of me wanted to die. 9 months ago I went on a trip with my friends and they invited this guy let’s call him Jake (26m). I had never met Jake before. We talked on the trip, and after the trip we started hanging out. One day he told me he was gay and for some reason I got excited about it and I started thinking about him a lot and I started having feelings for him. I didn’t know if I was gay or bi, I had never felt anything like that for a man. One day we went out to a bar and got a bit drunk so we went to his apartment, he looked so beautiful,he is the most beautiful person I have met, and I just kissed him, he stopped me and said I was drunk, but I told him everything, how I feel about him, and we ended having sex, it was amazing, I can remember as if it was yesterday. I felt really guilty but I didn’t regret it and I still don’t. I started seeing him. My wife started to notice that I was less around the house and we had less and less sex btw I didn’t enjoy it anymore, I always used the excuse that I was with my friends, that I have to much work. She said she wanted to close our marriage that we were drifting apart and that she didn’t need anyone else than me.I agreed but I really wasn’t affected with what she did. I think she did it because she was sensing something was going on.Yesterday my friend group (including Jake) went out. They started asking what was I planning for my wedding anniversary and I could see Jake was uncomfortable with it and I tried to change the subject, we didn’t talk that much that day. For the next few days he was a bit distant, and I asked him about it and he said he hates the fact that he’s hurting someone that doesn’t deserve it, he hates that he loves someone who isn’t his. I knew he felt uncomfortable by the fact I’m married. I knew he felt guilty. I hate the fact that he’s feeling this way because of my fault. I want to leave my wife. I know she doesn’t deserve it but she deserves someone who can love her and make her happy.I love him.He’s the love of my life.He’s the sweetest person I have ever met."

xuzwy7_3135,xuzwy7,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"My boyfriend and I have been together steadily for almost a year now. I bought a place out of state in July where he, my children (8yo and 5 yo) and I all live now. My husband passed away unexpectedly two and a half years ago when my boys were only 6 and 3.
 I had my late husbands urn on a shelf in my living room of my previous home where my children could go and talk to him, write him notes, or give him flowers. 
It never bothered my boyfriend then and that is something I loved about him, he let us process our grief in the way we needed to. Now, since we moved into our new home he has been expressing to me how he feels uncomfortable for any photos I have in the common space, especially ones that have myself and my late husband together in as well as things such as photo books I’ve made for my boys. I’ve moved all of the photos to my boys room where there are no longer any photos of all four of us, just my late husband and the boys.
Now my boyfriend is expressing to me how he feels uncomfortable with my late husbands urn in our common space and wants me to move them to my children’s room. He says that if the remains are a memory for them then they should be in their room. This just made me feel very emotional. I do not want to move all things of my late husband into my children’s room I would like to have a space where we can remember him openly and I don’t have to feel guilty for doing so.. so am I the asshole for not taking my boyfriends feelings into consideration on this sensitive subject?


I would like to add that a year before my husband passed, he was living out of the home and not with my children and I. He struggled with addiction since he was young and after his best friend who was like a brother passed he relapsed so I needed to remove my children from the situation. I’m not defending his behavior but he wasn’t a bad person. He was just hurting from many things and didn’t know what to do with that pain other then numb himself out, after doing much therapy I’ve realized this. To me this doesn’t make a difference on the situation, he was still the father of my children and the last few months of his life he went through rehab and was in sober living where he was able to rebuild a relationship with the boys.
He was supposed to move in after completing treatment but we lost him before he could do so."

Yesterday night, my baby (1yr old) was crying a lot, he had been crying non-stop for almost half-an-hour. He cries at times without a reason, one would have to act like a clown constantly in order to make him stop crying. And I was already very tired, fed up, and restless. And wanted a few minutes rest. My husband was not home that time.

So I approached my brother-in-law so he could play with my baby for some time. But, he (B-I-L) was playing Call of Duty that time and requested me to come after 20 minutes. I was already so tired and restless, and the baby would not stop crying. So I went back to my room and made my baby sleep after he continued crying for another 15 mins.

This morning, my Br-in-Law was playing with my baby. My baby was not crying this time. And I said to him to not play with my baby (in a little loud tone) (because he wasn’t there for him last night when he was constantly crying). 

AITA for saying that to my Br-in-law?"

xveavn_3150,xveavn,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (f 17) am going to be in my (f 22) wedding next year. my sister made me her maid of honor and at first i was ecstatic. Now not so much. It all started when she first asked me to be in her wedding, she asked me to bind my breasts so i wouldnt “outshine her”. i thought this was a joke at first and laughed. for context, im a 28 G cup, 5’2, blonde hair, green eyes, about 110lbs, and have a hour glass shape measurements. This is not to brag at all so please do not think that. My sister is 5’1 brown hair, brown eyes, small breasted, and about 160 lbs. I personally think my sister is gorgeous and her fiancé believes so as well, along with all my friends. A week later we go dress shopping for her, my mom is dressed up and so is my sister before we leave. I ask if i’m supposed to wear something more formal and my sister snaps and says “no the attention is supposed to be on me, u keep trying to steal my spot light” i explain that that’s not the case and i wanted to make sure i was following the dress code to the shop. we get to the shop, and everyone there is wearing very nice clothing. I’m wearing ripped jeans and a hoodie. I felt uncomfortable because i was getting judgmental stares from customers and employees. I didn’t say anything and instead helped to pick a dress for my sister. i didn’t know what her dress size was so i asked, she said “ur just trying to make me feel bad about myself because i’m not skinny like you. at least i have meat on my bones” i was taken aback and didn’t say anything. i went to where my sister and mother were picking out dresses and picked some from the size rack she was using. I picked beautiful dresses that were in her price range for her. she picked the dress i found for her. when we got home she wanted to look online for bridesmaids dresses. we were looking and whenever i said i liked a dress it was always a no and “ur trying to steal my spotlight. u have huge boobs and it’s honestly gross to see them with ur body. ur not proportionate.” and honestly i was pretty hurt by this comment. she found one she liked and it was a mother of the bride dress. it was extremely old lady ish and not something i would ever wear. she picked dresses for her other bridesmaids that were gorgeous and i loved them. she then told me she really wanted me to bind myself so i wouldn’t look so large busted. I was sick of the comments and said “i’m tired of the comments about my body. if ur that insecure get implants and workout at a gym. i’d rather not go to a wedding like urs if this is how you’ll treat me.” my mom told me i was in the wrong and that my sister was trying to compliment me. my dad said that my sister was being rude but my response was cruel. i have been recovering from an eating disorder and am finally healthy looking. i’ve worked hard for my body and felt like i looked good. my sisters comments made me feel triggered and hurt. so aita?"

They are both slobs I know kids are messy I try my best to find corrective action instead of corporal punishments. My son and daughter do things they know better than to do at their age especially when my mother is the one watching them while I work. They are not receptive to her at all because of her over dramatic responses to things I never was receptive to her as a child either.

My son is very bad about throwing things or tossing things today makes the 3rd week he has wasted a whole pack of toilet paper by throwing it around the bathroom and it falling into the toilet bowl. Today I hear my mother going off downstairs at my son. I call him up to my office and ask him what happened. He explains he accidentally threw our only roll of TP around the bathroom and it accidentally fell in the toilet again. Instead of raising my voice or getting angry I simply stated that we have already discussed that he should not do this and he is old enough to know better than to do such careless acts and reminded him he is too old to be told not to be so wasteful or careless. I took his tablet took his television privileges away and told him he is going to work on house chores until I feel he has worked long enough to afford what it costs to buy our household toilet paper. That way the next time he uses the restroom he knows he had to work and pay for that and will think twice before being so careless with our essential household items. He's crying right now and is acting like I chained him to a radiator and starved him. My mother suddenly changed her tone and is telling me I am being ""cruel"" for making him do chores to such a degree that he cannot handle it. I told him to clean the kitchen and do the dishes that's it. That should take him a decent amount of time to earn a pack of toilet paper that he will use his allowance to purchase. It's a teaching moment in my opinion. It sends a more direct message than an ass whoopin ever would. I see nothing wrong with this. My mom thinks it's too much though and says it's cruel and unusual for a boy his age. But I don't feel that way at all so AITAH?"

The problem is my sister is still very scared of Covid so we could only see the baby through her patio door, she wouldn’t even open a bit on the other side so we could hear eachother talk. I understood then cause he didn’t get his first vaccines.  I then had my daughter and she never asked to come see her (i also have a patio door in the back). About a month ago she invited us outside with my mom and brother, we had to wear N95 masks, but we were able to hold the baby, which was great and i also brought my daughter. While we were there she asked my husband if we were gonna vaccinate our child against covid when she’s 6 months, my husband said hell no. My sister then said it was really important and we really should, my husband just changed subjet cause he didn’t wanna argue with her. Last week, i asked her if she was coming to my daughter’s baptism in November and she said no unless people wear masks. I said well there is no mandate so obviously no one will wear one, but she could wear one herself if she wanted to, she still said no. This week my mom went to see her and her son and i saw the video my sister sent us in our group chat, my mom was waving from the patio door closed, so now its back to that and no one is allowed to hold her son anymore or to be in contact with her unless it’s this way. I wrote (and this is prob where i might be the ah) : oh what happened Covid came back in your backyard?! She then wrote me a bible and told me that it was my problem if i wanted my daughter to catch covid and get sick. That’s when i told myself Ok, this Covid thing will always scare her and we can’t do anything about it, I’m done trying to reason with her. So i just blocked her from everywhere. I get that she can do wtv she wants with her son but one day we can see him and the next its back to the patio door again. My mom won’t be able to hold him again the whole winter because its ‘’covid season’’. Its pretty sad cause my daughter will never be close to her only cousin. I told my mom she can contact me through her when she starts therapy, cause she truly need it. So am i the ah for blocking her and moving on?! Thanks!"

I had told a couple of close family about my engagement &amp; they had planed out a surprized for me after I announced it to everyone. After everyone arrived, I got there attention to announce the engagement. It went so well stringers went off, everyone congratulated us.

Is was so nice until my sister's now fiancee got everyone's attention for what I thought was going to be a congratulations thing (he likes to be the center of attention so I was not surprised). Instead of a congrats speech, he proposed to sister. She of course said yes &amp; got congratulations from people but not as exciting as when I announced my engagement only 30 minutes prior.

So one of the surprises was a cake that had congratulations me &amp; partner with a couple of ring in back ground.y sister wanted the names removed off the cake sence there was now 2 newly engaged couples &amp; we both should be celebrated. Granted to say as no ne expected 2 engagements (let alone most didn't expect 1) so they where not very prepared for this. Several people seem to have think that she tryed to steal my my engagement announcement but I said that she didn't know he was going to do that &amp; that this wasn't even a planed even so it wasn't like they didn't plan it purposely to mach.

I keep geting told that it was rude of me have all the attention at that get together &amp; I should not have announced it so soon in the day because they apparently been planing that engagement for 2 months (not to my or anyone else at the get together knowledge only her friends group knew).

AITA for not waiting to announce my engagement at the get together &amp; taking the light my sister engagement had. I do fill bad that she didn't get the same excitment as I did &amp; taking light away from what should have been a great time for them.

3 days later, ex-bf's boss contacts me and tells me that he spoke to management. ""We can't keep someone here, knowing what you've shown us. We're firing him and telling other branches not to accept any applications from him. Thank you for coming forward."" (This is me cutting down the email so you can understand.)

My ex complained to his friends about being fired.

Am I the asshole for exposing my ex's shitty behaviour to his boss?"

originally she planned to move to me because that's what would be easiest. however she eventually admitted she didn't wanna move here and she didn't wanna get married. well after a bunch of talking she admitted that the reason she doesn't want to move here is because of my ex/kids mother (bm).

I did not however realize her hatred and resentment was so extreme that it overshadowed all her feelings for me. she would honestly rather hate my bm than be with me. 
now this is where I may be the asshole.

so am I the asshole for hoping she would get past her grudge and defending my ex. or is my ex the asshole for letting her hatred overshadow her love?

ETA: Most the issues between the 3 of us occurred over a year and a half ago and since then my bm has actually been very supportive of the relationship. The only one still holding a grudge is my ex despite the fact that my bm has more then enough reason to hold a grudge too.

xwn5of_3191,xwn5of,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (30F) live on my own and have no pets of my own. My parents frequently go on holiday and for the past 5 years I have looked after their 3 cats whilst they travel. When I look after the cats, it involves me moving into their house for the duration of their holiday so I am there to feed the cats and keep them company. 
I work full time and their house is further away from my work and my out of work hobbies, but even though it is an inconvenience, I’ve always been happy to help out because I love the cats. At this point I would also like to mention I have a stepsister (27F) who lives closer, but who has never helped or been asked to help with the care of the cats. 

This year my parents got a Puppy, and this puppy changed the whole dynamic. Suddenly stepsister wanted to help during holidays. Insisting she will take the dog for the 2 weeks at her house and I continue care of the cats at my Dads. This wouldn’t have been a problem, except during this time we shared pet sitting duties, she began dictating times and days I would need to have the dog too so she could go out partying or on a date, but if I asked her to look in on the cats because I was working late, there was always an excuse followed by a rude remark. 
I will also mention that she doesn’t dislike the cats at all - 2 of them are older and were part of the family household whilst she lived there years prior. And she frequently describes one of them as her “baby boy” 

It has been during this year I started to notice that my parents no longer asked me if I am free to petsit too. Instead they assume I will just be available and book trips before asking me. They have stopped leaving any food or even milk for a coffee, instead they run all the groceries down before they leave and often only out of date stuff is left behind. 

I caught covid a couple days before they returned from their last 2 week trip, meaning my Stepsister was forced to care for the cats for a short time. I let my parents know that was the case but got no reply.
On my parents return from their holiday, I didn’t hear from them again, no texts or calls. They didn’t ask if I was feeling better, no thank yous for the pet sitting either. Just Radio silence. 
And because I am stubborn and was annoyed over this. I gave them no communication either.

It was maybe 3 days after they returned I noticed a Snapchat story from my stepsister, a selfie in her kitchen and behind her on the counter was a PILE of obviously Greek snacks. My parents had clearly purchased her a thank you gifts for caring for the dog. 

Just over a week after they returned from holiday, I finally get a text from my dad. No “thank yous”, no “how are you feeling”, just a text letting me know they were going away for a long camping weekend and I was needed to look after the cats again, but the dog would be going away with them. 

So I refused. I made up a bullshit excuse and said no. Forcing them to find alternative arrangements. This is the first time I have ever refused. 
 
Another month passes, no communication in between, and I am again told I am needed for cat sitting after they booked a trip for in 2 days time, and not to worry, stepsister will have the dog again. 

So I refused.. I told my Dad he was unfair expecting me to drop everything without asking if I am free first. That I felt under appreciated and resented the fact they don’t even thank me for my time either. Not to mention the gifts stepsister was showered with for looking after the dog for the first time whilst I got nothing.

He got angry and said I was being deliberately awkward and he felt I was attacking him and my stepmum. Cat sitting has never been a problem for me before and it’s not a strenuous task so he doesn’t understand why I am looking for problems that don’t exist and attention seeking. He also said I lived in his house using his energy and water free of charge whilst looking after the cats, whilst my stepsister had the dog at her house and was more difficult to care for, so I have my own set of “perks”

I still refused to look after the cats, even though I wasn’t busy, which meant they had to make very last minute adjustments to their holiday plans. My parents and stepsister are now not talking to me and say I was deliberately trying to ruin their holiday..

So, AITA?"

I (25 f) have always had a strained relationship with my stepdad (55 m) , and he made it worse when he openly addmitted to having an affair with his cousin. 
During the time he cheated my mother (49 f)
Was grieving my brother who was killed in 2015.
(No I won't go into detail about his death)
So my entire family was shook when SD admitted and carried on the affair for 2 more years. He kept telling Ma hebloved her and would stop this relationship,  as well as telling his cousin the same thing.
Well finally he dropped contact with cousin and my mother forgave him (im hoping its because he'll die sooner and get life insurance)
Buut ive openly told my mother indont care if she forgave him, or if she wants to be with him. I do not want to have contact or a relationship with him anymore and yet she still forces it upon me. (For examply my son (6 m) is staying with themnfor a night, and he will do the drop off next day) so would i be the ahole for not letting my son visit for the night?

My Dad is a genuine POS and cheated on my mother for years with his mistress, now wife, who was my baby sitter when I was a kid. Everyone knew about it, except the kids and my mother. I loved my babysitter cause she was so fun and nice to me and she seemed to bring out a side in him that made him more fun too. 
Turns out they were fucking when my siblings and I were taking naps, while in the same house. 

He left my mother for her after about 3 years of fucking the babysitter because he had finally “found his soulmate”. I was there for this fight and the shit he told my mother was so horrible I remember being so hurt for her and I was like 9 years old. He told her that she was “too old” and “let herself go” and that he deserved a partner that he could be proud of. My mother was 35 and ,yes, she couldn’t go to the gym for like 2 hours everyday because she was working full time and my Dad kept knocking her up every 2 years so she had me and my 3 younger siblings to look after. But she was fucking beautiful and kind and loved this asshole with every thing she had.

My babysitter is 10 years younger than my mother and was genuinely stunning when she was that age. I remember being enamored with her because I thought she looked like a Disney princess. So I guess that’s what really mattered to him.

The confession and subsequent divorce sent my mother into a deep depression which led to alcoholism which eventually killed her 3 years ago.

I 100% blame my father for this and he knows it. When I was a teenager and I was more aware of what actually happened and not the stupid “Mommy and Daddy just fell out of love” bullshit he tried so hard to push. I made it extremely aware to him how I felt about their relationship and how shitty of a person I thought he was. To his credit he was a much better husband to the babysitter than he was to my mom. He genuinely seemed like he loved her. Would shower her with gifts and attention. Made an effort to be present and affectionate to her. He seemed happy with her. Extremely so.

Don’t have much of a relationship with Dad these days because of the whole destroying my family and mother for his dick thing. But my siblings do, and my little sister called me and let me know that last night Dad called her sobbing. Apparently the babysitter has been having an affair with their landscaper and she’s leaving my Dad for him. 

I laughed so hard. Just fucking gleefully laughing at the fact that FINALLY this man gets a taste of his own medicine. Apparently my Dad is just destroyed by this. He’s so heartbroken and distraught; my sister said he could barely speak on the phone to her.

I hope he dies miserable and alone. And I’m thinking about writing him a letter that says exactly that. But then again he might be in enough pain that it won’t matter what I say to him, he already knows I loathe him with ever fiber of my being. My Wife let me know it would sink me down to his level and that’s the last thing I want."

xxmpku_3224,xxmpku,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"TL:DR- My new neighbor called the cops on me and I may have gotten CPS called on her.

I (23F) graduated from college in May of this year with a Bachelor of Accounting. After searching for a job all throughout the summer, I finally landed a job in California. For reference, I'm from Georgia. I am an assistant bank examiner, basically, I travel to banks and make sure they are running their business properly and legally.

Now the company helped with my moving expenses and put me in a nice house in one of the suburbs of Cali. It was a simple one-story, two-bedroom, and one-bath house but it did have a fenced yard so I planned on getting a dog. However before I landed this job, I was a broke graduate living in a one-bedroom apartment so I didn't have much stuff with me except my two suitcases of clothes, shoes, and memorabilia that my mom let me have from her house. My company gave me a set amount for the moving cost and the rest wasn't enough to furnish the house so I kept it and used it to get a blow-up mattress, a car rental, and one of those fake security camera props.

Now the situation. The first two weeks in California were hectic trying to get into the grove of not only the new job but a whole new state. So I would leave early in the morning and would get back later in the day, gone from about 8 am to 7 or 8 pm. I would get groceries while I was out and would get into the house through the garage door. I didn't really talk to my neighbors since I am a female by myself in an unfamiliar state and wanted to wait until I got comfortable.

After the first two weeks, I received my first check and realized I was finally making ""big girl money"". After putting most of it away for billing and a down payment on a car, I have a good bit left and decided to go shopping for furniture tomorrow (was gonna wait a few months for the dogs). So I waited for the weekend and went shopping for furniture. I got a good bit done and I am having most of it shipped to my house so they can set up the bedframe and other stuff. I also started getting mail to the new house, mainly junk mail, and decided to check it when I get home. This would be one of the very few times I would get home before it got dark, like 4pm. I parked my car at the end of the driveway and started looking through the mail when I notice a woman walking up to me. I was on the sidewalk in front of the mailbox so I just moved over thinking she was just walking by. As you may have guessed, she stopped right beside me and asked what am I doing. Like I said before, I did not speak to my neighbors and the question took me off guard since I did not know this lady, so I just stayed silent and stared for a few seconds. She asked again and this time I waved the letters in my hand before saying ""checking my mail"". Im gonna spare the details and avoid giving the full conversation and just get to the point. She did not believe I lived at my house because she ""knew the people who lived there"" and had never seen me before. I told her I moved here recently for my job and tried to end it there bc while I understand neighborly concerns, I feel like she should have tried calling these ""neighbors"" if she really knew them. I didn't even know where that lady came from or if she was the next-door neighbor. She needed up threatening to call the police since this is a nice neighborhood unless I prove to her I lived there, and I told her to call them and tried to go inside the house but she grabbed my arm and stopped me. She did immediately let me go and I still went into my house by unlocking the door. 

The police arrived and she told him what happened. He spoke me to and I obviously proved I lived here, from my keys to the mail with my name on it. He went back to her and she became belligerent and told him that I don't live here. By now this lady has been outside my house for around an hour and a half. However, after a while of talking (more like quietly yelling) to the officer, she mentioned she saw me going through her neighbor's mail(my mail) and had to put her baby down to investigate because it was only her and her baby, and she was nervous. My ear shoot to this and I said to her, "" so you left your baby in your house for almost two hours alone"". She dumbly attempted to do it and say she always leaves her kid alone and that she's fine. 

As a mandatory reporter, the officer(who has stopped listening to her and was just standing there) had to make a note of this and said he will be reporting it. The woman began to backtrack and say she didn't mean it. She then looked at me and said it is my fault if they call cps and stormed off. 

It was been a few days and I don't know if CPS ever came to that lady's house and I haven't seen her since. I had told my mom and stepdad about the situation, they are on my side but my stepdad said she probably only said what she said for sympathy and they might actually take her child away. So AITA?"

He got into an accident earlier this year and lost his old job, he has a job now but our household income is now almost HALF what it used to be and now we need food stamps just to get us by. A lot of the meals he insults are foods the kids love, like beef and gravy on pasta or turkey joes. Or they're comfort foods from when I was a kid like macaroni with broccoli and ham. No one else complains, just him. AITAH if I just don't make him any and tell him to figure it out for himself since all he wants to do is complain but not help come up with other meal ideas?"
xydw5h_3250,xydw5h,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So, over the past 15 years I have lent money, paid for bills and even helped my sister get a car. She has never once paid me back for anything.  If I were to total everything upnot would be at least 10 grand.  A month ago, she asked me for $150 I lent it to her because she said her car got broken into and they stole the new battery she bought and other supplies.   When I asked of she had the miney to pay me back, she said she was in between paychecks and used all the money in bills.   Now today she said she need $350 to help pay for new brakes.  She wrangled my brother in to help pay for the other half that would total around 950 all together.  

Ok, so some more current backstory...her 17 year old daughter (my niece) was just diagnosed with non-hodgekins lymphoma.   She had been in the hospital for over a month now, sedated and going through many surgeries.  My sister is taking time off of work and had not received a disability check or whatever is going to help her during this time.  

Now I know it's just money, and in the end it should not matter but I don't want her to keep thinking I'm her piggy bank and she can just borrow and not pay back.  Just because I'm her sister doesn't make ot any different for borrowing from anyone else.   It makes me feel used and I work hard for my money.

AiTAH for not helping with everything that's going on.  I don't want to look like the bad , selfish sister who wouldn't help when her kid is in the hospital.   It's just the same all the time,  I can't trust her anymore."
xyimp4_3255,xyimp4,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"WIBTA if I asked my brother to break up with his girlfriend? (Possible TW)

I (14f) am quite concerned for my oldest brother (21). Last year my brother had switched to a college a few states away, which he has now dropped out of and created his own business. While attending college my brother met his girlfriend (21) who we’ll call Alexis. 

The first time I had personally met her was when she came up for Thanksgiving last year. She was kinda pretty and seemed nice at first. The second day they were there, my brother and father went on a two day hunting trip, so it was just me and my mother with Alexis.

The first red flag was when I had gotten a text from my brother’s ex girlfriend who was very sweet, she was just inviting me to a small girls event at her church. I had asked my mother what to say to her, which happened to be in front of Alexis. Then the next day I was just looking through old pictures and videos when I came across a funny video of that same ex girlfriend’s brother from Halloween, I had showed her the video and she laughed. 

Later that night when my brother got home, she had apparently told him that I was practically saying, “that she will never be as good as my brother ex girlfriend because I keep bring her up,” but the text had nothing to do about her dating my brother, and the video was her brother who also happens to go to the same school as me.

She had also came down for Christmas, where multiple things had happened. One of the worst being where my brother had plans to go up to visit our grandparents and have our grandfather help him paint the breaks on his car. I had decided to go up with him. Alexis is obsessed with dogs, she has two puppies, (at the time) a 8 month old golden retriever, and a 1 year old black lab. She had originally brought them at Thanksgiving which was really chaotic so she wasn’t allowed to bring the this time. She ended up saying to my brother that she didn’t want to go, and started begging my brother if we could go to a breeder just to SEE the puppies. This certain breeder she wanted to go see was an hour drive one way. My brother kept saying no, and she kept begging like a 5 year old saying, “Please, please, please, pleaseee.” 

The thing that had set off major red flags, is the most recent encounter. My brother and Alexis decided they’d move in together and they had bought a house, mind you they haven’t even been together for a full year. After they had moved in me and my parents had gone down for a day and a half to help finalize them moving in. Things like buying them a dryer, outdoor furniture, stuff like that. 

Later in the day, she said she was going to go pick up laundry at her friends house while we ran a few more errands. While we were out, she started texting my brother threatening to break up. She said she was going to pick up some stuff at the house and stay at her friend’s place. My brother was concerned that she might try and take his dog with her that she had gotten him for Valentine’s Day, he ended up texting his roommate to make sure she didn’t take him. When we got back to the house, my brother left to go confront her, leaving me and my parents alone at his house while he was chasing her. When we looked to see what she took with her, all she took was her two dogs, not a toothbrush, nothing else.

He called my mom later, saying he was on his way back and that Alexis was in her car following him home. Apparently he found her in the bathtub with a knife saying, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” So either, A. She was doing all that to get his attention and take him away from us, which she has done other things like this to take him away. Or B. She’s not mentally stable enough to be in a relationship. After they got home within an hour she was smiling and sitting on his lap again.

There have been many, many more occasions that set off red flags. But when my parents have brought this to his attention, he always tries to justify it by saying it’s because of her abusive past. 

So, would I be the asshole if I were to ask my brother to open his eyes and break up with her?






Update:

Earlier tonight she ended up showing her true colors to my brother.

She went out drinking with her friends earlier and when my brother came home she kept cursing at him saying things like, “I’m against abortions, but if I was pregnant with your child I’d get one because why would anyone want someone like you” and things along those lines. 

She also ended up accusing me of say I hate my parents because they’re homophobic and how “She’s the prettiest person I’ve ever seen, and I hope I meet someone just like her,” which I have never said any of the sorts other, yes than I am gay. 

She has also threatened to call the police on him (because her uncle is the chief of police in their city) and will get his dog taken away and blah, blah, blah.

He is currently sitting in his car with his dog trying to figure out where he’s going to stay tonight because he’s afraid to go home and he can’t take his dog into a hotel, and he has work in the morning."

I know that it is illegal and trust me I haven’t done it since, lesson learned.

xzeqv1_3301,xzeqv1,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"TLDR: husband made a grooming comment and abuse joke in front of mother in law who said “ she isn’t deserving of my son” because I’m “ tainted” in the eyes of God. 


I’ve (24F) known my husband (25M) since we were in middle school and I’ve always thought we happy together and in love, you know typical stuff. I’ve always been open about my past and childhood. Part of that was being severely abused by my biological parents and grandmother. I was raised by my grandfather but often my mother or grandmother would watch me while he went to work. My mother was heavily addicted to drugs that she would often use me in any way she could to get money. My father was violent and sometimes crashed with my grandmother ( her and my grandfather were divorced) so in order to keep me from doing things as kids do she would drug me using her medication and if that didn’t work I’d be threatened with severe beatings or actually beaten unconscious. I could never tell anyone about the abuse since I was terrified of what they would do to me and my grandpa. Once I was finally old enough  (14) I was able to make the choice to have zero contact with any of them without the fear.  My grandpa was a good man but he wasn’t the type to show emotion or comfort but the type to “ hide it and deal with it. If not don’t ever tell a soul” so i kept all the trauma to myself. I tried therapy but it didn’t help. Once I started dating my husband I felt all the love and attention I was neglected that I never had as a little girl so I was happy. He never pushed me and always made sure I was comfortable so I tried my best to never be a pain or a burden. 

Yesterday afternoon his mother invited us over for lunch. Usually I do ok with his mother but I’ve been on low contact with her after she threw a passive aggressive fit at me for going on a walk by myself while we were on a family vacation. Well we were talking about a video game where I was talking about how a fatherly character was an asshole for trusting a rat over his own son where my husband laughs and says “ Are you upset about it because another father figure betrayed you?”. I’m all for dark humor and I make plenty of them to cope with trauma but for some reason his comment stung a lot more than I felt it should, especially given I like dark humor.  I kept it together and moved on. Not too long later his mom made a comment about how long we’ve been together and that we’ll make a cute family. ( I can’t have children thanks to bio parents  and husband knows and is ok with it. Not like we can’t adopt ). I smiled and kinda cuddled into him feeling a little socially drained and dozed off a bit still listening. 

“ Well she was easy to train and I’m happy I make her happy” husband says with a laugh almost. 

His mom kinda looks at him weird and asks what he means to which he made he says that I had daddy issues and that he had to basically groom me. 

She proceeds to ask what he means and he goes into the abuse ( all of it not just parts ).

I’ve never told anyone about what I went through because it’s not how I was raised and I didn’t feel comfortable speaking up about it. 

At that point I’m already wide awake and shaking. I felt my heart in my throat and it was taking everything in me not to break down. ( pa didn’t raise a cry baby as he would say ) 

She automatically asks if I’ve been saved by God and a bunch of other bullshit, asking about the abuse and how far it went. So I speak up and tell her that I’m not religious and that I’m perfectly fine. 

At this point I’m getting up and ready to leave to either eat my feelings at Dunkin’ Donuts or go anywhere to just get away.  

Mother in law gives me a glare and tells my husband that Im probably not the right wife since I’ve been tainted in the eyes of God.

 But Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and that’s exactly what I was feeling at that moment. 

Turning around I raised my voice and yelled at  both they had no right to speak of me in the manner they had and that I’m not some damned bitch he could ever tame. I might have trauma and I might be naive but I sure as hell won’t be spoken down to. 
When I reached the door I turned back and said, “Parents tried to raise me as a bitch but they didn’t raise me at all” 

Now I’m getting calls and message from husband begging for forgiveness and apologizing for what he said but I’m scared to talk to him because his grooming comment has me doubting everything about my feelings for him and our marriage. I have a therapy session scheduled next week to hopefully figure this mess out but I just needed to get this off my chest but now I’m feeling guilty and that I might’ve overreacted but I can’t tell if that’s “me” or the victim of me."

I have a therapy session scheduled next week to hopefully figure this mess out but I just needed to get this off my chest but now I’m feeling guilty and that I might’ve overreacted but I can’t tell if that’s “me” or the victim of me."

I (18f) live with my brothers and my mum. We have a few consoles in our home which have been in our living room. Last year my youngest brother had taken the Xbox one to his room as he was the only one to play on it which was fine as all my games were on the ps4. However the ps4 had been over heating a lot since the beginning of the year resulting to me being kicked out of my games . I brought up the issue to my oldest brother and he kept saying he will fix it but it’s been months now ( I would have fixed it myself but no one told me how when I asked).
However recently I have heard him playing his games so I went to go see if he had fix the problem but surprisingly (not really Kinda saw it coming) the ps4 in now no longer in the living room but upstairs in his. 
I’ve been saving for the ps5 for a while so I was just wondering WIBTA if I brought it but kept it under lock and key in my room just for me to play on ?"

Not just because of the work, the people you encounter, the management, but also the co-workers you have to deal with. On this particular morning I was running a bit late and was rushing to check in. The dispatch is located in a long corridor that connects the driver's parking lot to the buses with the lounge in-between. As I entered the corridor, I noticed two coworkers walking and one of the complaining loudly. I ignored them because it was none of my business and again, I was late. As I made it to the door which was locked, a little voice told me to wait and hold the door for them. As they came around the corner and saw me holding the door for them, she twisted her head and said loudly with an attitude, ""What?!? You don't think I can get the door for myself!"" I took a fraction of a second to mull over her nastiness and then slammed the door in her face. I turned and stared to walk away and heard from the other side her scream, ""Are you serious?!?""

I checked in and started filling out my paperwork for the day. She made it threw the door and made her way over to me saying, ""I bet you think that was really funny"" I turned and said, ""No lady, I think it was sad. I took time out of my day to hold that door for you and instead of saying ""thank you!"", you said ""f-you! I'll do it myself!"" Well I let you do it yourself, are you happy?"" 

So... aita?"

I 18F have been dating my boyfriend 27M for over a year now, when we started talking i knew he has slept with 9-10 women (he couldn’t remember how many). I also knew he was quite the party guy and had OD’d in the past. It didn’t ever bother me though because it was when he was a teenager. I’m more of a reserved quiet person, focused on school and had a small group of friends. So he was my first time, but we got into an argument because of nonsense. He told me his ex was better than me. As a person and in bed, This shook me because his ex had cheated on him and was a decade ago. I felt betrayed as he was my first time, He also said disturbing things like my #### was good but the putrid thing attached ( the rest of me ) wasn’t worth it. “ a waste of skin “ and so on. After that i noticed how on his facebook he had love confessions to her to this day and when i talked to him about it he just privated his account instead of removing it. I can’t bare to look at him without feeling disgusted and voilated. She is now married and with kids but he has no problem telling me how much better she is and how much his mom liked her because she was “mature” unlike me. He also casually calls me braindead amongst other things and what not even though i have a 99.75 atar and got into medicine.

This past spring her boyfriend got her caught up into drugs and she relapsed. She overdosed I called 911 and her being on probation she had violated her terms and conditions. They sent a warrant for her arrest out. She spent two weeks in jail and was sentenced to 6 Months house arrest. I was working two jobs to make ends meet during this time trying to keep everything afloat. Now I pay rent utilities and help pay her ankle bracelet fees. It's too much. She always treats me like I am completely responsible for her financially and each month gets worse she helps less and less financially. I've been busting my ass pulling overtime to make sure I can give my kids a nice birthday. Our rent is running just a few days late this month I did the math including her portion of finances and figured I would be able to get both my children a really nice gift this year and still make my half of the rent. Well here we are the day to pay the landlord and my mom has no money at all. She gets $876 monthly in disability. It's only been 5 days and she's broke. I was so hurt and so pissed that she has completely left me financially responsible for all of us. I won't be able to give my kids the birthday they deserve and unfortunately have to return their gifts to get by this month. I found a 1 bedroom for rent and called about it this morning behind her back. I'm packing and leaving November first and leaving her to figure it out on her own or ask my older sister for mercy. Apart of me feels like I'm not being fair but another part of me is exhausted and utterly depressed from having to take care of my mom....AITAH?

y0xty6_3362,y0xty6,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Hello! This happened last Friday and I feel horrible. I really do think I’m in the wrong here, so does my mom, but I really wanted a 3rd opinion.

I(F16) am a sophomore in highschool. I take IB courses, so advanced maths, science, etc. I’m a bigger girl, 5’10, and wear baggy clothes. I should note that I powerlift, my biggest deadlift being 120kg. Combined with the baggy clothes, I often appear more chubby than I am. 

This boy, J(M16) has been picking on me since middle school. I am openly bisexual,  and he seems to think that is funny. He calls me slurs in the halls, but normally behind my back. Whenever I catch him doing it I call him out, and I don’t hear from him for a day until it continues. Sometimes he will even prank call me, but he’s stopped doing that ever since I signed him up for multiple inappropriate sites.

The big issue started on Wednesday, when J got up in my face. Of course he’d never done this before, and I’m assuming he did it to “impress” his friends. My friends looked at him like he was crazy, and I asked him what he was doing and laughed. Embarrassed, he insulted me and called me fat. He’d never brought weight into our little showdowns, so I was surprised. He must’ve noticed, because he kept going. I just let him have it and walked away.

The next day I had no classes with J, but at lunch the slander continued. “You probably don’t need that,” He snickered behind my back where I was sitting. J treated his harassment like some kind of disney highschool bully. It was ridiculous. Me and my friends ignored the comment, shared glances and laughed it off.

Friday is where it got bad. I had been telling my mom about everything, and she told me to go see a principal. We are both very passive people, and don’t enjoy large fights or confrontation which is why I had been enduring this for so long. I arrive to school and before my class I head to the principal. I tell her what has been happening between me and J, and she says something about J being suspended before and how there is nothing to do. She offered to give him a detention, but there was no point.

Fast forward to lunch, me and my friends were going to a grocery store off school property. On the way there we see a big group of boys, a small amount being J and his friends. We lock eyes, but keep to our separate groups. I see him whisper something, and just before we arrive him and his friends split from their own group to walk behind us. 

They basically follow us around the store, and begin stepping on the back of our shoes. I am having no part of this, and turn around. “Can you guys stop doing that?” I say, trying to shut the whole thing down. But they continue. At this point, I am getting mad. They are stepping on me and my friends shoes, which(mine) were new and white. “Are you trying to get in a fight?” I ask J, trying my best to sound intimidating. J is about 6’2 and an average weight, so obviously he has a snarky comment to add about me. “I’m not trying to fight you over any chocolate, don’t get defensive,” he laughed, so did his friends. 

At this point he was a little too close for comfort, so I pushed him away. Notably, I should not have done this. It was in the heat of the moment, and we were in a public store. He pushes me back, and it quickly escalates. He throws the first punch, straight to my jaw, but realistically closer to my ear. I hear my friends ask me if I am okay, before punching him. It wasn’t one of those pity punches either, I really put my body weight into it. Swinging full force I made contact with his nose. My adrenaline quickly wore off, and I asked if he was okay, he pushed me away swearing. I saw bl//d dripping from his hand covered nose, and quickly got out of the store with my friends. 

I guess he didn’t tell anyone, because I haven’t gotten any calls home. Reddit, AITA?"

On Sunday morning the girlfriend and her friends were sitting on the patio under the security camera discussing my grand nephew getting a disbursement from a trust left for him.

This disbursement is intended to pay for ongoing university since he's doing quite well and is going to continue for his masters degree.

She was telling her girlfriends she had a 'boyfriend' on the side and the only reason she was with my grand nephew is she saw the trust paperwork and was going to get a new car, jewelry, cloths etc out of that disbursement. A former foster child was within ear shot when they were talking and tipped me off, so I reviewed the video to confirm.

I told my grand nephew on Monday, and showed him the video, and he's been in a funk and won't talk to his mom (my niece), but told his sister (blabber mouth) and everyone is calling me the A-hole for recording at the party (several notification signs and runs 24/7/365) and for telling my grand nephew and 'hurting' him.

y1noss_3382,y1noss,top-comment,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"  I (17 F) babysit my nephew 5 days a week for 7 hours and don’t get payed for it. It is expected of me as his aunt and as the older person. However, these last few months my nephew (8 M) has begun to act very strange. He has started screaming at me, demanding things from me and hitting or kicking me when he doesn’t get his way. When I asked his mother about this, she admitted she told him that since I wasn’t an adult he doesn’t have to do what I tell him. I told her that doesn’t make sense considering I babysit him alone for multiple hours 5 days a week, and how am I supposed to take care of him if he doesn’t consider me an adult and doesn’t listen to me? 

Well last night was the last straw for me. It was 7 pm at night and my parents had to work late and his mother hadn’t come to pick him up yet. He came up to me demanding that I let him eat the slice of cake that I had bought for myself earlier that day. I told him no and said his mother would be here soon and they would eat dinner together. He threw an absolute FIT at that. Screaming, crying, hitting me. Then, when I told him no again, he ran up to my 3 months old Boston terrier puppy and kicked him as hard as he could. That was when everything went red for me. I grabbed him by his arm and dragged him out of the house and locked him out. His mother finally arrived two minutes later to find him sobbing outside locked out and called me screaming. She asked why I had locked a child out of the house. I told her what happened and she told me that he was “just a kid” and “didn’t know any better”. I told her I could put up with him hitting me, but if he ever touched my puppy again I would slap him. She said I was crazy and abusive for thinking like that and I told her that her son was a psycho and I will not be babysitting him anymore. Both my parents and his mother are furious at me but I don’t feel guilty in the least bit. So AITA?


Edit: Y’all keep telling me I should get a lying job so just info- I do have a paying job. I work 13 hours both Saturday and Sunday"
y1noss_3384,y1noss,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"  I (17 F) babysit my nephew 5 days a week for 7 hours and don’t get payed for it. It is expected of me as his aunt and as the older person. However, these last few months my nephew (8 M) has begun to act very strange. He has started screaming at me, demanding things from me and hitting or kicking me when he doesn’t get his way. When I asked his mother about this, she admitted she told him that since I wasn’t an adult he doesn’t have to do what I tell him. I told her that doesn’t make sense considering I babysit him alone for multiple hours 5 days a week, and how am I supposed to take care of him if he doesn’t consider me an adult and doesn’t listen to me? 

Well last night was the last straw for me. It was 7 pm at night and my parents had to work late and his mother hadn’t come to pick him up yet. He came up to me demanding that I let him eat the slice of cake that I had bought for myself earlier that day. I told him no and said his mother would be here soon and they would eat dinner together. He threw an absolute FIT at that. Screaming, crying, hitting me. Then, when I told him no again, he ran up to my 3 months old Boston terrier puppy and kicked him as hard as he could. That was when everything went red for me. I grabbed him by his arm and dragged him out of the house and locked him out. His mother finally arrived two minutes later to find him sobbing outside locked out and called me screaming. She asked why I had locked a child out of the house. I told her what happened and she told me that he was “just a kid” and “didn’t know any better”. I told her I could put up with him hitting me, but if he ever touched my puppy again I would slap him. She said I was crazy and abusive for thinking like that and I told her that her son was a psycho and I will not be babysitting him anymore.

My husband and I have always had a very close relationship with my brother,  we’ll call him L. He was a permanent fixture at every holiday, birthday and BBQ. Vacations were always spent together as a family. When my children were born he was there for every milestone and sporting event. He never missed a single holiday or BBQ at any of my extended families homes!! 

Several years ago he met a woman who we will call K . As is completely expected they began to spend time together and needed their quality alone time. Here’s were things started to go south….

They called us one day a year into the relationship and wanted to have dinner. We were so excited , my whole family was going. At the dinner k pulls out a photo album and hands everyone a wrapped present. The weekend bf they had decided to get married. K and my brother along with her best friend ( the witness) had a small ceremony. Immediately after the ceremony with a justice of the peace, her family came to celebrate with a photographer. . No one in my family was invited. K explained that it was her special day and she wanted it the way she wanted it. She explained it was a day meant for them and her family lives close by where as we are 2 hours away. She said the only reason they invited them was bc they could easily pop by upon hearing the surprised news. We were hurt but respected their wishes. The gift was a picture of their wedding day.

Soon after k was pregnant. She explained to us that she wanted 3 kids , in 3 years. Being that we lived 2 hours away they would no longer be driving to see us for holidays, birthdays or special events as my brother had other priorities now. It was just to much to make the 2 hour trip. She explained if we wanted to see them we would have to go there. She explained too that she wanted her children to be with her family for the firsts. She set the law and said they would host 1 holiday per year. At this holiday she would also have her entire family! They spend every other holiday with them , we are not invited.  We are not important enough to be given a day. The environment at these events is toxic.   I’ve caught her speaking poorly of my relatives and demeaning them in what she would say is a joking manor. Completely taking away any credibility they may have. She actually joked that she thought my aunt was Autistic. She is not and that is just wrong on so many levels!!! I’m a huge special needs advocate!! 

My husband and I due to the awkwardness chose to not attend after a few years of them hosting. With us not driving to see them, no effort was made to see us. This was when my relationship with my brother I believe died. 

My mom in an effort to fully reconnect invited them on an all expense paid 5 day vacation. She paid for them to have their own Suite in a very posh hotel. Day 1 of the vacation K started a huge fight with my mom at dinner. She was furious my parents would not adhere to her schedule for the theme park. K wanted to go at 7 and be back at hotel  by 3. My mom made a dinner reservation for 4 and this infuriated K. She took her kids and left my mom in tears at the dinner table. My brother stayed behind and tearfully explained this was his life and he just had to accept the behavior. He was very unhappy but had 2 children and one on the way. The rest of the vacation K spent with my brother on their own agenda on my parents dime. Again my mother was devastated. 

After this our relationship with L and K became even more strained. When coronavirus hit she told my mother she was no longer comfortable hosting the “one”holiday……  she would of course post pictures with her family still attending in the home not outside. ( very large family).  When I asked about this My brother claimed that due to living in the same area they were all exposed to the same strain anyway so it made sense. Again my mother was crushed. 

Moms health started failing and she had to have her lung removed. I asked my brother to come see her and he just never showed. He claimed my mother told him it was ok… she did say it was ok after he told her he could not make it. …but that’s your mom and there are no guarantees with this type of serious procedure!! My mom was crushed and devastated yet again. I’m getting so tired of seeing her cry. 

Last weekend, they had a birthday party for their youngest. My parents were invited. They were so happy and excited! They drove 2 hours to see their grand babies. . As they were walking in the door … K explained that she had to ban her step father from the house and she will be doing so to my parents if they did not accept a very big decision that K had made. In shock and not given time to process very unsettling information…My mother started to cry and asked her why she waited to confront her like this in front of her entire family. Why was she not spoken to privately?? That she came for a baby’s party. K literally screamed in her face told her to Fn leave. Huge scene in front of her friends and her family…Once again my mother was blind sided and devastated. My brother stood there and let this horribly set up confrontation go down. This woman loves to put on a show!!! I’m so disappointed in him. * Her parents unbeknownst to her,  called mine to talk and were very apologetic for the events. They 2 are struggling with her. 

The nex day My brother called me to talk ( first time in over a year), I stressed that I was done with ks crazy, explosive and narcissistic behavior. I told him I love him , but as long as they are together I cannot be around the insanity. I explained that at some point , he has to own up to allowing this to go on!! He begrudgingly agreed and we said goodbye!! He’s a grown man!!!!  I’m done!!!!!!! 

AITAH for cutting him off??"

y22xrm_3396,y22xrm,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"I (21M) was recently out with a group of friends, Sarah (22F), her boyfriend Steve (22M) and Beth (21F). Myself, Sarah and Beth are all friends from school and go out quite often.

We went to a sports bar and where having a few drinks and playing pool. We eventually moved over to a table and where all sitting talking.

I told my friends that I was going to head to the bathroom and was going to order more drinks when I got back and asked if anyone wanted anything. This isn’t unusual for us and I thought this time would be like usual. Steve announced he also had to use the bathroom and so did Sarah. Normally Sarah and Beth go together so I said I’d just come straight back to the table to watch the drinks if Sarah and Beth didn’t mind waiting a few minutes. 

However, Beth said she didn’t have to use the bathroom and was happy to watch our drinks as we wouldn’t be long.

Due to this I left to go use the bathroom without waiting on Steve or Sarah. Walking to the bathroom I could hear them laughing behind me and whispering but I thought nothing of it and was more focused on getting to the bathroom then going to grab drinks so Beth wasn’t alone for long.

When I got to the bathroom I thought nothing of the fact I could hear Sarah giggling still, assumed the walls might have just been thin especially since I had decided to use a stall and didn’t see if the door was open. When I came out and was washing my hands I seen Sarah exit a stall and Steve exit the one next to her. I could see a few guys looking confused and I myself felt pretty uncomfortable and was worried.

I am all for using the restroom you feel most comfortable with but when Sarah was standing in the mens room with a dress on and obviously very feminine she looked extremely out of place. I left before they finished washing their hands and headed to get drinks.

When I got back to the table Beth had a strange look on her face. I asked Sarah why she decided to use the mens room and she said she wanted to see what it was like and Steve agreed it was fine for her to do so and it was safe because him and I where there. I tried to explain we could be kicked out or she could’ve been hurt but she laughed it off.

When they left for Steve to go have a cigarette, Beth explained that she came back to the table and found it hilarious that I looked uncomfortable when I noticed her in the restroom and that guys who had left the restroom after them where giving us funny looks.

The next day I brought it up to her, explained that most guys would be uncomfortable in that situation and it’s an invasion of privacy and she shouldn’t do it again. She just laughed this off and said she probably would repeat this as it was funny seeing me getting uncomfortable and didn’t see the big deal.

I explained if she done it again while I was out I wouldn’t be going out with her again as it made me uncomfortable and could result in someone picking a fight.

She called me an asshole for not taking a joke and that I am apparently transphobic for being uncomfortable with someone extremely feminine being in the mens room. I should note she isn’t trans and has never said she was questioning.

So AITAH?"

For context, we live paycheck to paycheck. I work really hard to provide for my girls, but with the current cost of living we are still just scraping by. One day, I received a bonus on my check and wanted to get my girls some toys since it had been a while since I was able to get them anything new. I asked my oldest daughter Rose where she would like to go to pick out some toys. She said that she wanted to go to the Disney store.

When we arrived, both of my girls picked out two princess dolls. Rose picked out Elsa and Rapunzel, then Olivia picked out Ariel and Ana. The dolls totaled out to be around $80 for all four which was fine. As we were leaving, Rose demanded that what she had wasn't enough and wanted me to take her to another store to get more. I tried to explain that I couldn't afford it and that I just bought her new dolls. She was not having it. She started screaming, throwing herself on the floor, and crying.

I finally got them both to the car and left. We drove over to the grocery store because I need to pick up dinner for the night. The whole ride there she was screaming at me and calling me a jerk because I wouldn't get her more. I couldn't understand why she was acting this way. So, I told her if she kept the attitude up, that I was going to give away her new toys. She clearly didn't believe me and screamed the entire time we were in the store. After checking out I finally had enough. I loaded both girls into the car, grabbed Rose's two new dolls and I waited.

After about 8 minutes, and elderly woman came out of the store with a little girl, and I approached her and ask the woman if she would like the dolls. I explained the situation to her, in which, she gladly accepted the dolls, and her granddaughter hugged me and told me thank you.

I got back into the car and Rose was having an absolute breakdown. We made it home and it still continued. I eventually called my best friend for advice, and she told me what I did was over the top and said that Rose was only 6. I understand this, but I refuse to raise either of my girls to believe that throwing a fit will get them what they want, and I wanted to use the experience to teach Rose about being grateful and not entitled. Now I'm starting to regret it because Rose seems heartbroken over it.... So AITA?

Edit: For a little more clarification, the Disney store is about 55 minutes from our home. By the time I gave the dolls away, I was already back in my area so driving back and returning the dolls wasn't a thought.

Edit #2: I wanted to clarify one more thing because I noticed I wrote it in a way that comes off as this being my immediate reaction.

y2fht8_3411,y2fht8,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I (18NB), just graduated high school this past June and since then have picked up 3 jobs. I am still living with my family while I get the money to move out. My dad (55M), who we will call W, and I have always been very close. We go to Baseball games almost every week, and spend a few hours watching Mammoth Club after we’re both done with work. My mother (50F), who we will call H, and I have never gotten along. She is a narcissist and never does anything around the house, despite being a stay at home parent and totally abled bodied. She just sits on the couch and makes my dad and I clean everything.

Anyways, W has been having some hard times at work, he is doing a CFO job while not being compensated correctly. While I realize that is hard because he works long hours and is not being paid well, it becomes my problem. While my dad would never physically hurt me, I do become his emotional punching bag whenever something happens with work or H. I am the only one who he can do this to, so that’s why I become the pin cushion. 

Recently, he and I were on vacation (we went to Disney) and during one of the lines we waited way too long. He was on his phone most of the time. When we got out, I suggested Dinner and he blew up on me. I stood there and let him go off, and it felt like I was listening to an overgrown toddler.

(Note. It was 9pm- we at lunch at 10:45. He had not eaten since then)
“No! I’m not going to let you ruin my vacation just because you can’t be bothered to be hungry for a bit!” 
“You are a spoiled brat and are exactly like your mother. You two just take and take while I have to pick up what’s left!” 

You get the picture. After, when I finally managed to get him food, he apologized, saying that H was texting him while we were in line, because she wanted to know how much a cruise was, then berated  him for shutting down the question. 

I told him, that it was not an excuse to use me as an outlet to be rude. I told him that it’s not my fault he is still with my mother and at a bad job, so why should I take the heat for it? He got very quiet and at the rest of his food. I feel like an asshole because my dad and I have never fought or had points of tension, and I know he is insecure about his parenting style because he never had a dad. That still shouldn't excuse his actions right? Am I the asshole?

Update/Edit: Thank you to all who told me I was not the AH and that this was not normal. Today there was another incident involving my dad and it did not go well. At the moment, H is out of town, so at the house, it is just my dad and me (and our dog). My dad is working at home for 1/2 of the day because he doesn't want to be near his coworkers in a cubicle. 

I got paid today and drove us to get subs- the entire time he was being very rude and impatient with me (I am cautious like a grandma but I go quite fast). He turned my music off and told me to just shut the hell up and drive cause he didn't have time for this. I ran in, got the food, and when I came out and got in my car it was immediately ""why did you take so long"" ""this is wasting my time"" so forth. 

I told him to not talk to me that way, and that this is not how anyone deserves to be treated. He told me that he raised me basically by himself and he has a right to be mad at me for not going fast. I'm not sure what to do at this point."

  For context, I (20F) reconnected with a girl (20F) that I went to school with from grade 7 on. She actually used to bully me and my best friend, but as time went on we reconnected through a mutual friend and forgave her because we all had grown past that. We will call this friend Jane.

  I'm not judging her for it, but it is a key factor that Jane is an alcoholic. Not just an ""overdoes it here and there"" type of alcoholic, but a full blown getting shit faced to the point it affects her ability to function at all every single day alcoholic.

   Jane got in a dispute at the house she lived at with her family which made it so she was not allowed within a certain distance of her brother, thus she could no longer stay there. She was waiting on the system to see if she was going to get jail time for the charges she got that day (she was on probation from another incident, I was unaware, and she downplayed the new charges to make it seem like it wasn't that bad. I was also unaware.)

   Another friend suggested Jane ask to stay with me until she got her ducks in a row and could figure out a new place to stay. My boyfriend and I are expecting a child, but I was early on in my pregnancy so I agreed. I had a spare room that was vacant for the time being until we were going to turn it into a nursery, I let Jane stay as long as she helped contribute a bit, found someone to watch her dog, and didn't get into any drama here. She was notorious for getting into drama, but my boyfriend and I used to struggle with alcohol and had the same issues so we gave her a chance.

   Fast forward 2 months. She finds out she is going to jail. Minimum sentence, nothing serious. Asks us to keep her stuff until she gets out so she has a place to come back to.. I start thinking woah woah. The agreement was that she would be gone. But I didn't say much at the time as I understand finding out you are going to jail can be stressful enough as it is.

   Then, I found out shes been taunting my recovering alcoholic boyfriend with alcohol and holding it above his head. Always trying to get him to drink with her because she wants a drinking buddy. She succeeds, he cracks. I am not mad at him because I know alcohol addiction is a tough one to break.

   She got mad at him one day for something he said to her while he was drunk and then turned completely. She locked him out of our apartment, accused him of ""forcing himself"" on her when I wasn't home, and told me a whole bunch of things that were all lies. I know they were lies as she admitted it after I left. This caused me to move in with my parents as I believed them to be true (I was still on the lease at the apartment). She told me she was leaving as well and didn't need help moving her stuff.

   My boyfriend desperate for answers finally gets ahold of me and I tell him everything that she had told me and how she admitted that they were all lies because she was mad. Jane never ended up leaving the apartment, she stayed and was trying to sabotage our relationship further. She was telling both of us separate lies about each other, and all the while she was trying to actually get him to sleep with her. I don't know why. This made boyfriend incredibly uncomfortable. This is where I returned.

   I walked into her room, and calmly said ""I don't know how someone can do all these things to someone who had only ever tried to help them out. I think you need to leave tonight."" To which she stressed she needed to stay 4 more days because she was going to jail and had no where else to go. I said ""no, you're going to get the f*** out tonight. I don't care."" At this point I was raising my voice, but all she could say was that she was going to jail and couldn't care about any of this and she was staying for 4 more days. She was adamant that she had done nothing wrong to me and that I was acting out of line.

   This is where I threatened to call the police to remove her. At this point she had her mom and her sister and her sisters girlfriend up my ass, showing up to my apartment. She started telling them the whole time she was here my boyfriend just beat me, she told them to call social services on us, she made up a whole bunch of shit, and on top of that she said ""I don't care if you're pregnant I'm going to beat the shit out of you"" at which point I locked myself in my room and called some friends to sit with me. I let boyfriend handle the rest of it and he watched as she moved her stuff outside. She also demanded her $150 dollars back (our rent is 1800$+utilities, her portion for 2 months was 1200$ at least. We said no and that was another big issue because she said she needed that money to pay for a motel.) I asked her sister why she can't stay with them. They don't want to deal with her either, was her exact response.

   Now I know the answer may seem clear, but hear is my reasoning for why I think I may be the asshole here.

  Her alcoholism, her stress, while it is not my fault and she made her own bed, I can't help but feel a bit guilty as I was in the same boat with drinking and I could have handled it better or more maturely. I also refused to give back the little bit of money she had gave us, knowing that she had none (although rent was already paid). Her mother had to pay for her to stay in a motel until she went in (which I'm not even sure where she is now, I blocked her and everyone associated with her). This all happened a few days ago and I can't help but feel bad. She messed her life up so bad that she literally has nobody, not even her family wanted to put up with it and help her out. I probably could have pretended everything was fine so she had a safe roof over her head for her final days out.

   Sorry this story is kind of messy and potentially confusing. A few people have told me I should have just stuck it out for a few more days. AITA?

TL;DR: AITA for kicking roommate out 4 days before she goes to jail over her creating drama and stress on my relationship, when she had no where else to go? I can't help but feel the drastic reaction came from my final decision to kick her out."
y2svb9_3425,y2svb9,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"   Sorry, this is a messy one and a long one. If you made it through thank you.

  For context, I (20F) reconnected with a girl (20F) that I went to school with from grade 7 on. She actually used to bully me and my best friend, but as time went on we reconnected through a mutual friend and forgave her because we all had grown past that. We will call this friend Jane.

  I'm not judging her for it, but it is a key factor that Jane is an alcoholic. Not just an ""overdoes it here and there"" type of alcoholic, but a full blown getting shit faced to the point it affects her ability to function at all every single day alcoholic.

   Jane got in a dispute at the house she lived at with her family which made it so she was not allowed within a certain distance of her brother, thus she could no longer stay there. She was waiting on the system to see if she was going to get jail time for the charges she got that day (she was on probation from another incident, I was unaware, and she downplayed the new charges to make it seem like it wasn't that bad. I was also unaware.)

y2ym4h_3437,y2ym4h,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,"For starters I 22f and my boyfriend 32m have been together almost two years and we just had a baby 6 months ago. About 2 months after the baby was born he went through my phone while I was sleeping, re downloaded Snapchat after I already deleted it and found messages from guys from before we were together. Which is why I deleted it. So we wouldn’t have this issue. Also he didn’t find anything to justify why he went through it. Now fast forward to 4 days ago. My bf fell asleep and I went through his phone. He was spending a lot of time the bathroom and I wanted to know what he was doing. Well what I found out what he was doing looking at porn(which idc about porn you don’t know anyone personally just from watching porn, looking on an escort page with girl from around the area, and I found tons of females in his snapchat. Now here’s where I wanna know if aita. I left the escort site up on his phone so he’d know I went through it when he woke up. When he got up he started to angry because I don’t trust him, but I feel completely justified. I told him to delete Snapchat, to which that’s where he says I don’t trust him. If I hadn’t of gone through it I wouldn’t of found it. I couldn’t see if he had said anything to these women. Just that they were writing him (he says there all fake). Honestly I don’t care it’s disrespectful to have females in your phone writing you and to not tell me about it. There were about 7 of them that messaged him recently but I couldn’t see but one conversation that a girl wrote nm just got out of school hbu. But I feel he is completely gas lighting me. I understand him being mad about going through it but  I don’t think his anger is justified because of what I found. AITA or is he"

I frequently walk my senior husky back and forth at random hours of the day and night, when I visit my mom or just want to take a walk. The neighbor at the top of the hill just at the entrance of the woods trail, Greg, has three dogs, two golden retrievers and a Doberman Coco. Coco is a f*cking terror. The goldens aren’t so nice either but they do not chase at least. Coco is built like a muscular panther, snorts and huffs and snarls like a bear, and comes after me every time I walk by which is pretty much on my way to anywhere in the neighborhood. It’s terrifying, and since I was already attacked by an unleashed dog in the past and had to pull it off my husky’s neck, we are both understandably scared to death. I have to scream, stomp, and clap and wave my hands to get her to back off as she full charges us Usually he is there to call her off, and I never spoke or said anything to him because I can’t get near the house without being attacked, not even to leave a letter. I figured I wouldn’t *have* to leave a letter, because I figured him witnessing me screaming and crying and dissolving into tears everytime I walk by would be enough. I also have no idea why he lets the dog loose when it’s so aggressive either, and that fact alone makes me so mad. It even attacks out cars when we drive by and it’s CAPABLE OF JUMPING THE FENCE (which is like 7 feet high by the way)It really is traumatic every single time I go out into the neighborhood. I’ve began carrying mace just to get around my development. Of course today , the worst of all happened and I didn’t have my mace. The dog jumped the fence and apparantly Greg isn’t home? So I’m walking up the hill and their house is at the end right where the entrance to the trail is. I went to walk up and coco leapt the giant fence and came at me like a slobbering snarling beast and he WASN’T there this time. The other dogs were going crazy behind the fence and I was screaming ‘get back’ ‘get away’ ‘no’ as it advanced on me , stopping every few seconds to bark and stare me down and I couldn’t run away. My throat is tore up and sore from how loud I had to yell. I backed up slowly and got away from it into the woods from the side of the road. I was with my dog who was crying and freaking out the whole time. So we go for our walk and I didn’t know how to get back without crossing the dog again. I planned on going through someone’s yard and just explaining to them why I’m trespassing, rather then get mauled to death on my innocent morning stroll. I start to go behind the adjacent neighbors and wouldn’t you know it, Coco is there waiting for me, she heard me and ran over behind the house and had me cornered in the woods. Charged at me again and I was carrying a big stick this time,  I once again had to scream and shout and when she kept charging I slammed (and accidentally broke) the big stick I had on the ground and she finally ran off when I did that …. So it’s just been terrifying, and today was so close. Now the catch is I feel bad bc I feel like I’m escalating the situation without a warning but I also feel like he’s not blind and can clearly see how dangerous it is? Plus I can’t even get near his mailbox to leave a note. I’m so scared I’m going to be attacked one day. But I feel bad because he is otherwise a sweet old man, he has a little orange cat that follows the dog pack, he loves his garden and the woods and his dogs.

y359o2_3451,y359o2,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"So here’s the thing I 25f just bought a home 3bed 2 bath. My parents 57m and 50f needed a place to stay as the place they were renting they couldn’t afford anymore because my grandmother was paying for it mostly until she died. Now my parents have helped me a lot over the years but I Always paid them back. So they asked to move in while I was in escrow. I said sure. Now here’s my first mistake which has been pointed out. I gave them the master because they said they would pay for most of my mortgage. Well move in day and I ended up with not only a small bedroom but paid THEIR movers fee of 2500. They promised to pay me back. It’s been 4 months. They also went back on the deal and are only paying me $650 total for rent and not for the electric or anything else I’m paying for everything else in the house besides what my friend can put in since she moved into my other room.There are other things they have done leading up to the title like called me when I was 2hrs away to say my dog ran off. I was rushing home to find him. Turns out they thought it would be funny to say my dog ran off? Then told me I shouldn’t be upset when I yelled to FU. They refused to apologize and told me to get over it. Since then there stuff is everywhere my house inside and out looks like an episode of hoarders apparently they had a storage unit they emptied at my home. Now note when I got my house I was living in an apartment that was furnished so I didn’t have anything besides my TV. My bed and kitchen supplies. I’ve asked them multiple times to please clean up but they say it’s MY stuff so I should clean it up?. Sorry for the long back story but just recently they said they don’t have money to cover their portion of the phone bill OR rent. I gave them 2 weeks to figure out a plan and asked them today what’s the situation with money since the mortgage is due soon and I need to plan accordingly plus the phone bill is now past due since they didn’t tell me they didn’t pay their portion of the bill and it’s on my account so my phone would be shut off soon. My friend who rents a room happened to be in the kitchen when I asked this calmly to my dad. He tells me they are working on something and should have it soon and he goes to the bedroom where my mom is. I thought that was the end of it. I was wrong. My mother comes out later and yells I’m horrible for embarrassing my dad infront of my friend and being degrading to him as well. The thing is THEY have told my friend they have  money issues just the other week so it’s nothing new. Plus she’s also yelling this while my friend is right next to me. That I’m awful for asking such a thing and that I never apologized to my dad for saying FU all those months ago. Which btw they never apologized for the dog thing they did even when I asked for one. And that I locked my door the other day while on the phone with my BF. I’ve also recently got into a relationship with a great guy who’s been nothing but supportive of me which  I love. My dad has been making snark remarks like “you should lock him down before he realizes how horrible you truly are” then when I get upset say he was joking. So I locked my door for privacy since they like to walk in all the time even when im working from home.All of this kinda exploded just today. So I’m wondering AITA for asking what’s the plan with the bills?

Update: 
After looking at everyone’s comments I want to say thanks because I did feel manipulated and sadly just felt unsure. I know kicking them out is the definitely the right thing to do now. For those asking my mom did have a job but she got injured and is on workman’s comp since she had a bunch of surgeries the last 2yrs. As for my dad he claims he can’t work anymore for the last 4yrs due to his diabetes and foot pain. He only recently is trying for social security claims he is 90% done with it but since it’s his first round I think he will get denied but he doesn’t think so of course.I also realized the other month when I asked if they could clean up the yard filled with stuff they made rude comments about just up and leaving like trying to manipulate me to leave them alone or else they will leave. I’m officially done being manipulated by them. They texted me asking to have a conversation last night and I ignored it for now. I do love my house. I mainly bought it for the large yard for my dog and the mountains views. But I’m sad now when I’m home, I told my BF I might sell it or rent it out in a few months and just move. He supports whatever I choose and also agrees they need to go no matter what."

Just as a quick background piece of info, Candy has a somewhat high needs mental illness. I myself have OCD, anxiety and depression disorders.

18 years ago Candy was at my Mom's house while we were all helping her move. Candy kept getting in my way when I was trying to carry heavy items through the door. I asked her multiple times to please move (I was very polite at first) because she was making things not only difficult but dangerous (What if I dropped something because she was in the way). After about the 5th time I got exasperated and said, in a loud voice, ""Candy! You need to get out of the damn doorway!"" 

She rounded on me and said ""If you don't leave me alone I'm gonna rip your fucking head off!""

I said ""Just fucking try it! I will drop you with one hit!""

My cousin got in between us and got her to move off to a far corner of the yard. 

Since that day I have refused to talk to her and it was fine until about a month ago when she tried to apologize and asked if we could start over. I ignored her request.

I can be civil if she and I happen to be in the same room but other than that I refuse to interact with her.

The problem is now Ken is saying if I don't accept her apology he will stop talking to me. I love Ken but Candy gives me major anxiety.

It would be difficult under normal circumstances but with my mental disabilities I just can't be around someone so toxic. I know she's disabled too and I get it; trust me, I just can't deal with her. 

AITA for not accepting her apology?"

y3hjqx_3469,y3hjqx,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"A little back story. I have an OnlyFans account. I keep my face completely out of my OF and I don’t show any of my fans who I am or my face. Also, my sister used to date this guy, which is how I know him. 

Anywho, I have an OF snapchat account. It is separate from my main for obvious reasons. My bitmoji on there looks nothing like me and my name is abbreviated on there so there’s no real way to tell it’s me. This guy added me on there, which I thought was weird because I hadn’t matched with him on any of my several promotional apps and I hadn’t seen his name through any of them at all. I checked. I didn’t realize it was my sisters ex until halfway through the convo, and I knew he had been dating this girl. So I asked just in case if he had a girlfriend. He said no. I didn’t believe him, but I didn’t tell him that. He knew from the start it was an OF promotional account. He was flirting and I kept the act going because I wanted to see if he suspected it was me or not. He didn’t. At all. So I did some digging and found his girlfriend and I sent her a message and asked, “hey, are you and (x) still together?” She said they were. So I took screenshots and blocked him on snap, and sent them to her apologizing that I had to be the one to tell her what was going on. She said thank you, and that was the end. I told her if she needed anything to contact me. Well I got a few notifications that she had deleted some messages, then I went to look at her profile and she had blocked me completely. 

I am so confused. Did I do something wrong? I was trying to help. Keep in mind this guy cheated on my sister I believe with this same girl. (I could be wrong so don’t take that for truth) AITAH??

Edit: she unblocked me. She didn’t block me in the first place, he went on her phone and blocked me. She’s thanking me and asking for help."

y3rmql_3477,y3rmql,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I know this sounds bad but please hear me out. So a little bit of back story, my aunt (now 42F) got married into our family when I was very young and her and my uncle had their first born when I was 9years old. In short when they, went in to have the baby but due to some complications with her and the baby they baby boy didn’t make it. When this happened it was devastating to everyone, however, I was still so young that I didn’t really know what had happened other than the baby didn’t make it. This was also the first memory of ever going to a funeral in my life. I also remember walking up the the casket to see his and I have a very distinct memory of what he looked like because to me, being so young, he just looked like he was asleep. Fast forwarding to this year, my husband (22m) and I (22f) welcomed our beautiful baby boy. He is our fist baby and at the time I lived across the country do to my husband job so I have no family but my husband and only had made one friend where we lived. I didn’t have much of a support system because my support system was 3,000 miles away. When I went in to have the baby everything was fine, I labored for 40 hours in total. During that time several things didn’t go as planned and come to find out the cord was wrapped around my baby’s neck so his heart rate would drop into the 60s from 120s any time I had a contraction. They rushed me in to the OR for an emergency c-section where my beautiful baby boy was born. The next day, once I was feeling a little bit better, I text a few pictures from the night before and that morning just to my close family so they were able to see him. Everything was fine until my aunt made the comment about how he looked just like her first born, especially how he looked when he was sleeping. Being a first time mom I didn’t think much of it until I watched him sleep. I never realized babies breathe so shallow when they are that some. This scared me so much because it was at that point the only thing I could think of and picture when my baby was sleeping was the image of her son laying in his casket. I don’t sleep for 5 days after that because I couldn’t sleep feeling like if I were to fall asleep and wake up to find him actually not breathing. Eventually I was able to take small naps while my husband held him and took care of him. It took me about a month before I could get more than 45 minutes of sleep at a time. Around this time I sent out more pictures just to keep people updated. All was good and well until she made the same comment again. My heart dropped. All that work to be able to be comfortable enough to sleep again went right out the window. I didn’t sleep for another 4 days after that. I was struggling so much trying to take care of the baby and myself because my husband had to go back to work by then and I was home alone with the baby and no one to help me. My one friend that I did have also worked 6 days a week so she wasn’t able to come help either. I felt so helpless. I called my mom and dad in tears and they decided they would mention something to them about what was going on. They didn’t want me to have to deal with the extra stress of having to talk to them about the issue because my aunt was an overly dramatic person in general, so they knew it wouldn’t go over well. When they called to talk to them the plan was to just talk to my uncle and to ask him to talk to her about it. All they wanted to ask was that they don’t mention how much the boys look alike, especially when my son is asleep, to me directly. We never asked her to stop talking about him in general or anything like that, just to me because it was effecting me and causing me to have a hard time taking care of my newborn being a new mom. When they made the phone call, I guess she was right there next to my uncle and blew up. She didn’t even give my parents a chance to explain and kept going on and on about how disrespectful it was to tell someone to not talk about their past child and that he was still a person and was very much loved (which I 100% agree that he was still a person, that he was still very loved and that she should be able to talk about him in general). Ever since then they barely show up to family function and even if my brother(24m) is just there, she can’t stand to see him or my parents or myself or the baby especially. I never meant for things to go this way and if she were to say something to me now about it I would be just fine because I know how my son sleeps and how he acts regularly. Recently, we were able to move back to our home state and I’d like to be able to see my uncle and cousins because they are the only ones who haven’t met the baby now and I haven’t seen my uncle in almost 2 years. My sons is about 4 months old now and I’m afraid with the holidays coming up that if I don’t get to see at least my uncle and talk to him that it may cause issues at thanksgiving and Christmas time, which for my family is an important time of the year. So what should I do? And am I the asshole?"

We like this lifestyle choice, it works for us. I have the most education and would make the most money, and she's the best with kids. I refuse to act like working full time gives me an excuse to not be present at home, so I do a fair amount of cleaning over the weekend or at night and do every bit of the cooking once I get home, by choice, because I cook quite well and enjoy it. We also rotate shifts for whos turn it is to put the baby to bed, and I handle him over the weekends when I'm home. over all we try very hard to make things 50/50, and it usually works out great. However, I've run into a little hitch. Im not expecting a clean house everyday, cause lets be honest, babies are a lot of work. I come from a big family and I totally understand how household tasks sometimes need to be put on the backburner. My wife is entitled to mental health days and breaks because parenting is a job no matter how much you love your kid. 

but lately its beginning to feel like she will not clean or even pick up for the entire week, and would rather wait till I'm  home. She'll be home all day, (taking great care of our baby) but neglects to pick up some toys or throw away snack wrappers or load the dishwasher. I not only get it, but encourage not stressing about cleaning everyday, I'm not asking for that. Our kiddo gets fussy and can be a little high maintenance at times. But when she becomes stressed and irritable about the condition of the house after I've been at work all week, its very hard to refrain from becoming frustrated. 

i don't want to be an ass, and I may not even have a valid reason for being frustrated. I love her very much, and don't want to offend or upset her, so I figured id ask some impartial people. Is it wrong to bring this up to her? she's not lazy by any means, she takes good care of me and our son, and maybe my standard for the house is too high. Whats your thoughts?"

I told him I wanted an apology and our children will never go to church with her again. He waited all day to talk to her and as the day went on I was getting more upset because I knew he wasn’t going to talk to her because he has never put her in her place when she has overstepped boundaries in the past. He finally got her on the phone around 5 and she had the audacity to start yelling at him about how dare he call her out. She doesn’t see anything wrong with what she did and claimed she didn’t realize the girls were catholic which is a load of crap because she was there when the both of them were baptized in a Catholic Church and my oldest first holy communion.

y5ej14_3528,y5ej14,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"I apologise for any mistakes, I am pretty emotional rn and english is not my first language.

So my (16F) mother (44F) has a not so secret boyfriend (50s? M) and it's negatively affecting mine and my brother's (13M) life. 
The guy is trash. He cheats on her constantly and overall gives me the creeps. I haven't yet officially met him but once she brought him to our apartment as he got drunk and I guess wasn't able to get home. I saw him for a few seconds and locked my brother and myself into our room. I was too afraid to even go to the toilet idk why maybe it was just my perception of him but I don't feel comfortable in his presence. 

I've got to know of him mainly through their phone calls. We live in a quiet small apartment and they often argue really loudly. You can hear both of them clearly. Their relationship is the type Zeus and Hera had. The guy constantly cheats and his spouse bashes the oher women. The thing that bothers me the most is that after every argument she gets drunk and picks fights. Today is a great example. I was studying for my test tomorrow and my brother comes in to tell me that either we cook lunch now (11am) or we won't be allowed to eat at all. I tried to talk to her and told her that if she is hungry she can make her own food and we'll cook for ourselves later. She didn't want to hear it and started arguing how she always takes care of me and gives me everything and that I'm ungrateful. I've had enough and just told her ""well I'm sorry you decided to have kids then"" and she started threatening that she'll kick me out and that I have no right to speak back to her and if she says I am not allowed to eat then I won't eat. 

It's not just that she also has a lot of medical problems which alcohol makes even worse and she often faints or get sick and then I have to stay up till early morning hours to help her although I have school the next day. And once I fell asleep and didn't hear her calling me and she guilt tripped (?) me for not waking up. Or she forgets things like last week I asked if I can go out with my friends after school and she told me yes only to have my younger brother frantically calling me all day because she apparently didn't know where I was and he was worried sick (she didn't call me once) as I don't usually stay out late (if you count 5 pm as late).

I really want to tell her (once she sobbers up) to get her crap together as I can't live like that much longer. She can get borderline abusive and I fear she is getting addicted to alcohol. She also hates when I discuss my problems with people that's why she might get her life in oreder a bit if I threaten to speak to someone about it. 

But I might be TA as I can't really meddle into her relationship and she deserves to be with someone. Also she can be a great mother when she is in her right mind so maybe I'm overreacting and I should just put up with it. WIBTAH?"

I've got to know of him mainly through their phone calls. We live in a quiet small apartment and they often argue really loudly. You can hear both of them clearly. Their relationship is the type Zeus and Hera had. The guy constantly cheats and his spouse bashes the oher women. The thing that bothers me the most is that after every argument she gets drunk and picks fights. Today is a great example. I was studying for my test tomorrow and my brother comes in to tell me that either we cook lunch now (11am) or we won't be allowed to eat at all. I tried to talk to her and told her that if she is hungry she can make her own food and we'll cook for ourselves later. She didn't want to hear it and started arguing how she always takes care of me and gives me everything and that I'm ungrateful. I've had enough and just told her ""well I'm sorry you decided to have kids then"" and she started threatening that she'll kick me out and that I have no right to speak back to her and if she says I am not allowed to eat then I won't eat. 

It's not just that she also has a lot of medical problems which alcohol makes even worse and she often faints or get sick and then I have to stay up till early morning hours to help her although I have school the next day. And once I fell asleep and didn't hear her calling me and she guilt tripped (?) me for not waking up. Or she forgets things like last week I asked if I can go out with my friends after school and she told me yes only to have my younger brother frantically calling me all day because she apparently didn't know where I was and he was worried sick (she didn't call me once) as I don't usually stay out late (if you count 5 pm as late).

I really want to tell her (once she sobbers up) to get her crap together as I can't live like that much longer. She can get borderline abusive and I fear she is getting addicted to alcohol. She also hates when I discuss my problems with people that's why she might get her life in oreder a bit if I threaten to speak to someone about it. 

But I might be TA as I can't really meddle into her relationship and she deserves to be with someone. Also she can be a great mother when she is in her right mind so maybe I'm overreacting and I should just put up with it. WIBTAH?"

when I decided to have s*x. Now my whole life I was told by doctors that I wouldn't be able to have kids because of PCOS( Polycystic Ovaries syndrome).

For the past couple weeks I've been explaining to my bfs mother that I will keep the baby, but every couple days she tells me she has scheduled
an appointment for the abortion. I'll call or text everyday saying I won't go the appointment. Now she's becoming aggressive trying to force me to have one. So am I the asshole for not listening and wanting to keep the baby?"

She told me that she had too much to drink, got carried away and fucked her coworker. I was livid. I was so furious. I stared at her in complete shock and yelled at her. I told her she was a sick bitch, a little hoe and I wish I never met her.

Just a Few days prior this post I got grounded over some simple things and yet I don’t get to keep my phone even though I pay the bill my moms exact words when she took it was “you can keep paying the bill but it is my phone now.” I ask all my friends when I met them do your parents take your phones when you get grounded and some say yes and some no but none of them pay for their phones. I have more phone related stories if anyone is interested but that’s all I have to say.

When me and my sisters was kids he would constantly beat us, we would have bruises, cuts and other injuries. When I was 7 years old the cops busted down the door and arrested my dad for drug possession, child negligent (x3), sexual assault on a minor and a bunch of other charges. After the court hearing was over, I went to therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, mood disorder, ADHD, and depression. He went to prion for 8 years then got out for “good behavior”. He tried reaching out when I was in the 9th grade and I refused and my mom got a court order for him to stay away from me till I turned 18. 
When I was a senior in high school he reached out to me again and I was 18 at that point. So I decided to try to have a relationship with him. Sad to say the meeting went horrible. He blamed everything that happened to him on my mom so I told him to fuck off and then I left with a friend. I cried my eyes out the rest of the day. Fast forward to now, I found out that my dad is dying of liver failure and is not able to get on the transplant list bc he still drinks. My older sister told me this and says I should forgive him and make peace with him before he dies. I told her that it would be a cold day in hell before I would forgive that SOB.

I of course was very supported and told her I love her no matter what. My wife on the other hand congratulated her, but was moody for the rest of the evening. At night, she woke me up and told me that she doesn’t support my daughter and her decisions. She woke me up at 3 in tears telling me she could not sleep and was overthinking everything. I asked what was so wrong with our daughter being homosexual and she told me that she was disgusted and disappointed in her only daughter because she wanted grandkids (which of course can have a 50-50 percent of happening) and I told her even if our daughter does marry a women she can get a donor or surrogate (idk how that works) but that was none of our business. She yelled at me saying “Why aren’t you mad too? I thought you hated gay and lesbian people. You’re just as disgusting as our daughter.” I was shocked. I yelled at her saying “Stop being such a homophobic bitch because its not our decision whether she is bi or not.” I also called her some other things which I deeply regret. She took her car keys and stayed the night at her mom’s house. Next morning, I woke up and was bombarded with messages from her family saying that our daughter is a freak and disgusting, and for you to support her is even worse. My wife is threatening to divorce me if I do not change my daughter’s mind and tell her she would be kicked out if she didn’t convert to straight. I have no intention of doing that, but i’m scared if she might actually go through with the divorce. I love her to bits and it hurts that she doesn’t accept our daughter for her sexuality.

It wasn't until 4th grade that I realized they weren't strict and that they only hated me, during that year I was obsessed with bunnies my room was full of rabbit stuffed animals and when my parents asked me what I wanted as a gift for my birthday me as a 9-year-old girl i was I said that i wanted a bunny My parents explained to me that the reason they couldn't give me a rabbit was because there was no room for him to live. But when my birthday happened one of my classmates gave me a bunny as a gift I obviously wanted to hide it from my parents, my plan was to have it in my room until it was big enough to give to a friend. It worked for a few weeks it wasn't until one day I came back from school and went upstairs and i found my rabbit on my bed with his st0mach 0pen, i cried a lot and when i went to my parents room to ask what had happend they told me to stop crying and that i should take this as a lesson to never lie, After that my parents behavior got worse so when i turn 18 i left and never went back. I never spoke to them again except when i got married with my husband but after the wedding i never saw them again. Two years ago i got pregnant with my daughter and i did wanted to tell them but i ended up not doing it since i hardly thought of them as my parents so i never told them anything about it, but 2 months ago it was my daughter 1s birthday and we were celebrating with my husband and his family but when the party ended i got a call from my parents saying i was an idiot for not telling them i had a child and that i was a bad daughter i told them that they were being ridiculous and that the reason I didn't tell them I had a daughter was because they werent my family anymore and that they should leave me alone and let me Live My Life, so..

My sister and brother in law who work second and third shift started their family. I was so excited for them. They asked me to watch my nephew for the hours their shifts overlapped, since I was awake anyway. I said yes, even though I was pregnant with #5 at the time.

Three years go by and they added my niece to their family. My etsy shop is basically neglected for this entire time as I have to wait until I get both kids to sleep before I can work on anything.

My SIL says something about her husband's work helping pay for child care of a coworker for her mother watching their kid. I asked if that would be something she could look into for me. She said yes and then I never heard anything for months, even though I saw her basically every day of the week. I finally worked up enough courage to ask, my husband insisted. He took a few day off of work and stayed home to help me. He saw exactly how much work watching them was. He was aghast ""You've been doing this for free for three years?!"" He insisted I ask about being paid. He's her direct boss at work, so I didn't feel right about him asking her. A month later I got enough courage to ask. (My SIL is a very explosive personality, you have to walk on eggshells and catch her in the right mood to ask anything) I asked and she said what her friend was doing was sketchy, but asked me what I thought was fair. I told her I didn't know, but I would like to help contribute financially so the burden wouldn't fall solely upon my husband. 
I looked into local nighttime daycare/babysitting rates in my area $20 per hour per kid was the cheapest I could find. I thought that was ridiculously high. (Even though I know that they could afford it, they are very open about how much money they make, and the bills they pay) I knew I couldn't ask for that. I asked her what she thought about $10 an hour for both kids. She freaked out. She said she was thinking of offering me $8 and that everyone she asked said that was ""far too generous"" and that she thought I would ""work with her"". I said I was, but that my offer was $5 less than minimum wage in our area. I heard nothing from her for a week. She was on vacation, so I thought we would talk when she came back. The day before I was set to watch the kids again I get a text that my services would no longer be required. I was hurt that after three years of helping them I was dropped like a lead balloon. I know I should have spoken up sooner, or said something before agreeing.  But #1 I was so excited to spend time with my newest nephew, and #2 it never occurred to me that they wouldn't offer to pay ever.
So much has happened since then, which I can elaborate on later if you want. But this was the catalyst. I need some true outside perspective with zero emotions involved. Help!"

Nothing happened between my mother and I that I couldn’t stay with her I just never settled into her house when she moved out as I had spent the first 2 years of my life constantly spending time with my gran while my mother was at work.

My mother has more children but the main two are my brothers Jay (19M) and Harry (17M).

As I got older my gran informed me that my aunt and mother argued that when my uncle moved out either my cousin or Jay would move in. My cousin who is 15 used to be a bit of a trouble maker but has since calmed down. Whereas my brother has constantly been a trouble maker, he constantly starts arguments with Harry and myself, breaks his things and our things, talks back to our mother and since he’s moved in with his girlfriend every argument they get into they involve my mother and causes her stress.

Jay has lived with his girlfriend for a couple of months, he moved in with her around the same time our uncle finally moved out of my grans house.

When my uncle moved out my gran told me that her and my grandfather agreed I could have his room while keeping my room to turn one of the rooms into a mini living room as my bedroom was very small and cramped anytime I had friends over. Since then I’ve spent a lot of my own money decorating the room, I moved in my tv and bought myself a couch so that whenever I had friends over we had somewhere to sit.

Which brings me to the issue. A few weeks back my mother told my gran about how she told Jay that if him and his girlfriend break up he has to find his own apartment as the house has been a lot calmer since he moved out and that anytime he comes to visit he constantly starts arguments with Harry. She then told my gran that she told Jay that since she has the spare room he could just move in with us.

My gran explained that all my stuff was in the spare room and that we didn’t have a second bed. She told my mother that he could stay a night or two if he had to but she wasn’t having him stay constantly.

A few weeks later my mother mentions it again, she asked my gran why Jay can’t sleep on my sofa bed (I don’t own one) and when my gran explained this she asked why he couldn’t just sleep on the couch or why can’t I sleep on the couch and he can have my bed as I don’t need two rooms.

My gran explained that my couch wasn’t the biggest and that I paid for it myself so if Jay was to move in he wouldn’t have anything in the room as all my stuff would be moved into the one room.

A few days later my mother then asks me if I’d be willing to let Jay have my extra room and to leave my tv and couch in the room so he’s able to play his Xbox and have somewhere to sleep. I told her no as I paid for my tv and couch myself and I wasn’t going to inconvenience myself because she was refusing to let Jay move in. At this my mother called me selfish for not being willing to share with my brother and that with work and university I wouldn’t be using my tv and PlayStation as much so he should be allowed to have the spare room and use my things.

When I got home I told my gran all this. I asked if she told my mother he could move in to which she said no as she couldn’t handle or afford to keep him as my mother had him expecting to have everything replaced if he breaks it and doesn’t want to deal with his rudeness. She told me she repeatedly told my mother he wasn’t moving in which she is ignoring.

After this I texted my mother saying that my gran has already told her Jay isn’t moving in and that even if he was I wouldn’t give him my tv and stuff. She once again called me selfish and told me I didn’t deserve my stuff if I wasn’t willing to share with my brother.

I feel like an asshole but know he’d break my things and know my gran doesn’t want to deal with his attitude. So AITAH?"
y7e82q_3610,y7e82q,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (21M) have lived with my grandparents since I was born. Nothing happened between my mother and I that I couldn’t stay with her I just never settled into her house when she moved out as I had spent the first 2 years of my life constantly spending time with my gran while my mother was at work.

My mother has more children but the main two are my brothers Jay (19M) and Harry (17M).

As I got older my gran informed me that my aunt and mother argued that when my uncle moved out either my cousin or Jay would move in. My cousin who is 15 used to be a bit of a trouble maker but has since calmed down. Whereas my brother has constantly been a trouble maker, he constantly starts arguments with Harry and myself, breaks his things and our things, talks back to our mother and since he’s moved in with his girlfriend every argument they get into they involve my mother and causes her stress.

Jay has lived with his girlfriend for a couple of months, he moved in with her around the same time our uncle finally moved out of my grans house.

When my uncle moved out my gran told me that her and my grandfather agreed I could have his room while keeping my room to turn one of the rooms into a mini living room as my bedroom was very small and cramped anytime I had friends over. Since then I’ve spent a lot of my own money decorating the room, I moved in my tv and bought myself a couch so that whenever I had friends over we had somewhere to sit.

y7pxrb_3616,y7pxrb,top-comment,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,I am the youngest of 4 sibling on my mother's side. My parents got married before they had me they got baptized when I was 10 the day before my father told my mother he had another daughter she was devastated and cried however she did not stop him from having a relationship with her sometimes she would even go along with him to see her and would come back and tell me and my brothers how disrespectful she and her mother was. My father and his side of family always disrespected my mother because his mother never liked her. My eldest brother let's call him Tom he was from a previous relationship before my father got with my mother and had my other two brothers he is very unreasonable.  My mother has never let my half-sister come to the family home she would always let my father meet her at their home or somewhere local. My mother got sick last year and died and ever since my father has insisted to live my sister come stay with us. Tom is agreeing with this with his reasoning that we shouldn't grow separate but we have been going separate because I am now 17 and I was 10 when we found out about her and she has never been to the house. Me and my other two brother told our father that we don't want her at the house however he didn't listen and still brought her here. Seeing her lying down in my mother's bed knowing that she wouldn't be at the family home if my mother was alive hurts. I don't want a relationship with her. At all. And when I mean cut off I mean moving out and stop talking to all of them.

Hey guys this is actually my first post here ever, so I apologize if the format is weird. I, early 20s female, have been on again off again with a guy, age 26, since our late teenage years. Previously I did have to have a restraining order and there were physically and emotionally aggressive acts on his part in the past, but it’s been about five years since a physical altercation. I recently tried to give him another chance, and he wrote a list of demands and said they were reasonable, and I could post it and ask anybody and they’ll tell me it’s the bare minimum- so here I am. To confirm, I did initially agree to everything except not going to a professional for a wax, seeing as that’s important to me, and I am a bigger girl so shaving is both difficult and uncomfortable, as I also have sensitive skin/get razor bumps. He admitted to me in person that he was never going to ask me to stop waxing until I said it was a “hard limit”/ boundary for me, and that I would not stop doing it for a partner. So he admitted that he heard “no” and then felt the need to demand it, with the expectation he’d leave me if I did not stop, which to me is the real kicker/issue with the request/seems like it’s about control, not respect? We had a fight on the matter, and he told me we were over several times bc I’m  a “wh**e”  for flashing my ***** to “strangers” (wax specialists) and called me horrible names and refused to speak to me the remainder of the day/laid in my bed and ignored me. Also to add- he’s recently homeless and I’ve been helping him. Keeping his stuff at my place, letting him stay with me, keeping his cat for him, driving him around, etc. he has no job, car, or license. So I was pretty upset he was treating me that way after everything I’d done for him these past weeks. A couple days later, as usual- he tried to act like nothing happened and expected me to just be fine with his millionth tantrum where he just screams and degrades me for an hour while I say nothing or try to calm him down. When he acted as if everything was fine- I simply said “I’m not leaving you, I am here for whatever you need, I love you, but your words and actions have consequences, and I will not be pretending like your behavior the other night was ok, and that I’m ok” He was angry and didn’t speak to me for a couple days and then sent me an angry message after seeing a photo of my sister and I together at a bar, where I was wearing makeup. He told me to get f**ked, since that’s all I’m good for, blamed me for “ending us” and told me the next time he sees me I better be on my knees in tears if I want him back. He then disappeared from my family members home where we set him up with his own room to stay.. I haven’t looked for him and I stand by what I said.  To add context for the list- We spend 7 days a week together 90% of the time, and he gets angry if I even look at my phone. If I turn the other way to go to sleep, if I don’t go to bed at the same time as him. He wants my undivided attention 24/7 even when I’m working or trying to sleep, or he becomes angry and drags it out for hours or days. AITA for not immediately adhering to this list/not looking for him now? I feel it’s not my job to track him down and give him his stuff- he wasn’t kicked out, and it was a free place to stay w heat wifi food etc. He hasn’t responded to any contact from my family who took him in. Rules are pasted in the comments/it was too long/ if you can post photos here, idk how yet. TIA!  AITA?"

I currently care for a one year old little girl we will call A and a 7 year old little girl we will call Z. Z is spoiled. And acts the part. Whenever I have to tell Z no she becomes extremely violent towards me and her baby sister. I have pictures of bruises and marks she has left on my body after having to restrain(bear hug) her bc of her violent behavior. She has tried to rip her sister out of the crib by her head aswell as attempts to rip my arms from under the baby while I’m standing on hard wood(the baby most likely would have been hospitalized due to her age and possible head trauma). I’ve tried having talks with her mother but it doesn’t seem to go anywhere she just plays it off as something they are working on. My final straw was when she accused me of beating her and reported me to DCF. Now I’ve been around young children my entire life with and without disabilities. I would NEVER touch a child to intentionally hurt them. Dcf launched a 15 day investigation where ofc they found the allegations to be untrue. Those types of accusations could ruin my entire future as I want to continue working with children. It’s been a month since the case was closed and I refuse to go near Z. I get paid to live here. $50 a day for both kids. I personally don’t think $20 for an abusive child is nearly enough to cover both the physical and emotional trauma she has inflicted. I don’t know what to do. I do not get along with the father as he is an aggressive drunk who threatened to destroy all my belongings and kick me out bc I told him he needs to be respectful to his partner who had just recently got back from a week stay at the hospital where she almost died. I’m already looking for new places to live I just want to be sure I’m not overreacting here. Would you put up with the abuse from a 7 year old for months? Or am I doing the right thing?

I live in a rural town where buying specific items is a challenge and if shops do stock the items, they will be quite expensive. The next city is around an hour and a half away. 

I have taken my baby to the city maybe 
once in the past month shopping all day for stuff we either need or stuff I want such as baby clothes or clothes for me as my PP body is always changing. 

I have a friends birthday coming up soon so I needed to go to the city to buy an outfit and everything, he wasn’t happy about this because we apparently go there too often and it’s not good for the baby to be in the car and shopping all day. 

I didn’t get everything I needed as the day ran out so around 5 days later I went back to the city to get my friend her bday gift and the finishing touches to my outfit. The event is only 2 days after this, and is in the city, but I have to pick up family visiting me and the baby and won’t have time to shop before the event so I wanted to be sure I had everything before then so it wasn’t a big stress on the day. 

When he found out I went he was extremely unhappy and told me off for taking the baby in another long car ride and shopping when i’m going back there in two days. I tell him it’s good for the baby to go out and get used to being in loud crowded places or he won’t like it when he’s older. 

I just can’t see where he is coming from, if bub is happy then I feel like it should be  okay?

y94434_3670,y94434,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Basically,a year ago, my best friend of 17 years and I got in a huge fight. She was upset I could not follow through with a garage sale I was supposed to help her with. I have 3 young kids under 7 and a busy husband with his own business. My kids were coming down with a cold and my husband had to work that Saturday so I had no one to watch my kids while helping her with her garage sale. I guess it was the straw that broke the camel’s back with her… I flaked every now and then, but only bc I’m seriously busy and tired with my kids and school and life. Sometimes I can’t follow through with plans. She has only one kid and her husband helps and mother in law with childcare. Anyway, she was about a month away from giving birth, so I understand she was stressed and tired and she had understandably been busting her ass for this garage sale. 
She said things about my husband, called him selfish. She said things along the lines of me acting exactly like my husband (everything I complained about him), she also said things like “you and your husband only do nice things for people so you can turn around and throw it in their faces”… and also accused me of changing because I had just started taking adderrall for my adhd. Making me feel like an addict or something.. All this she said after knowing I was going through a rough patch with my husband and was really having a hard time in life.. During this fight I never said anything remotely hurtful or degrading to her. I knew this was a moment that would change our friendship. I felt betrayed. That she used all this private information I confided in her about against me. 
We didn’t speak for 4 months, she texted me out of the blue saying was sorry and we need to squash this. I told her I wasn’t ready to talk. I gave it another chance.It didn’t feel natural or genuine so I told her I can’t do this anymore. I’m not sure if I did the right thing but I sure don’t feel like I can trust her again."

She was upset I could not follow through with a garage sale I was supposed to help her with. I have 3 young kids under 7 and a busy husband with his own business. My kids were coming down with a cold and my husband had to work that Saturday so I had no one to watch my kids while helping her with her garage sale. I guess it was the straw that broke the camel’s back with her… I flaked every now and then, but only bc I’m seriously busy and tired with my kids and school and life. Sometimes I can’t follow through with plans. She has only one kid and her husband helps and mother in law with childcare.

y9m0zu_3692,y9m0zu,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"For Context, I (23M) had cutted context with my Parents for over 5 years, But Before that We had little to nothing bond as Parents-Child Relationship.
My Parents had me when they're dating in College, It was unplanned pregnancy for them and a 'tied' for them to actually get married and move into the next level of life, they struggling retaking their classes while also getting shitty part time jobs.
in My Child until Teenagerhood, I lived with my Grandparents (both sides, They're in the same neighborhood), and My Parents rarely visited me, Naturally We don't really bond as a Family there. 
Before I was 15, I was sucker for their attention and love, That I always invited them to all of my events, Though they never came due of something else came up. 

They never said 'Good job' or If they're proud of me and I'd always sent them news of my achievements, and They would boosted about my Achievement on their social medias, Pretending that they 'raise' me Great.
But Eventually I realized, That I can't fix this family bond with them when they obviously never wanted me. 

They had more children when I was 15, and by that time, My Grandparent (From Mom side) had died from heart attack and They left their fortune to my other grandparents as they raised me, I permanently lived with my Other Grandparents, nothing change there.

Well, Except the fact that My Parents absolutely love my Siblings (they're twin girls), their babies were the apples in their eyes, and would visited us much more often to dump their babies around so I also babysitting my Siblings. Yet by the end of the visits they never had once consider letting me in their home as Their own child too.

I grew older, and got myself an University Schoolarship in another city, Obviously My Grandparents were happy and support me with it, so I went along.

I got no news from my Parents, Before they randomly sent me a Homophobic messenge after I dated my first boyfriend. They said along the line that they're no longer would consider me as their child nor that I'll ever sees my siblings again if I don't break up with him.

I already know which one should I cut off my life, again We don't have that family bond. So it was easy. . .yet I still felt hurt when I got openly abandoned just like that by them.

I still in contacts with my Grandparents tho, I still goes home to them when I need too. They're still my family, The people that I consider my own parents.
Now I lived with my Fiance (Male, 25y/o) that already knows my situation with my parents (we already knows each other from my childhood (We're neighbors, His parents and my Grandparents were friends) but we just dated three years ago and recently got engaged).

Like last Four months, I received my Grandparents had been diagnosed with a lot of illness, I have been taking care of their health and their hospital bills (My Fiance helped me) as My Parents Doesn't want anything with my dying 'old geezers' and me.
I heard that their workplaces had been dying through the pandemics, while My Small Dessert box business flourish in the 2021, So Apparently that's their excuse for not helping with their dying parents.

And Sadly, Recently My Grandparents had died. They passed away in the same day, just away 2 hours from each other.

Of course I'd be the one responsible for their burial while I also graving from their deaths.

 Expectedly my Parents didn't came into the funeral, and We all have been called by Lawyer for my Grandparent's will.

I met them again, My Siblings were expecting to see me that they just hugged me, I was glad that my Parents haven't corrupted them with their homophobic asses. I missed them so much that I cried again.

Now comes the will, My Grandparents had left me their fortune. It's worth 10 million dollars, and left my Parents with nothing but an old family car.

Expectedly my Parents went red with rage as they had no idea that my grandparents had that much money, but said nothing as the Lawyer then told us that My Grandparents also left us with two videos.
It seems after the marriage of my parents, my Grandparents (from two sides) were disappointed with their only children choices to me. Two of the families went closer without the couple (my Parents) and Make their own business with the help of my Fiance's parents as my own parents couldn't be trusted with the business if they can't even sees me as their own.

My Fiance's Parents were already have a good business, Naturally They helped my Grandparents managed that business. 
My Fiance's parents were a great business Partner, that the Business quickly flourish into a Millions worth companies.

So now the Fruits and the whole 'plan' of that business, Went to me, as I basically raised by them and They knows me pretty well that I took care of them in their last Moments.
Now, My Parents were begging me to basically hand them the inheritance that I received from my Late Grandparents. They were using the 'We are your family' or 'Come on Son, Don't you want your siblings to have the best lives?' bullshi-

I don't know what I should do now, Will I be the Asshole if I don't give my parents what they want? Will I be an asshole if I don't want them in my life anymore?"

He rubbed his ""Thing"" Against mine (I was half asleep) I woke up and he immediately got off me and said good morning and asked what I wanted to eat since he was going to buy takeout, So I immediately messaged my mother that I wanted to be picked up today.

One Shibu Inu and 8 week old one australian shepherd. The Australian Shepherd is his sister's dog but My fiancé and i agreed to take care of her dog while she's at school. Since he started work again he's been more tired and grouchy. His job is difficult to handle and do. He's a line cook and he's on his feet for hours.

In fact a few days ago we had an argument about him taking responsibility because we both agreed to help out his sister and take care of the Australian Shepherd but he wanted to help care of it.

He got mad and told me to shut up.  Before his sister left for School he was getting upset at the fact that the Australian Shepherd started to cry in her pin because she's going to be a big dog and we don't want or need her to be sleeping on the couch. His sister was in the living room and he was about to leave our room naked. I told him to go put somethin on and he was like "" Can u just shut up, I'm not trying to be an asshole but shut up for a minute"" in like the most rudest way possible.

This isnt the first family member of his we have taken in so I get why I wasn't asked. (the last family member temporarily stayed for 6years!) Although I wasn't happy about not being asked first, I caved and agreed to help them out and see how things go. My partner assured me he would take care of any issues that come up. Cool. 
I also said that given she has 3 kids of her own, and he has 1, that there was no way they were bringing their children into our home, that's way too many mouths to feed and far too much energy for me to handle. (I work full time and my own kids can be demanding - they would also both be on night shift meaning if their kids were here, they'd be mine and my partners responsibility). Given that things can take a while to sort out (jobs, homes etc) I don't want my home overcrowded for an extended period of time. He agreed, and I assume this was told to them prior to them coming to our home. 
A couple days ago I overheard my BIL and his gf talking, saying ""we'll go pick her up soon"". I had no idea who or what they were talking about so I said nothing. A few minutes later my BIL casually says ""oh yeah, we're bringing my gfs 10yr old down soon because she's too much to handle for their grandma"". I was stunned at how he seemed to think this would be OK. I asked my partner if BIL had asked him about doing this, to which he says no, he sprung this on him too. I reminded my partner about what I said about them not bringing their kids to our home, because that was not the plan and he said he would talk to him. 
It has been a couple days and he hasn't spoken to my BIL because he doesn't want to fight and cause tension. There's already tension because I'm bottling up my feelings over it and I'm tired of tip toeing around my home. I don't know what to say to them, I know whatever I do say will come out harshly but I'm not willing to cram my home and wreck my peace for them. I'm cool with the kids coming to visit but they cannot live here.
So, WIBTAH if I tell them myself they're not allowed to bring their kids here instead of waiting for my partner to do it?
Any advice would he appreciated.

..........................------.............................

Update:
BIL and gf rolled in the doors around 3am the next morning. I suspected they would so they could avoid us and pretend like nothing happened.

BIL made breakfast for everyone and once my kids were done, I sent them outside to play and told BIL and gf we had to go over what we talked about.

My BIL goes straight into saying it's stressful on his gf not being with her kids and he said they felt like they had no choice but to move her daughter in so their grandma isn't so stressed out either.
My partner then told them, while he gets it, this is our home. Anything that involves our home need to be discussed with us before any decisions are made but ultimately, the decision is ours - you both have no decision making powers here.

Gf got up and left to her room briefly while BIL told us they have already told the 10yr old she couldn't come. The gf then came back in and said now her 10yr old is upset and she's worried she'll act out even more. I think that was an attempt to guilt trip us so I chose to ignore that part and push on.

We once again said, we understand- but you need to tell us your plans before you make them because they impact on all of us.
She then packs a fuss and says she might as well pack her bags and leave since she's not welcome. I told her that's her choice but she is welcome, so long as they stick to what was agreed.

Gf leaves, BIL apologizes for the situation but agrees to talk to us better in future.
My partner and I then went out to enjoy an awesome family day of sports and bbqs, while they had the house to themselves. 
Everything has been a little awkward but atleast things are cleared up. We can only see how things go from here.

Thank you all for your words. I have shown my partner all of your comments - they were upsetting to him because he didn't realize how clueless he had been, but ultimately took it all on board."

The town is a very accepting place, my dad is the reverend for the church so everyone knows me, hence knowing I am bi. Alex (my bf) asked me to babysit his little brother(9) the other week. I obviously agreed as he gets on well with my son so i thought it would be easy enough. I put my son to bed first, as he is a lot younger than Alex's little brother who we'll call Cian (fake name). Cian then started calling me offensive names to do with my sexuality. He had never said anything like this before so at first i was shocked on how he even knew the words and would say them to me. I asked him how he knew those words and he said he heard his parents and Alex calling me it. I went mad. I told Cian never to say anything like that to me again as it wasn't nice. He proceeded to tell me about how he is right and I am 'disgusting' for liking girls. I told him he was being a little shit, accidentally swearing.

When Alex came to pick him up the next morning I acted as nothing was wrong even though I was really hurt that he would say things behind my back about me being bi. A couple of days ago he asked me again to babysit and I said no, he then apparently asked Cian on why I didn't agree and if he was bad the previous time. Cian told Alex I swore at him and Alex called me and started screaming at me about how messed up I was for swearing at Cian. I told him I was angry as Cian made me really upset (leaving out why) Alex never asked what he did to make me upset but told me the least i could do was babysit him again, once again i said no so he started calling me an asshole, he then told his own family that i didn't agree to look after Cian and that all their plans were ruined, they also decided I was an asshole. I can't stand the fact that Alex and his family talked lowly of my sexuality and don't care enough to even ask about my point, but i don't have the confidence to tell him. What should I do? AITA?

Update: I just want to say thank you for all the support and advice! I really didn't expect this to get any attention. I did as suggested and talked to Alex today and as it was asked I will tell how it went. I want to clarify again I am 18 so not overly mature and it toke me until people told me to talk to him for me to actually do so. I also do need to say again that I didn't know he would do something like that, I also had so much trust in him that this really hurt.

This morning I asked Alex to meet up with me, he agreed to meet up almost straight away, when we met up I told him (as recommended) that one of my best friends who is also bi was shamed behind her back for being bi, I asked him why he thinks someone would do something like that and his answer was ""maybe they thought being bi is sl*ty."" At this I genuinely almost broke down because I knew this is what he really thought of my sexuality. He must of been able to tell I was upset and asked what was wrong. I then finally told him that Cian had told me what is said behind my back. He just f&gt;ckin sat there, didn't say a word. I realised in that exact moment that everyone saying I didn't deserve someone like that in my life was right, and neither does my own son. I told him this, he told me he was 'sorry' and that 'he didn't mean it' I honestly thought these were just excuses and walked out of the café. After I post this message I'm going to pack all of his things he has left over my house and give them back. I feel so disappointed in myself for letting this go on for weeks and even just being with him in the first place, I feel slightly relieved at the same time though as this has been holding me down for weeks. I wish this never happened but I am so thankful for the advice and support people have given me, as I know i needed it to do this especially since I will now be a single teen mother again and that someone I trusted so much broke my trust so quickly."

The town is a very accepting place, my dad is the reverend for the church so everyone knows me, hence knowing I am bi. Alex (my bf) asked me to babysit his little brother(9) the other week. I obviously agreed as he gets on well with my son so i thought it would be easy enough. I put my son to bed first, as he is a lot younger than Alex's little brother who we'll call Cian (fake name). Cian then started calling me offensive names to do with my sexuality. He had never said anything like this before so at first i was shocked on how he even knew the words and would say them to me. I asked him how he knew those words and he said he heard his parents and Alex calling me it. I went mad. I told Cian never to say anything like that to me again as it wasn't nice. He proceeded to tell me about how he is right and I am 'disgusting' for liking girls. I told him he was being a little shit, accidentally swearing.

When Alex came to pick him up the next morning I acted as nothing was wrong even though I was really hurt that he would say things behind my back about me being bi. A couple of days ago he asked me again to babysit and I said no, he then apparently asked Cian on why I didn't agree and if he was bad the previous time.

I also share this info with my friends. I work very hard for this and pay for it all by myself. Just a month back I took another trip abroad. this time I had a conference abroad and ended up making a solo trip out of it.

A friend of mine called me last week saying even she is making a trip abroad as even she has ""a conference"" there and making a trip out of it. she didn't have any job till this year and neither her family is rich. she has a taste for fancy things and since she never had money of her own she always dated rich guys who bought her plenty of things.

I was never bothered by it but became very angry/jealous that she is doing the same thing that I am doing but by the means of another rich guy's money and not even admitting it. she is saying she is going for a conference with a guy who she is working as an office secretary. she once told me that this guy is super rich and spends most of her outside the office time with him. she is claiming that she is paying for it all herself and that she is even going to do a solo trip on her own when its very clear its her boss paying for it all and will be there with her for the entire trip.

the place she is going is london. and i have lived in london and know that its a very costly place to live. her trip will last for a whole month and even i have never taken a trip for that long or afford to do so. I know it shouldn't matter what she does with her life but somehow it makes me really angry that she is copying me but not admitting that unlike me she is not earning this trip on her own money or hard work.

I feel like directly asking her if her boss is paying for everything and if she is making the whole conference and solo thing up just to copy me. will i be an asshole if i ask her this? or even thinking this? am i wrong here?"

yaldny_3738,yaldny,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"My ex and I where together for a year. Prior to that we where friends for a year. We broke up at the start of April.

When we broke up we continued to stay on contact until the end of June. She slept with someone else and I mentally wasn’t in a good place to see her with someone new while I wasn’t over her and stopped messaging and responding as much.

Then mid August she reached out. We spoke for a while and both admitted to still having feelings. While my feeling weren’t as strong knowing she still had feelings made me want to try again.

We tried the entire of September and kept having petty arguments over things that we could’ve fixed if we sat down and spoke about them. This sucked as by the end of September my feelings had fully returned for her as I was no longer denying them.

She finally ended fixing things by telling me she had feelings for someone else as well as feelings for me and wasn’t ready to jump into a relationship again and that we should be friends and see what happens.

I did question how being friends and seeing what happens differs from straight up fixing things and she told me that the term fixing things made her feel pressured into a relationship when she isn’t ready.

I said I understood and that while I’m happy to do that if she meets someone else depending on how long it’s been I may need time.

A couple of days later she called me crying. Said she had feelings for the guy she slept with after we broke up and they had been together briefly but it hadn’t worked out as she still has feelings for me. However, she walked in on him in bed with someone else and it hurt her as she didn’t expect that and had been crying since it happened.

Last night we where talking and she mentioned going to a bar with a few friends and family until she posted a photo of her and that guy together with his arm around her and another of them in his house together. It hurt as after what he done she was willing to try with him again or was at least meeting up with him.

I sent her a message saying I wish her the best and that right now while I have feelings for her I cannot be her friend and that I can’t be a shoulder to cry on if this guy does anything bad to her. I removed her off Snapchat but told her if she was ever in trouble she had my phone number and I’d be willing to talk.

Today she messaged calling me an asshole for what I said and that I knew she wasn’t in a good place and they where just friends and I couldn’t be angry over her seeing him as we weren’t together. I tried to explain that due to us agreeing to fix things my feelings for her had came back and while I want to be there for her mentally I couldn’t at this moment.

I, 15f, have a bf, 14m, and we have been dating for a few months now but recently his dad has been questioning him about my existence. My bf was always so hesitant about wanting to tell his dad that he had a gf but when the truth came out, his dad tried to force him to break up with me. His father told him either leave me, or he’s changing his schools so he never sees me again. Of course, when i found this out, I was heartbroken as I have never had an actual conversation with his dad and was highly confused on why he couldn’t let his son see me anymore. Im very open about this topic and have talked to my bf, family, and friends and they seem to share the same opinion. My bf has rights to see whoever he pleases as long as it’s reasonable. Although my bf agrees with this, he still refuses to stand up to his father about the way he feels. He continues to try and make plans to go out with me or come see but we both know that will never happen. This topic has caused a few arguments between us. In one, he said that it was too much if a bother to stand up for what he wants and that he doesnt feel like it. Of course, this set me off. In heat of the moment, I said “That ‘I dont feel like it’ shit is why our relationship wont last long. I refuse to date someone who wont make as much of an effort as I do” I Dont regret saying that as its true but I do love him and really want our relationship to work out. I just feel as that him, as an almost grown man, should be able to make decisions for himself. AITAH?

Edit: I seen a few questions and comments asking “well why doesnt he want u dating his son” or comments like “you must not like being told no” 
Yes, i dont like being told no but over time, ive learned to shut up and take it. His father never really made it clear to either one of us to why he’s trying to make his son leave me. The only reason he gave us was that ‘attachment is bad’ and ‘you’ll know when your older’

After explaining the situation to family because i felt as if i was the A-hole in the situation, they dont find it to be reasonable either but I know there isnt much for us to do about it but to continue to go as we already have. On the topic of not wanting his child to become a young dad, i dont feel that would be possible in anyway. We only see each other at school, the times we would be together at my house, it was for school and we were surrounded by my parents and other family members.

ybgnem_3771,ybgnem,op-engaged,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I'm 31(F) and my husband is 32. We've been married for 4 years. He's an only child who his mom had after several miscarriages (basically a miracle baby). His parents' marriage was always weird according to him as they had never seemed affectionate and he was always more attached to his mother. He has some issues with his father as he claims he didn't try to spend much time with him. His mom basically used to tell him stories about the bad things his father had done to her and claimed she was just telling so he could learn that no matter how badly ppl treat you, you should love. This made him resent his dad. Fast forward to college. We met, started dating and decide to get married after 3 1/2 years. He's very timid and afraid to push ahead for anything (bcuz his mom kept telling him how his dad keeps going after crazy business ideas and they always fail so he has a fear of being like his dad-always failing). I, on the other hand am a risk taker and will push to achieve a goal. I decided I wouldn't let his timid ways be an issue bcuz i would help him.
When we were to get married, we decided to have a very small wedding (just family and a 2 person wedding party) bcuz we didn't want to spend big. We BOTH agreed to this and even went to check out a small venue. In the midst of our plans, his mom claimed she wanted it to be done at her church where he grew up. She even cried and said the wedding date we were planning to use was too sudden and ""people would talk"" so my then fiance changed the date and told me he couldn't handle seeing his mom crying. (RED FLAG#1) I went along thinking ""I'm not his wife yet so I can't really go against her.""

 The wedding was a disaster bcuz we had it at their church which is a converted warehouse. The decorator who my mom got was awful and made a mess of things. I hated the day. Once almost a year after I spent the night crying looking at the pictures and when he woke up I was telling him how badly I felt about the wedding and how his and my mom's meddling ruined the day. He was rushing to get to a function she was hosting so he pretty much told me to get over it and ignored me after that. I shouted that he shouldn't dismiss me bcuz I spend nights awake upset over what he allowed to happen and I could've killed him in his sleep. (MY RED FLAG) (This was just to get his attention) and i know that was waaaay out of line and creepy. He told me to get out of the house that day and I did. I ended up moving back in after apologizing and explaining that I just wanted him to stop ignoring me. To this day I regret saying that.

So, we're married..he has a custom of doing Morning devotions with his mom at 4 am. He wanted us to do the same. I hate waking up early and he knew this from college days. I asked if we could meet in the middle and do 6 am. He didn't want to do that and asked his mom to come and speak to me. They sat on ether side of me in the couch and this woman had to nerve to ask me if I can maybe get up at 5. I asked why I was being tag teamed and why she knew what was happening in our home. She left with no apology. (RED FLAG #2)
On Valentine's Day 1 year after we got married, my mom came knocking frantically at our door needing to use the bathroom. She's diabetic and on diuretic pills so she pees often. He was annoyed by the way she came knocking. I understood his feelings, but he said his mom would never do that to which I responded ""um...your mom literally has a key that you gave her and came here while we were at work, inspected the place and commented on how dirty my back patio was when she saw me at church the next Sunday."" He then decided he didn't want to go out for V-day bcuz,  in his words ""I had the nerve to compare my mom to his"" (RED FLAG #3)
2 years later, her husband had an affair and had a baby. She was understandably devastated, but her way of getting revenge was to have him thrown out of the organization they own and taking over even though she's not qualified. I told him I can't join them on that bcuz it won't end well bcuz God wouldn't be pleased with that. He flipped and told me I wasn't Christian enough to talk about his mom. He continued to defend her actions and whenever I would refuse to be a part of it, he would point out my flaws and tell me she was better than I am. 
During this time i started begging him to let us buy a house together bcuz i was scared he would put e out again if anything went wrong. I needed the security. He had every excuse. He even had a property in some far away area where neither of us wanted to live. I begged him to sell it so we could make a downpayment on a home in the city and he gave several excuses for not being able to do so. I got fed up and started looking at buying one by myself. When i did find one, i showed it to him and he said it looked like a good investment so I went ahead and bought it solo. After a while, he switched up and said he didn't want me to buy the house, but it was already too  late. He started getting really disgusting and refused to help me even carry a bucket of paint to the house. I didn't bother him. I just did what I had to do. One day late last year, I refused to sleep with him bcuz he was still prioritizing his mom over me and trying to spite me for buying the house and I was over it. I gave him an ultimatum: Me or her. He told me I could go live in the house I bought then..in other words..get out. I did. 2 weeks later he moves her into the apartment and they're living happily. (RED FLAG #4 AND FINAL STRAW). I went there to get something I had left and there she was telling me to remove the frozen stuff I had left in the fridge (the fridge I had bought with my money) and he said nothing. I called him that evening to ask if this is what he wanted and he said he couldn't give me an answer. I knew what that meant so I decided to move on. I got with my ex fiance. A month later, here comes my husband claiming he wants to work things out. I told him what was happening and he flipped saying I cheated on him and that's why he loves his mom more. 
AITA for moving on so quickly? Should I have waited for him to come to his senses?

Edit: It's been a few months since this all happened and I tried to work ot out. We ended up separated again and he went back to stay with mommy. I found out that he sold the same property as soon as we split and used the money to finish a multi family home that she had been building. It's  an income earner so he has provided a stable retirement plan for her. Smh. When I asked him he told me he preferred to build a house with her because he can trust her. ( NB I have NEVER taken money from this man w/o paying him back). I give up on him. They're  clearly in love with each other."

He's very timid and afraid to push ahead for anything (bcuz his mom kept telling him how his dad keeps going after crazy business ideas and they always fail so he has a fear of being like his dad-always failing). I, on the other hand am a risk taker and will push to achieve a goal. I decided I wouldn't let his timid ways be an issue bcuz i would help him.
When we were to get married, we decided to have a very small wedding (just family and a 2 person wedding party) bcuz we didn't want to spend big. We BOTH agreed to this and even went to check out a small venue. In the midst of our plans, his mom claimed she wanted it to be done at her church where he grew up. She even cried and said the wedding date we were planning to use was too sudden and ""people would talk"" so my then fiance changed the date and told me he couldn't handle seeing his mom crying. (RED FLAG#1) I went along thinking ""I'm not his wife yet so I can't really go against her.""

 The wedding was a disaster bcuz we had it at their church which is a converted warehouse. The decorator who my mom got was awful and made a mess of things. I hated the day. Once almost a year after I spent the night crying looking at the pictures and when he woke up I was telling him how badly I felt about the wedding and how his and my mom's meddling ruined the day. He was rushing to get to a function she was hosting so he pretty much told me to get over it and ignored me after that. I shouted that he shouldn't dismiss me bcuz I spend nights awake upset over what he allowed to happen and I could've killed him in his sleep. (MY RED FLAG) (This was just to get his attention) and i know that was waaaay out of line and creepy. He told me to get out of the house that day and I did. I ended up moving back in after apologizing and explaining that I just wanted him to stop ignoring me. To this day I regret saying that.

So, we're married..he has a custom of doing Morning devotions with his mom at 4 am. He wanted us to do the same. I hate waking up early and he knew this from college days. I asked if we could meet in the middle and do 6 am. He didn't want to do that and asked his mom to come and speak to me. They sat on ether side of me in the couch and this woman had to nerve to ask me if I can maybe get up at 5. I asked why I was being tag teamed and why she knew what was happening in our home. She left with no apology. (RED FLAG #2)
On Valentine's Day 1 year after we got married, my mom came knocking frantically at our door needing to use the bathroom. She's diabetic and on diuretic pills so she pees often. He was annoyed by the way she came knocking. I understood his feelings, but he said his mom would never do that to which I responded ""um...your mom literally has a key that you gave her and came here while we were at work, inspected the place and commented on how dirty my back patio was when she saw me at church the next Sunday."" He then decided he didn't want to go out for V-day bcuz,  in his words ""I had the nerve to compare my mom to his"" (RED FLAG #3)
2 years later, her husband had an affair and had a baby. She was understandably devastated, but her way of getting revenge was to have him thrown out of the organization they own and taking over even though she's not qualified. I told him I can't join them on that bcuz it won't end well bcuz God wouldn't be pleased with that. He flipped and told me I wasn't Christian enough to talk about his mom. He continued to defend her actions and whenever I would refuse to be a part of it, he would point out my flaws and tell me she was better than I am. 
During this time i started begging him to let us buy a house together bcuz i was scared he would put e out again if anything went wrong. I needed the security. He had every excuse. He even had a property in some far away area where neither of us wanted to live. I begged him to sell it so we could make a downpayment on a home in the city and he gave several excuses for not being able to do so. I got fed up and started looking at buying one by myself. When i did find one, i showed it to him and he said it looked like a good investment so I went ahead and bought it solo. After a while, he switched up and said he didn't want me to buy the house, but it was already too  late. He started getting really disgusting and refused to help me even carry a bucket of paint to the house. I didn't bother him. I just did what I had to do. One day late last year, I refused to sleep with him bcuz he was still prioritizing his mom over me and trying to spite me for buying the house and I was over it. I gave him an ultimatum: Me or her. He told me I could go live in the house I bought then..in other words..get out. I did. 2 weeks later he moves her into the apartment and they're living happily. (RED FLAG #4 AND FINAL STRAW). I went there to get something I had left and there she was telling me to remove the frozen stuff I had left in the fridge (the fridge I had bought with my money) and he said nothing. I called him that evening to ask if this is what he wanted and he said he couldn't give me an answer. I knew what that meant so I decided to move on. I got with my ex fiance. A month later, here comes my husband claiming he wants to work things out. I told him what was happening and he flipped saying I cheated on him and that's why he loves his mom more. 
AITA for moving on so quickly? Should I have waited for him to come to his senses?

Edit: It's been a few months since this all happened and I tried to work ot out. We ended up separated again and he went back to stay with mommy. I found out that he sold the same property as soon as we split and used the money to finish a multi family home that she had been building. It's  an income earner so he has provided a stable retirement plan for her. Smh. When I asked him he told me he preferred to build a house with her because he can trust her. ( NB I have NEVER taken money from this man w/o paying him back). I give up on him. They're  clearly in love with each other."
ybk3ht_3778,ybk3ht,op-engaged,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,"My MIL lives less than 10 minutes down the road from me. At first I was so happy. She and my eldest son had a great bond. She would have him over to spend the night once every few months. I had twin newborns at home, once they got older she would take one kid at a time to do activities about once a month or so.
I thought she was doing what she could to help me. I was grateful. 

Then my SIL had a baby. My kids only exist on holidays now. All of a sudden my MIL is over at my SIL's house cleaning, gardening, babysitting if her daughter wants to do literally anything. She's cooking for them, bringing them treats and inviting them over to have pizza and movie nights.

My SIL works, I'm a stay at home homeschooling mom and I run a small business. I watched my Nephew and then Niece once she was born from said SIL during the shift overlap of my SIL and BIL. (Until I asked to get paid, then I was 'fired'.) 
My MIL started to get Thursdays off at her work, so she invited my SIL over from the moment she wakes up to spend the whole day over there as free babysitting, she gets to nap, and she gets to eat lunch and dinner there and gets a lunch packed for her night shift job. They call it Grandma Day. 

After four years my now four kids are wondering why only their cousins get Grandma Day. 
My husband and I talked, it really bothers him that his mother treats his sister like a princess, but treats him like he only exists if he can do something for her. We agree to give her one last chance and to spread it all out for her to see our side. (We've tried before, but she always changes the conversation)
We tell her about the kid's asking about having a Grandma Day. She looks aghast. Says she has no more time to give. I said I'm not asking for an additional day, but that my kids love her and we could go every other week and take turns. She shuts me down right away. Says she's probably not going to do Grandma Day anyway as she's getting too busy. (This was Easter, not one Grandma Day has been missed except for vacation, which she went with them on to babysit)
She was disgusted I asked, but I don't think it's fair to my kids. I'm not asking even half of what she's freely offering to my SIL. I feel like she's punishing me and my kids for me being a stay at home mom. My choice, my consequence. But my sister in law works. Shouldn't that be her choice her consequence?
Now they (My MIL, her two daughters and my BIL) are all treating us like we were the AH for asking."

For the second wedding I wasn't in the same financial situation I was previously so therefore I could only afford a much cheaper present, I gave them money so they could put it towards whatever they wanted. She rang and texted me very upset and annoyed because I didn't pay for her 2nd honeymoon (never said I was going too) and they hadn't booked anything.

ybyc3r_3806,ybyc3r,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,"Recently one of my brothers got engaged and decided to have the bachelor party overseas - we all live in the U.S. 

Now my wife and I don’t make a ton of money and we have two kids. Under any other circumstance, I probably wouldn’t go but this is most likely the last bachelor party I will ever have the pleasure of experiencing and it’s my brother’s party, not a friend. I did the math and if I work some overtime over the course of several months I can get the trip paid for.

As soon as my wife heard where the guys were going she immediately said she is going as well as she has always wanted to experience the country we are going to. I told her that it’s a bachelor party and I wouldn’t entertain having her tag along. We can’t afford two tickets overseas and it would be awkward having her around the guys even though we aren’t doing anything over the top like strip clubs, etc. She said she wouldn’t hang around us and she would be happy to enjoy the time by herself. I told her that’s not going to work because I would be worried about her the entire time being that no one is with her.

My wife is pissed she can’t go to the point where I’m considering not even going. Even if I do go, I’ll have to deal with a pissed off wife when I get back and if I don’t go, I’ll miss out on a great experience with my brothers but not have to deal with a pissed off wife.

Some of my wife’s friends are saying that I’m being childish and to let her go - am AITAH here?

EDIT: I appreciate the comments below but it’s definitely apparent that I need to provide some details:

I love my wife and I trust her 100%. I don’t want her to be alone in a different country due to how physically small she is. She could easily be overpowered by almost anyone. She’s also damn good looking too IMO.

Nearly all of the bachelor party members are single or aren’t married and all of them have expressed interest in going overseas. What makes it easier for me to afford this trip is because there are A LOT of expenses that can be split between the entire group (hotel, ground transportation, etc). 

My wife would not have to worry about my behavior in the slightest for those suggesting that she might. My days of getting hammered are way past me and I would not want to get blacked out in a foreign country for obvious reasons.

Someone watching the kids would not be an issue. We have family around that could watch the kids. If something were to happen to one of our kids, I would much rather my wife be there instead of both of us being across the Atlantic.

My wife can’t work overtime - she has a salary.

LAST EDIT: Thank you for the comments and suggestions. I’m leaning towards saving up for a separate trip for my wife and I to both enjoy our time together while overseas.

To the people below who suggested I am controlling and would even have the urge to cheat on my wife while overseas, go fuck yourselves."

My dad is an alcoholic and slightly abusive, while my mum is a control freak who keeps a very tight leash around my neck. I have brought up the topic of me moving out several times around my mum, and each time it ends up with her shouting at me and me crying. 

Today was no different, but after a small argument with my sister (11F), my mum got involved and that pissed me off, because I thought I was handling it well. I went to my bedroom to cry, and heard my parents talking from the kitchen. The conversation went something like this, but do keep in mind i haven’t mentioned anything to my dad about moving out:
Dad: “does she want to move out?”
Mum: *says something incoherent*
Dad: “does she want to move out though?”
Mum: “maybe.”
me, opening my door and yelling down the hallway: “the maybe is definitely yes!”
Dad: “well if she wants to go, then why doesn’t she just fucking leave? it’s not like anyone in this house actually wants her around anyway, she’s an ungrateful bitch.”

My dad has said some very mean stuff, and I’ve been called names on multiple occasions, but those words that my dad said just broke me. I just sat against my door and sobbed silently, so hard I couldn’t breathe. 

I then called my best friend, who told me that I should stop invalidating myself and leave. When I have brought up moving out in the past, my mum has always mocked me by saying how bad of a home life I have and how I don’t have any food to eat and all this other shit that is basically making me feel like shit for having some things other kids don’t, which is why I was doubting myself in the first place. But then my bsf said that if she was getting treated like that she would leave herself, which finally gave me the push.

So, i’ve packed up my essentials, messaged my few close friends, and prepared to leave at midnight with a few things to live in my car for a couple nights. I have to go to school tomorrow, so I have everything i need in my school bag as well. The time is 9:54 pm when I am writing this, so when I am safe I might do an update if anyone cares.

I don’t have a job or any money, but I have applied in several places and are hoping I can get a relatively good source of income. Fingers crossed everything turns out okay.

yc88ua_3818,yc88ua,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Okay context I'm 15 and my sister L is 21. L has 2 jobs And is in trade school with a house she bought with her boyfriend. My father has been a deadbeat since I was born he struggled through depression that my mother couldn't handle so she divorced him and got custody. My dad would pay only 30 dollars in child support a week for 3 kids and now he still pays only 30 but for 2 kids.

Once my sister moved out I decided to get Disney plus using the child support money under my mother's Gmail cause I knew everyone has her info and it would be easier to allow people to use it. My sister's all the way to my grandparents they all have my Disney account.

Up till recently my sister decided she wanted to change the Gmail account without talking to anyone and she did, with my card still paying Disney I didn't care cause I had the password to that account and when I asked why she changed it she just shrugged and said she didn't like having our mother's Gmail on it.

Then up she changed the Disney password and her Gmail password kicking me out of Disney. My sister and I were never really close and we would always pick fights I asked her for the Disney account log in info because mine isn't working and that I'm annoyed that she keeps changing it. She told me no and that I already have the info and she's not going to tell me.

My father has been a deadbeat since I was born he struggled through depression that my mother couldn't handle so she divorced him and got custody. My dad would pay only 30 dollars in child support a week for 3 kids and now he still pays only 30 but for 2 kids.

Once my sister moved out I decided to get Disney plus using the child support money under my mother's Gmail cause I knew everyone has her info and it would be easier to allow people to use it. My sister's all the way to my grandparents they all have my Disney account.

Up till recently my sister decided she wanted to change the Gmail account without talking to anyone and she did, with my card still paying Disney I didn't care cause I had the password to that account and when I asked why she changed it she just shrugged and said she didn't like having our mother's Gmail on it.

Then up she changed the Disney password and her Gmail password kicking me out of Disney. My sister and I were never really close and we would always pick fights I asked her for the Disney account log in info because mine isn't working and that I'm annoyed that she keeps changing it. She told me no and that I already have the info and she's not going to tell me.

True, the market is expensive. But it is for him and me, equally. 
We had a big fight about it. He blames me for everything. It was my decision to end our relationship, but i naively tought we could work it out like normal people do: ie share custody and coparent. 
But, he said that no, our daughter will be with me most of the time. Si i guess we will not be sharing custody after all. Not that i mind, i much prefer to have my daughter with me, its great. But I find it sad for her. 
Should i continue to insist he finds an apartment with 2 bedrooms? AITAH for asking for it? Should i let go?

I don't think he can stop. Our therapist asked why he got married and he shrugged.   I feel like he doesn't understand me at all. I don't talk much to him . He wants sex sex sex. Not just normal sex in a bed .like disgusting humiliating shit. We have two children under 3. Sex is the last thing I want right now especially after he slept with the human mattress.

He doesn't get it.i still am getting back to feeling like myself. I am done with dialysis but am still weak.I am going trick or treat with my friends our children and my sister. I am kind of looking forward for him being gone almost two weeks.

ycziye_3846,ycziye,top-comment,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"I, (25f) and my bf(27m) had a fight last night about his abortion comment. 1 week ago I had an abortion because he refused to marry me, and in my community having a kid un-married is unacceptable. I would be shunned by family and unsupported. He did not want to get married for various reasons. Some financial, some because our relationship has had some rough patches in the past year. I understood both sides and in the end had the abortion, and we stayed together. I regret it deeply, he knows this, but I felt like I had no choice if he was not going to marry me. I’ve been working on forgiving myself, and being okay with it all. Tonight we went out drinking and he had more than me since I was meant to be the designated driver. On the way home, he brought up the shared idea we once had about getting matching tattoos. I told him I would have done it had he done it. A few minutes into discussing tattoo ideas he said “if you had gotten my name tattooed like you offered, we could have kept the baby”. I was obviously shocked and taken back by what he said and started crying. He apologized profusely and said he knew he’d been saying a lot of not nice things tonight and he’s deeply sorry. We got home and I tried to be normal. I had a shower alone and cried it out. I came back and we started watching a movie. He kept trying to cuddle with me, hug and kiss me. I pulled  away and asked if we could just watch the movie. He got annoyed, apologized again and asked if we could drop it again while trying to cuddle. I pulled away and kept watching the movie. I said we could discuss it tomorrow. He offered to Uber eats me food but I declined because I was already full. I said if he likes we can go to brunch in the morning. He said if we go for brunch then we’re splitting the bill. (He’s not working right now). I didn’t say anything and kept watching the movie. The movie went on and he got incredibly annoyed that I didn’t forgive him and that I was still upset. I told him I have the right to be angry and he should not expect instant forgiveness just  because he apologized. 
He got frustrated, and left via Uber, even when I asked him not to. He lives down the street, 10 min away. I went over to his after an hour, crying, and asking why he would leave me after what he said.
He acted like he didn’t care, and told me to sleep, and asked if I came over just to argue. He then said he left because I was being disrespectful and that he’s not going to beg me for forgiveness.
TLDR: My boyfriend is upset I didn’t forgive him for a crude joke and that I gave him the cold shoulder.
AITA for not forgiving him right away and giving him the cold shoulder?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words and encouragement. It’s meant so much! I’ll try to love myself first. This is only the tip of the iceberg in the things I’ve been through with him. We’ve hurt each other a lot. But like some of you mentioned, I kept putting myself in a position to be hurt repeatedly, even when he told me he wasn’t good for me, and that I wasn’t what he wanted, I kept trying to prove myself and ended up hurting myself more. We broke up today and I’ll try to hold myself accountable and make sure this is the final time. I’ll be reading your comments for the much needed reminders. Thank u all :’)❤️"

She argues back saying that as long as I am under her roof her rules apply. Her boyfriend (42, male) makes almost every fight worse by joining her side and arguing that I’m being disrespectful.

After I said that she ran away crying and her boyfriend (J) yelled at me saying that I should treat her better because she raised me, he slapped me and walked away. I feel like its obvious that if she raised me and I’m acting up then it says something on her parenting. Ever since her boyfriend turned up and decided to move in we’ve had problems, including him being a pedophile when I was around 8-10 years old.

I talked to my dad (47,male) about moving in and he said he would see what his girlfriend (48,female) would say about me moving in as I could help around the house but would have to switch schools.

ydnz9w_3865,ydnz9w,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"A little back story: I (23f) and my stepmom Layla (57f) raised me and my brother ever since my parents divorced. I was 8 and Jayden was 2. My mother cheated with my stepfather who had kids from a previous marriage. My mom caused the divorce of my stepdad and his ex-wife. 

Side note: in my previous post I made a post about my mom and my dad fighting because my S/O Nick has severe anxiety attacks. That happened on the day that we have where we all act like a “family”.

Now onto what happened….

It was Jaydens 17th birthday and we went to this fancy restaurant and had a great time. It was me, Nick, my dad and my step mom and obviously my brother. Well we all were taking pictures and I thought I should take one of my step mom and post it. I did and in the caption it says “Layla is the best mother in the world”. Well my mom saw it and called me and I knew she was gonna yell at me which she did. She kept saying how dare I post that and how she isn’t my real mom and blah blah blah. She wanted me to take it down which I said no to. She kept on yelling till I finally hanged up on her. 

We all were having cake when my step siblings Julia and Ryan showed up. Boy was I not happy. They tried to reason with me into taking the post down. My mom had a 15 year old (Julia) and a 18 year old (Ryan) tell me a 23 year old what to do. I was utterly shocked but I said no and kicked them out. They left and I thought it was the end of it. 

Was it the end? No my mom decided to show up and yell at me and demanded I take the post down. I asked her then she should take down the posts that she has of her step kids which in the caption says “my two favorite kids in the whole world”. She said it was different and when I said again no she called me a asshole over a post (No I am not gonna post it here because it is for privacy reasons). Her husband showed up and started calling me every name in the book. Oh and her step kids showed up. They also called me an asshole. 

I told my family from my fathers side and they said I was in the right because my mom didn’t raise us Layla did. But some of the family from my moms side are angry at me and want me to delete the post. All showed up at my doorstep this morning. They said that they won’t leave me alone till I delete that post. 

Some info I want to add…Jayden decided to live with my mom for 2 years (he wanted to see what it’s like to live with my mom) but that happened when he was 10….she kicked him out when he was 12. I know she’s not a good mom…Layla raised Jayden like her own and she never did what my mom did (be neglectful).

ydsfka_3871,ydsfka,top-comment,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"My mother had just turned fifty. Me, my brother, and my father got her gifts and I baked her a cake. We had a celebration at home, but my mother's family lives three hours away from us, so they weren't there.

A few days later, mom said she's going to visit her family to celebrate her birthday, and that me and my brother should come with her. (She didn't bother asking my father, as he hates her family.) I refused to come with her, because I dread every one of these visits.

My grandma owns a big house, where we all stay when we're visiting. That means there's two of my aunts, three cousins, my grandmother, my grandfather, my brother, my mother, and me.

I have to share a room with my three cousins and my brother, so there's always something going on. I'm pretty introverted and it's emotionally draining me to not be alone for the whole week.

The worst thing is, they're not a pleasant company. My aunts and cousins are partially the reason of me hating my body and the way I look. Every time I visit my aunt says something like „Oh, you're still chubby."" and I remember my cousin asking me how much I weigh all the time. Overall, they just make me feel bad for every thing I do. I read a lot? Problem. I have curly hair? Problem. I have a pet snail? Problem. I dress in a crop top? Problem. I don't wear a dress? Problem. I don't shave? Problem. On top of that, all of them are pretty sexist and homophobic. And I'm a queer girl. Also, last time we visited, my grandmother slapped my brother in the face. I was there. and he did nothing to deserve it. My grandmother has no right to do that.

I haven't told my mother about any of this. I know she loves her family and I don't want her to be mad at them. I'm also afraid that she'll just brush me off.

So, this is the reason I refused to go to the birthday party. My mother said: „But it's my birthday."" I explained that I had already celebrated with her. Then, my father (who won't be going either) said me and my brother didn't care about our mother, because if we did, we would go with her. I still refused. My mother said that she'll give me work in our garden, but I honestly couldn't care less. It's far better to work than having to pretend your personality is a blank page. But maybe I'm just being overly sensitive, and I should do this for my mom. I feel guilty for disappointing her.

So am I the asshole?

I told her that I wasn’t ready to got that far with her and she said that it was fine and she wanted to be with me but she was going to find someone else to lose her virginity to.

I obviously wasn’t happy about that and said that if she didn’t want to wait for me then we should split up. I actually thought I was being quite mature about the situation but she thinks I am an AH for breaking up with her.

My ex tried to get back with me yesterday. She said she wasn’t a virgin anymore and wanted to help me lose my virginity. She had a girl in mind for me and then we could be together. Don’t know in what world she thinks that is ok. I asked her whether she used a condom and she said she did one time but not the next. She needed to feel the difference apparently. I swear she was never this stupid when we were together.

My parents have told me to get my things and get out of their house. They think I have slept with her now they know she’s not a virgin and have got her pregnant but trying to cover it up.

this whole thing started when i was 14(f) and my parents were getting married, my dad invited his friend from America (we live in England he moved from England to America when he was 16 and this is only the second time he's returned since) and immediately i got bad vibes from him. these feelings were confirmed shortly after when while walking through my kitchen near to my dads friend, he made a joke to me and then slapped my ass, i was obviously uncomfortable but didn't mention it to anyone at this point because i didn't know what to say. the next day i was taking a bath and out of sheer luck at this time i had stepped out to put on a skin exfoliator, while i was behind the door i see it slowly start to open (he used the same bathroom as me and my 13f sister while he stayed over)  i obviously panic, scream and slam the door shut and lock it but instead of hearing the man I'm going to nickname L apologize or explain that he didn't know anyone was in there , he fucking laughs. like this man full on chuckles and says 'yeah lock the door this time' in a voce i can only describe as condescending. i have a few problems with this before i go onto the next part #1 he was originally downstairs and we have a bathroom down there, literally right next to the stairs that he could've gone into #2 why did he open the door so slowly if he didn't know anyone was in there? like idk about u but i swing doors open quickly i don't slowly open them as if expecting someone to be on the other side and #3 i had shouted to my dad rather loudly when he asked me to grab some clothes 'im in the bath i cant right now' so unless this guy is fucking deaf i think he heard. it gets worse though because 2 days later my dad, older brother 17, L, my stepmother and my sister had all gone out and i decided to take a shower, while in there i got a feeling that something was wrong and when i looked around i realized that i had left my bathroom door unlocked so i quickly stepped out the shower and locked it. I'm not sure what compelled me to do this next part but i never ended up going back into the shower but i left it on while wrapping a towel around myself, a minute later i heard the door open indicating everyone was back and i heard my brother (i recognize his footsteps) running up the stairs and my bathroom door is attempted to be opened. no, he didn't try to open my bedroom door first, no he didn't knock, he just tried to barge straight in while being able to hear that i had the shower on. i screamed to my dad and told him what my brother had just tried to do, and he gave my brother a verbal 'what the fuck don't do that' but that was it. later on though i heard a conversation which I've never told anyone about but i don't think ill ever forget it, My brother: 'i got in trouble because of what you told me to do' m: 'oh she'll get over it women have to learn their place, why'd you think i didn't let (wife's name) come with me?' it doesn't take a genius to figure out who he was talking about when he said 'she'll get over it, women have to learn their place'

i pretty much ignored L the rest of his stay which luckily i could do until one incident where he had a bit too much to drink at my parents wedding and tried getting handsy but luckily i got away from that quickly.

skip forward to a few weeks ago I'm now 17 and my dad brought up the topic 'we were thinking about having L stay over for a bit again.' my dad knows about most of what happened when he came over last time and i brought this up to him and said i wouldn't be comfortable and if he did come over I'd have to find myself a place to stay where i didn't feel unsafe in my own home. my dad called me dramatic and said it's his best friend who would never do anything to me and he said being a drama queen wasn't going to get me anywhere but grounded. i called him an insensitive prick before running to my room and I've refused to speak to him since, if he does choose to let L come over again, I'm going to have to relocate because as much as i wish i could forget what happened last time i just can't and i dent care if that makes me selfish.

&amp;#x200B;

so AITAH for telling my dad I'm uncomfortable with his friend staying at our house again?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: i saw a couple people mention my mom (stepmom), i forgot to mention but after the bath incident i told her and she said she understands why i was uncomfortable and told my dad to have a chat with L about privacy but from what i know he never actually did. also, I did explain to my sister when this first happened a few years ago because I've always been close enough to tell her everything and she tried to walk away when i said 'i don't like L' but as it was only us two in the house i shouted up the stairs to her about what had appened and she went silent then said 'ill be carefu.' if he comes over i will most definately be bringing my sister with me or making sure she has a safe place to stay while L is in the house.

I had a damn nightmare (well to me it was) in my dream I found out my husband was still in contact with his ex and I got a little damn upset when I woke up (not gonna lie I was beyond pissed)
Anyways later that day A mutual friend told me my husband was talking to his ex still and she was taking long replying so me being a psycho I creeped up on her Instagram and there I saw it (let’s say the baby’s name is Johnny  and middle name is bravo…
As soon as I saw that a mutual friend of mine and my husband told me that his ex’s named there baby with my oldest sons name (bravo) as her baby’s middle name… and my youngest has her baby’s first name(Johnny)
I told her nooo maybe it was a coincidence my husband was set in that name… this mutual friend said noooo! That they are in contact still and they planned it out… I’m so pissed!!
Honestly I can’t even stand to look at our baby’s face anymore… (I know I know it’s not my baby’s fault) but now all I see his his fkn ex when I see my baby now… I haven’t talked to my husband I’m 4 days and he’s wondering why I’m not talking to him.
But I’m planning on telling his ex’s fiancé soon with the screenshots of our mutual friends conversation with her! 
And well my husband all I can say is fuck you and I’m currently in the process of trying to change his name…
Will I be the asshole if I do this?

******************************************************
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just about 5 minutes ago he came in the room and asked me what was wrong and that I haven’t talked to him in almost a week
I just flat out told him that our mutual friend that I’m keeping anonymous told me she talked to his ex because she thought it was weird that she gave our first sons name to her baby as his middle name and that it’s weired that our new baby has the same name as her baby 
He told me “ that just had too be a coincidence “
She told me that his ex did indeed say that they still keep in contact on Snapchat smfh
He ended up denying that saying that he doesn’t keep tabs on her cause he’s “a married man now” and she isn’t important and blah blah blah 
So I told him to show me his Snapchat and type her name in so I can be sure he refused to do so and came back after 5 minutes and said “okay I’ll show you” I told him he didn’t need to because by now she would of been removed in not stupid 
I did infect contact the court yesterday and asked if it’s possible to change my baby’s name they told me I would need him to sign paperwork as well to have it changed I told them by the situation of what happened they said if he’s on the birth certificate then he will indeed need to be sign the paper work and pay a fee… 
I  ended up telling his ex’s fiancé and he said “no she would never do that she’s with me”  I told him check her shit and come back to me he never told me Anything back I ended up telling my friend send him the fkn screen shots which she did
I’m honestly so pissed and my husband is already  taking about baby number 4 and I just had enough of her thinks having another baby was going to fix this 
But you know what if we do I’m naming that baby Juan José Jamal Jeremy jr I will name that baby with all of my exes so when he sees that baby he can be reminded by all of the guys who fucked me raw and I walked away 
I’m in the process of packing some clothes of mine and my kids and and staying at my parents house for a few weeks 
My husband is pretty fucking stupid and still hasn’t realized that I put up cameras around the house yet and it’s been 3 weeks because with our baby I’m always in the bedroom and I use the cameras to keep tabs on our other kids

yenp6r_3905,yenp6r,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Title basically says it all. Throw away account. So I see many people make these but I never thought I’d be typing one out. My in laws are your typical entitled people who think the world owes them something. I have been trying to set better boundaries with them and not see them on a whim (whenever they demand to) and I thought it was going well. Until one day we went to the park together. My (26f) husband (30m) and his siblings (sister 29f , brother 33m) we’re also there along with my mil (55f). My sils 2 young children as well as my 1 yo daughter was also there. My sil decides to confront me and demand we go for a walk. I told her you’re scaring me did something happen? Then her mood changed like a light switch and she became all chirpy and said no no I just wanna talk. So I said you can talk here in front of everyone. She begins to ask me what’s wrong with me and I’ve been quiet etc. at this point my mil also came and sat down and my husband was next to me. She kept making excuses for my answers. Eg she’d ask why haven’t we seen you? Me: I’ve been tired lately. Sil: we’re ALL tired babe get over I’ve got 2 kids you’ve only got 1 blah blah blah. They didn’t allow me to get a word in. Then my sil says to mil come on mum you say your part too. Ahh I see a planned ambush? No problem. Then my mil says we want you around more often you never call us or make plans with us we wanna see more of your daughter etc. I said oh,well why didn’t you guys contact me if you wanted to see us? And they both said because it’s my responsibility to contact them. I said I can’t read your mind you need to let me know too. Anyway things pretty much escalated. Mil started lying saying she always calls me (my husband knows she never does). So I stood up and said I don’t need to sit here and be disrespected by you guys, if you don’t even like me on a basic human level how can I believe you guys love my daughter as much as you say? They found this EXTREMELY offensive and started screaming yelling at me again. At this point my husband is even telling them to back off and stop attacking me (which is surprising because he’s mr neutral). So then when I stood up my sil yanked my arm down very roughly. I shrugged her off and stood up again and gathered my things in the pram with my daughter in my arms (note: she was facing away from me while I held her). All of a sudden my sil completely attacks me screaming don’t disrespect my mum at the top of her lungs. There are heaps of kids present including hers because it was a sunny day. But I was still holding my daughter when she attacked me and she got hurt. My husband and bil broke her off me she then turned towards my pram and kicked it to the ground, damaging it. She then fell to the ground having a complete mental breakdown and was crying. We left the park. I have never in my life been in a physical fight. I’m a very calm and patient person- everybody knows this. But this was the last straw. I should mention I did say to my sister in law you’re a stupid slut after she attacked me. When we got in the car my husband said I swore at his sister. Then later on his family accused me of yelling and swearing at them which my husband said it’s not true as he was there too. 4 weeks have past and now they want me to “get over it” and be “closer than ever”. My husband agrees with them. They also don’t want to see me until I’m over it but want to see my daughter. I said no because I fear for her safety because of what his sil is capable of. My husband said don’t you trust me I’m going to be there? But I said no because he was also at the park and didn’t exactly protect us plus pointed out my mistakes straight away. My husband is known for being pushed around by his family and they always get their way with him even at my and our daughters expense. I don’t want them to see my daughter ESPECIALLY without me, AITA?"
yeptdu_3916,yeptdu,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,"GF and I have been dating for 4 years. No major arguments.

So my GF and I were playing a game a couple of days ago where we had to pick who we would save between two loved ones if it were a life or death situation. We were playing the game using friends' names and some relatives. After a couple of rounds, I started asking my GF who she would pick between me and some of her relatives. I know she isn't super close to her relatives, so wasn't particularly surprised that she chose me over them consistently. I then asked who she would choose between me and her cat.

She thought for a couple of seconds, then responded that she'd pick her cat over me. She said that she's had her cat since it was a baby and that it has only known her all its life (9 years old). I reminded her that we were discussing a life or death situation. E.g. if we were both dr0wning and she had to pick one. She said it would be beyond cruel to let her cat dr0wn especially because it wouldn't understand why she let it drown. I asked whether she felt the same way if we were both stranded in a burning house and there was only the choice to save one. She said she loves me but couldn't let her cat die in a fire quoting the same reason. I then asked who she would pick between if her cat and I needed a life saving operation but she only had money for one. She said her cat has been in her life longer, has been there through tough times and she couldn't let her cat die. 

I was upset at her responses and went home. I fully understand loving one's pet, but is it wrong to expect your partner to make you their priority? I consistently chose her when the questions were reversed on me about whom I would pick between. Granted, I don't have a pet. But I felt like there was no point in continuing a relationship with someone who clearly didn't value me as a partner, so I broke up with her via phone call yesterday morning. She is upset and so am I. She asked me to take some time to think things over.

Some friends say I'm TA as a pet is like a child. Others say I'm not TA as it's not unreasonable to expect a partner to make you their priority. 

So AITA?"

I was over the moon with joy and so where my parents and siblings, well most of my siblings. My sister Katelyn. She has wanted kids forever but recently found out that she can’t give birth. I felt so bad for but it doesn’t mean she can get jealous for me having kids? A few months after that incident was  the baby shower and I invited everyone. Including Katelyn. When she arrived she seemed happy and I tried to believe she was being kind for once in her Life but no I was wrong. We all went outside and did a countdown from 10 and Me and my husband  popped the ballon! We were having a baby boy! I was so happy .while everyone was congratulating us she went over to the food section and completely trashed it. Throwing and tossing food and desserts everywhere. I was absolutely furious. I told all the guests  to leave and had A COMPLETE FIT and Katelyn . Screaming and tossing stuff she was also yelling at me , she tried to grab my hair but lucky for her mum pulled us apart . I told her to get the fuck out of my house and she left.

My sister came over to congratulate me and I was happy that she was happy for me:). A week later I returned home and went to bed . The next day.

This might seem like a big favour but can I have one of you babies . You know I can’t have babies and if you did this for me I Would always treasure it. I stood up in disbelief , I felt as if a bullet had been shoot right through my heart.What kind of silly question is that Katelyn? I asked , she then said  I know It’s a big deal but I’m your little sister and it would be a dream come true if you let me ha- NO I said with a firm voice interrupting her. Don’t ask me such a stupid question. She r ose slowly from her seat with tears forming in her eyes . No? She questioned….. I thought you were my sister and that you loved me but I guess I was wrong. I do love you but you know it’s always been my dream to have twins and it you were a real sister you wouldn’t want to take that away from me. BUT I WANT A CHILD THATS MY OWN BLOOD she then yelled at me. I told her to quiet down as the kids were sleeping. She apologised and agreed to quiet down .

Definitely pedo vibes🙁!” I responded to her comment calmly saying “I think you might think I just turned 17 but I turn 18 in 1 month” she then responded to  by saying “idc how old you are that boy is grooming you &amp; needs to be arrested !” I ignored her comment but she continued to comment back to back so I finally snapped I responded to her comment saying “ me and that boy were literally in hs together at some point ! There is nothing wrong with what we’re doing especially since the legal age of consent in my area is 17, please get off my page before I tweak out on this clock app” she then responded “don’t be mad because your sneaky link likes Children 😂” I went on her page and seen that her mom and dad are OVER 10 years apart. I responded to her comment saying”your parents are over a decade a part and they’re still together? Don’t think that’s a little groomish on your dad’s  behalf?” Before she can even respond to my comment I followed up by saying “if me sneaky linking with a man that’s only 3 years older then me is such a crime then lock your child loving father up as well!” She then blocked me. 



So AITA?"

His daughter has always been a picky eater. We have tried many different methods of getting her to eat new foods which for the most part fails and ends with one of us cooking an entirely different meal for her every night just to make sure she eats something. The problem came when I decided to stop trying to get her to eat what she doesn’t like and just make her favorite foods for her to eat which comes down to a specific type of beans, baked potato, chicken nuggets, and spaghetti. As of recently she has started refusing to eat even her favorite foods taking two bites and leaving the table only to come back later and ask for junk food. I brought up to my boyfriend how it makes me feel unappreciated to go out of my way to make her a different meal to eat everyday from the one we would be eating only for her to throw it away without trying much to eat it and how I would like for him to put a stop to it because I feel it is getting out of hand. Every time I bring up the topic he chews me out making me feel as if I’m in the wrong and like I’m attacking her because she’s “only 8 years old” now I’m considering refusing to cook her a different meal and making him do it every time it’s time for her to eat if she won’t eat the original meal that was made. She doesn’t have any allergies or dietary restrictions to the food and they are good meals that range from various pastas, meats, and vegetables. Would I be the ah if I made him cook her separate meals from this point forward?

Edit: I’ve considered the sensory thing but i know she loves spaghetti so Ive tried making different variations of that like Alfredo spaghetti with chicken and she doesn’t eat it. The only things she would eat is exactly what’s listed in the post. Any slight change and she’ll sit there and stare at it until her dad lets her throw it away. The only time I’ve see her eat anything different is when dad wasn’t around and I didn’t let her get up from the table until she ate her burger then she eventually gave in and ate it (even said it was good but won’t touch it when dad is around). This is why I don’t think it’s a sensory thing. Also want to mention that I am only considering this route because when I suggest other solutions such as not rewarding her with junk food if she doesn’t eat I usually get shut down and I get the “you’re not her actual parent so you don’t really have a say” speech"

My brother has already been married because before I was speaking to my mother the other day regarding the wedding invitation that we all received come to find out that my brother is still married to his ex-wife and never actually filed the paperwork. I reached out to my brother and explain my concerns I told him it's best to get the paperwork started before they start planning a wedding that way the soon to be bride does not get upset when there's issues while trying to file their new paperwork. He assured me that everything was fine and they were getting everything together leading up to this wedding. After a few days is soon to be wife sends out a list of rules and restrictions that all guests must follow from: we cannot be drinking before the ceremony we have to bring our own chairs ,we have to bring our own liquor, we cannot bring kids under the age of three .I have a son and he's almost four  and autistic . And that we would not be allowed to take pictures until they are ready to do so of any kind. I cannot bring extra guest ,unless I notify them first which I'm okay with but if I'm bringing my husband there should be no question in that of an extra guest. Now again she posted this on Facebook where anyone in her friends list could comment on this .I told her that this would not be reasonable especially considering that we are coming from out of state and don't get me wrong I would love to attend but those rules and restrictions are bit much. This is where she messaged me in messenger so that way no one else could read the comments and saying that I was being a little bit rude saying she's concerned about my son being autistic and understands that we are coming from here and there and I told her look I understand it's your day but you're asking a lot from your guests. She had became upset with me and trying to make me seem like the bad guy I simply told her since I know that my brother has not been divorced yet that the wedding will not happen until he does so cuz legally he is still married in another state and therefore he cannot marry until they are divorced. She became so upset  she started to bash on my wedding since I got married at a courthouse and saying that at least she doesn't plan on having that type of wedding and then proceeded to Uninvited me to the wedding from their wedding unfriended me on Facebook and then  to call my brother and him message me saying what did I do to upset her .am I the a-hole because I simply wouldn't follow rules/ restrictions with a wedding that's out of state , them asking their guests to bring so much stuff and do so much for them while they act like I'm the one asking a lot. And again he still currently married in another state. AitaH? 
Edit * the rules were public she messaged me privately after I declined going and several other people also declined that were on her friends list my family do not drink heavily and understand that we normally would wait for a reception but she put it in the rules that no one is allowed to drink before the reception that we also had to bring our own chairs we couldn't bring a plus one unless verified I understand that my child is autistic I do not mind that she has concerns over my child and her wedding but she is stating that everyone including me cannot have any kids either under the age of three or over the age of three at the wedding which caused some concerns because obviously I would have to bring him considering that we would be out of state and I do not trust enough people to care for my son. There were so many rules that I could not list every single one as she also unfriended me so I do not have a copy of it. I simply told her I would not be to attend this wedding as she's asking too much from her gas and it would not be fun for us to come and try to support them on their special day when they're asking a lot. My brother yes is still married to this day to his ex-wife but they are still planning or have tried to got married knowing or a fact that he will be in a lot of trouble I express my concern to my brother because I do not want either of them to have issues while trying to be happy I express this to them and they brushed me off like it was not a concern. When she told me that he did not let her know until 2 months after they've already started making plans I was a little bit surprised and I told her and him simply the wedding could not be valid until all parties are divorced regardless if you're in another state or not. I told her that because of the rules I would simply not be able to go she got upset because I refuse to go and follow things that she wanted for the wedding I told her I understand fully where she's coming from but it seems a little bit drastic to have all these rules which now that I think of it one of them included that you are not supposed to be getting handsy feeling towards anyone or you'll be thrown out of the wedding which made me question what type of people she has attending to the wedding besides my family. My mother his father my sister and my other brothers agree with me that it's a bit extreme and they will also not be attending the wedding as well because of rules and things that they have to follow otherwise they will be either thrown out of the wedding again all parties are coming from out of state and we are expected to bring our own supplies for this wedding that they are hosting. And again I do not have a problem with bringing my son or the bride having an issue it's for the fact that she also has a child under the age of 1 years old with my brother but yet she does not want children at the wedding when I asked her who would be watching her child she said no my child is coming to the wedding to be a part of family that does not seem a bit Fair. Yes my kid is autistic but my kid can be in a public place in new surroundings without major issues if I feel that he is going to be removed then that would be on me and I would have no problem doing so. My brother messaged me immediately after this conversation with her and after she bashed my wedding which everyone in my family has been married at a courthouse including him on his first wedding she is being over dramatic I feel and she took it as that I no longer wanted to be part her friend group or anything in that matter. Then she proceeded to make a new invitation on Facebook yet again after uninviting me to the wedding and from her friends group and invited the rest of my family that also said that they were not going to attend singling me out away from any special events from my my brother or my niece. My brother by by the way did not tell me that I needed to apologize to her but he simply said that he was taking care of the paperwork I reminded him again that there could not be a wedding unless he is fully divorced he's still ignoring me. I feel that I am not the a** because I told her I am happy for them but I just want to make sure that their wedding goes smoothly and wish them the best again politely announced publicly and privately that I would not be attending just due to the restrictions rules and requirements that they are asking of all their guests."

yfmk24_3956,yfmk24,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Today at 45 years old I was disowned by my father.  I won’t help him sue my neighbor.  My 5 year old son, he called collateral damage.   ISO someone willing to adopt two fiercely independent adults with the cutest 5 year old ever as substitute grandparents.  My partner doesn’t stay in contact with his parents and now I’m disowned.   We live in in Lake Co Illinois.   I’m an RN and my partner is an engineer, the build stuff kind not the train kind.   Long story but here it goes.   

I’m a strong minded, loving, well educated chemo nurse.  My parents are A trumper, a trumpford wife who constantly gives monthly donations to Joel Olsteen.  I try to reason with them without being out right disrespectful.  Last year they announced they were going to move to Missouri to be around more like minded folks and lower taxes.  My two sisters and I all lived within 20 minutes of them.   

I talked about seeing folks in my cancer hospital that moved away from their children and now are struggling in their older age without support and they laughed at me.   They were a healthy 70 year old truck driver and a frail 69 year old stay at home trump wife.   I mentioned that although they will initially save about 4 thousand in property tax they will wipe that out with one bad accident.   Needing in home care, a nursing home, home health etc… because we won’t be there to help.   They ignored me, sold their home and moved 7 hours away to MO.  

Ok here it goes.   My mom had her hip replaced prior to moving and she came up by herself with there 70lb dog to get her final appointment before choosing another orthopedic to follow up with in Mo.   She stopped by my house.   I also had a hip replaced and on this day I was exactly 2 weeks post op myself.   She asked to bring the dog in and I love their dog.  My mom and I took her dog and my kid ￼on a short walk to get some coffee.   We got back to my house and she set her phone down and stated she needed to take her dog on a longer walk and asked to take my kid.  I agreed.   They 
left, she left her phone on my counter.  I rolled my eyes because my moms whole thing is that she’s not attatched to her phone blah blah blah.   ￼

I got a call from an unknown caller about five minutes later. I’m on the ground, I can’t get up, I think I broke my leg.  I grabbed the walker I used post op threw it in my car and drive down the street to get her.   One of the ladies on my street had her dogs out.  They ran up to my moms dog and we’re doing the dog thing.   One dog barked and their dog had a really aggressive bark but is a sweet thing.   My mom got scared and fell over.  That’s what she said, that’s what my neighbor said that’s what my kid said.   She couldn’t tolerate walking with the walker so I called 911.  The ambulance took her, I dropped my kid off at daycare, and sat with my mom for five hours in the ER.  She needed surgery.   By a specialist.  She would have to make an appointment with the specialist on Monday.  She was discharged with 12 pain pills and a leg immobilizer.   Any of us would take my mom, but none of us could handle the dog.   I asked her if we could kennel her dog so I could take her home with me.  She declined.   My Dad was out on the road doing a delivery out of state and said he’d be here in five days.   Her and her dog were going to a friends house.  

In the next few days, I called and made her appointment, called her primary physician and got her more pain pills because 12 was not enough for a shattered leg over 4 days, picked up meds, brought her to the surgeon sat with her in the consult, picked her up and dropped her off at her friends house three towns away, got her surgery scheduled, took her to get her pre op labs and even made her pre-op physical appointment.   

I also picked up my dad and drove him to pick up a pick up truck, picked him up from another truck shop in Wisconsin, and got them a slip proof matt and bath towels for their extended stay suite.   My mom is doing great.   Recovering just fine.  

My dad calls and asks for the ladies number.  She called me from her cellphone.   She also texted her condolences and brought over a lasagna.  I told her my mom wasn’t staying with us and there was no need but she showed up on my doorstep, with an armload of food and praise for how brave and smart my son was.  My mom didn’t know my phone number to call me as she laid there with a broken leg, but my brave boy did.   

I told him I deleted that message, I didn’t save her number.  I don’t know their name or address.   He wants to sue them to collect his lost wages and the cost of their hotel.  I told him although I won’t assist them I won’t inhibit them either.   I offered to drive them to the exact spot She fell and maybe she could remember what house the dogs ran from.   I told them to also make a police report and out small town police will help them identify the home owners.   

They declined that help telling me I can have my phone looked at and retrieve the call log.   I told them that morally I don’t agree with them suing, because she fell.  Their dogs did not bite her or her dog or jump on my mom.  She got scared and fell.  No contact.   Again I will assist them in making a police report and/or driving to the accident site so she could recognize where she fell.

This is the text I got from my Dad yesterday.  Today he called and when I answered he said oh shit and hung up.  

“This is a very hard letter to write. You are a cheap version of Judas. You sold out your family for a pan of lasagna. You have left us in a terrible spot and you think it is funny. Their is no excuse for refusing to help us identifying the person with the dogs. I am going to miss you and all your valuable help you have given us over the years. Your son is collateral damage in this situation I’m going to miss him as well. I don’t see a way to remain cordial in this situation. I will always love you. Dad”

So yeah.   I need a little love and possibly someone to be adoptive grandparents to my little guy, collateral damage.   The silver lining in my mom’s follow up appointment was yesterday and they should be going back to MO anyday now."

I grabbed the walker I used post op threw it in my car and drive down the street to get her.   One of the ladies on my street had her dogs out.  They ran up to my moms dog and we’re doing the dog thing.   One dog barked and their dog had a really aggressive bark but is a sweet thing.   My mom got scared and fell over.  That’s what she said, that’s what my neighbor said that’s what my kid said.   She couldn’t tolerate walking with the walker so I called 911.  The ambulance took her, I dropped my kid off at daycare, and sat with my mom for five hours in the ER.  She needed surgery.   By a specialist.  She would have to make an appointment with the specialist on Monday.  She was discharged with 12 pain pills and a leg immobilizer.   Any of us would take my mom, but none of us could handle the dog.   I asked her if we could kennel her dog so I could take her home with me.  She declined.   My Dad was out on the road doing a delivery out of state and said he’d be here in five days.   Her and her dog were going to a friends house.  

In the next few days, I called and made her appointment, called her primary physician and got her more pain pills because 12 was not enough for a shattered leg over 4 days, picked up meds, brought her to the surgeon sat with her in the consult, picked her up and dropped her off at her friends house three towns away, got her surgery scheduled, took her to get her pre op labs and even made her pre-op physical appointment.   

I also picked up my dad and drove him to pick up a pick up truck, picked him up from another truck shop in Wisconsin, and got them a slip proof matt and bath towels for their extended stay suite.   My mom is doing great.   Recovering just fine.  

My dad calls and asks for the ladies number.  She called me from her cellphone.   She also texted her condolences and brought over a lasagna.  I told her my mom wasn’t staying with us and there was no need but she showed up on my doorstep, with an armload of food and praise for how brave and smart my son was.  My mom didn’t know my phone number to call me as she laid there with a broken leg, but my brave boy did.   

I told him I deleted that message, I didn’t save her number.  I don’t know their name or address.   He wants to sue them to collect his lost wages and the cost of their hotel.  I told him although I won’t assist them I won’t inhibit them either.   I offered to drive them to the exact spot She fell and maybe she could remember what house the dogs ran from.   I told them to also make a police report and out small town police will help them identify the home owners.   

They declined that help telling me I can have my phone looked at and retrieve the call log.   I told them that morally I don’t agree with them suing, because she fell.  Their dogs did not bite her or her dog or jump on my mom.  She got scared and fell.  No contact.   Again I will assist them in making a police report and/or driving to the accident site so she could recognize where she fell.

This is the text I got from my Dad yesterday.  Today he called and when I answered he said oh shit and hung up.  

“This is a very hard letter to write. You are a cheap version of Judas. You sold out your family for a pan of lasagna. You have left us in a terrible spot and you think it is funny. Their is no excuse for refusing to help us identifying the person with the dogs. I am going to miss you and all your valuable help you have given us over the years. Your son is collateral damage in this situation I’m going to miss him as well. I don’t see a way to remain cordial in this situation. I will always love you. Dad”

So yeah.   I need a little love and possibly someone to be adoptive grandparents to my little guy, collateral damage.   The silver lining in my mom’s follow up appointment was yesterday and they should be going back to MO anyday now."

I, 18 M just started collage this year out of state. I decided to stay on campus in a dorm. I have had my cat “Feta” since I was 7 so naturally I am choosing to bring her with me given that she’s only got a couple good years left. I selected the option of a “Pet Friendly” dorm (thank god my school has it) so that she would be able to stay with me. I assumed that my roommate would also be bringing a pet with them and Feta is good with pretty much everything. Anyway, when i met my roommate, also 18M and noticed he didn’t have a pet I was a bit confused. When I asked him, he joked and said “i choose pet friendly so that i could have someone else’s!”. I laughed it off and didn’t think much of it other than that was a bit strange. I figured he would perhaps be purchasing a hamster or something in the near future so i didn’t continue to question. Then, as the weeks go on, he is spending increasingly more time with Feta. And not just giving her some pats here and there, i mean feeding her, cuddling with her, and a couple times i caught him sleeping with her! As a collage student i’m pretty broke even with my part time job so i requested that since he is bonding so much withFeta that he start paying for half of her expenses. You know, just the basic stuff like litter and food. He was completely flabbergasted and said that id was ridiculous for me to even ask. Honestly after that i felt pretty bad and decided to think about it more before taking any action. Another month or so goes by and he totally does not leave Feta alone and at this point i am considering if she likes him more than me. 
I think i was starting to get jealous over his affection towards Feta so i told him he needed to stop paying her any mind because it made me uncomfortable. He agreed but i was still getting the feeling that he was petting her behind my back so i decided i would purchase a gopro to attach to her so that i would be able to watch the footage when i got back from work, just to make sure he wasn’t petting her or what not. Some may say i’m a little extreme but it’s literally my cat and not his so he has no right to control her at all. I am her person and i gave him the option to be her second person if he wanted to pay for his half of her expenses. AITAH?"
yfz63d_3969,yfz63d,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Alright Reddit of course there’s a backstory so let’s start there. 
My brother had a best friend several months ago. His best friend had a fiancé. It eventually came out that my brother and the fiancé (well call her S) was getting down and dirty. Of course best friend left and cut contact with Brother and S unless it was in regards to the kids best friend and S have in common. 
Brother and S immediately moved in together and got married. The rest of the family cut contact due to disrespect from S towards them except me. 

Now move on to today. It’s Halloween weekend! My favorite holiday and I always have the biggest group possible meet at my house for trick or treat and we all take our kids around while us adults chat, laugh, and just have a great time. Tonight is trick or treat where I live and of course tradition must go on. All are invited to our trick or treat, friends, family, neighbors, friends of friends doesn’t matter we honestly turn no one away from our group. Brother called to find out the time we’re all meeting at my house. I told him and he goes is S and the kids able to come? 
I answered Of course! It’s Halloween tradition all are welcome. 
My mom caught wind from honestly one of my kids who was excited that their cousins was joining us and had called my mom to tell them the awesome news! 
I must note the kids get along so well and play together often. This is the first year S and kids would be joining us. 
My mom demanded to speak to me to inform me the family does not speak to them and that I had ruined the holiday. And that no family is coming because of my selfish crap and I ruined the tradition. 
I reminded her it was my tradition to begin with never the families and it’s also a drama free tradition and if grown adults can’t put their own problems aside for a fun tradition for the kids than I’m revoking the all are welcome rule and only allowing those who can refrain from displaying their issues towards others in front of children. Of course that turned into me ruining Halloween for all the kids including my own. I held firm on my decision and ended the conversation. 
But I can’t help but to have this nasty nagging feeling that I’m the ah. 

Might be worth noting my mother triangulated the entire family against S and the “disrespect” was only after my mother pushed S to her breaking point. I know how my mother can be so I did not cut contact because honestly S only set boundaries which is what she needs to do with my mother or she’ll be walked all over.

Edit and an update: Essentially my mom started screaming at S and calling S names in front of her young children. And this happened on multiple occasions and S asked her to please not call her profanity in front of her children. Mom than proceeded to shove her and tell her she ain’t shit and can’t do shit in S’s own home. S asked her to leave because her children didn’t need to see someone acting like that. Because S set the same boundary I did in regards to how I’m treated in front of my children by my mother she became the bad guy. Brother and S got married in May. When we explained to my children who are older than S’s kids that they were S’s kids and that S and brother got married they then went so that makes them our cousin now? I told them kinda I guess. And the kids went with it. My children are very loving accepting kids. 
The whole family wasn’t close to the best friend just brother. The best friend actually found himself banned from my house for attempting to smack my butt and I wasn’t having it. (I don’t like being touched especially without permission!)

Mother has a habit of doing this type of stuff. She once pinned me against a wall and spit in my face and called me a stupid cunt when my children were young because I refused to give her the keys to my vehicle for an indefinite amount of time but rather offered to give her a ride to where she needed to go. This isn’t the tip of what I handled as a child. A mixture of episodes like this and the behaviors she displays is what brought the conclusion of her being a narc. I’m low contact for obvious reasons. 

Sadly my phone was going haywire when I posted this and I feel I left some details out.

Update: they ended up not joining us. Mother went to their house and walked in (didn’t even knock first) and proceeded to throw stuff across their house screaming profanities and the police were called due to her refusal to leave and the fact she was breaking the children’s belongings. They decided it wasn’t worth it over a trick or treat trip."

The biggest examples of this is she never brushed her hair or cooks food for her. I could go on a whole rant about it but that's not the main point of this post. My main point has to do with an incident that happened yesterday proceeding until this morning. I had plans to celebrate my girlfriends (22f) new job promotion with her. We were gonna go to her favourite restaurant to have the same meal we did on our first date. For me this was a big deal as I have been extremely busy recently either babysitting or trying to get the mountains of collage homework done. My aunt knew of these plans a week in advance as I had told her I wouldn't be available to watch my cousin. For context I only told her because she will often have me watch my cousin with little to no warning. As I was finishing my makeup that my cousin helped me pick out about thirty minutes before I had to leave and I saw her walk out the back door. I didn't really think anything of it as people are always coming and going from the back door. Five minutes before I needed to leave I tried to bring my cousin to her but couldn't locate her anywhere on the property. Going to grab my phone to call her I noticed a text from her saying she went out with her boyfriend and would be back in the morning. No one else was home that could watch her so I tried ringing my aunt. After getting her voicemail a few times I shot her a text saying she had 30 minutes to respond. My girlfriend definitely wasn't happy and said I should just call the cops and report it as child abandonment. When the 30 minutes had passed I took her advice, the cops showed up and took her and I left to try and salvage our date to the best of my ability. When I returned that evening my aunt was there with my cousin in tow, a lot of our family are cops and the majority of the force know my family personally so she wasn't charged but they had to report it to CPS. This morning a CPS worker showed up and asked everyone questions. When it got to my turn I held nothing back. Now that its 12 hours later I feel like a bad person and I don't know if it's just because I've had bad experiences with CPS in the past or that I'm just being an ass."

ygyy3t_4010,ygyy3t,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So let me give a little backstory. I (26F) and my mother (52F) have never really gotten along. Every achievement I have ever had, she has found a way to ruin it. Graduation? She announced she was divorcing my father in front of all of our family. She would make comments about me being darker than her. ( my father was Haitian and Dominican) She is a narcissist. Around 19 I went low contact with her. So, let me get into what happened today.

At 22 I was diagnosed with PCOS. Which I apparently had in my early teen years and she just told me I was getting fat and to work out more. She put locks on cabinets and withheld food. While now I am very active, in good overall health and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I did go from 150 lbs to 250 lbs in college because I began binge eating. Which I can take accountability for. I recently got down to 190lbs. Today my mother came by to drop my niece off with me. Haven’t seen her in 6 months. First thing she says is wow you’ve still got some weight on you. You need to take something out of your diet. It’s embarrassing you are bigger than me and you are losing your butt. You should try harder before your gym loving boyfriend finds someone shaped like me. 

I snapped. I don’t know why. Maybe because I’ve worked so hard to lose what I have. I told her I could have her body if I laid on a table and let people suck the fat out of gut and inject it into my butt. I told her she bought her body. My mom has had vsg to stay slim, a bbl, multiple rounds of lipo, cool sculpting, and implants. Well she told my stepdad, my uncle and my older sister and they are now calling me to apologize and saying i’m ITAH.  My grandma and aunt are on my side.

Should I apologize  for the sake of peace?

So kind of an Update - She left me a nasty voicemail from my sisters phone stating “Your boyfriend looks like your cousin” MY COUSIN WHO SHE KNOWS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ME. (They look nothing a like btw) Y’ALL THE LADY IS UNHINGED. I WILL BE GOING NO CONTACT. She has resorted to looking for sympathy on Facebook. Of course leaving out details. She racked up sympathy amongst her friends. It may warm some of your hearts to know she is currently being dragged by her Sally’s beauty supply clip ins in the comment section of the post by my dads side of the family and my younger half brother, that she had with my stepfather."

I have had every insult under the sun thrown at me and even have been told to unalive myself multiple times because of my red hair. the bullying got really bad around 8 years of age, i was in class and was faking my book back to the book corner when I was tripped up and was told “you should have never been born you ginger c\*nt” by a boy in my class. This went on for ages, I would be shoved into the trash bin and be told ”thats where you belong you ginger peace of sh\*t”. I told my Mother and she told my teacher everything. The next day the class were given a friendly reminder to be kind and that every one is different and beautiful no matter what. This really annoyed me but I let it go. age 11 the bullying is still happening and getting worse , there was a big group of them now and they would play games at recess called hit the ginger, the game went like this: if you hit me the most amount of times you would win. I would be hit by anything Soccer balls, sticks and punched. I told my Mother again and she phoned the school, this time I was pulled out the class and talked to, saying “you can’t take everything to heart. you need to learn to ignore it and it will stop. We will talk to them.”. The bullies got pulled out of class for 2 minutes each with no consequences. at this point my mental health was really bad, I would cry at the littlest things and was so insecure.  next day the played their usual game “hit the ginger” and I ran into the bathrooms crying and I texted my mother, she said she had had enough of it and my Dad was coming to pick me up. The vice principal ( male ) came into the female bathrooms and asked me to come out, and explained he had received a phone call saying m that I had texted my mom and scolded me for having a phone in school I ran out of the building and waited for my dad to come and get me. I didn’t go to school for months and all of my friends told me that I was lucky I get to stay off, or that I’m overreacting. I managed to go into school on the last week and what I heard outraged me. I heard my bully getting detention and shouted at for calling someone ”an Indian c\*nt“. I was so fed up and just ignored it. During Summer vacation I went to meet up with my friends and was confronted by a big gang of boys, some of them were my bullies. They all took turns telling me how ugly I was and that I should k\*ll myself because I’m ginger. My friends laughed and I ran home my Mom and Dad were fed up with it. This kept happening more and more. The bullying has stopped with those certain boys and now theres new boys bullying me. I am very insecure about the way I look no and no teacher will do anything about the bullying. I get punched in my PSE class often and my teacher delib sat me next to the bully. I feel all of this would be handled differently if it was about the colour of my skin rather than the colour of my hair. PS. I really don’t want offend anyone of colour just sharing my story and opinions. ( EDIT ) reading all of your comments  have noticed that a lot of you feel like I’m saying it’s racist towards me.

yhx5k3_4035,yhx5k3,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Hi everyone, I'll cut to the chase. I (19F) had a Halloween party over the weekend. I invited my boyfriend (21M) and a bunch of our friends over, including his girl best friend. I will call her ""Agatha"". My boyfriend and I had decided to dress up as Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater. If you haven't seen the costume, the guy wears a shirt that says Peter Peter and the girl dresses as a pumpkin because... well you know! I was pretty excited just because I thought it was a funny and cute costume. 

Agatha texted me the night before the party and asked what my costume was going to be! I explained the couple's costume my boyfriend and I would be wearing and she replied that should would probably just come as a ""sexy cat"". 

Fast forward to the night of the party, everyone is having fun and it's a nice time! Well, it was... until Agatha walked in **dressed as a pumpkin.**

She went over and hugged my boyfriend. I swear the room went silent. I was pissed. I asked if I could speak with her privately and we went into my bedroom. I asked why she chose that costume since she knew the details of the joint costume between my boyfriend and I. She said she didn't see the big deal and thought it would be a better group costume.

I told her I didn't think it was funny and I would prefer that she change. I offered her a witch costume that she could borrow for the night. She turned red and started to yell that I don't get to control what she wears. I told her that she was disrespecting my relationship by insinuating that my boyfriend and her have sex. She kept screaming about how it was funny and I needed to lighten up. I ended up asking her to leave. She stormed out of the house and I returned to the party. 

The mood had shifted and the night felt ruined. My boyfriend agrees that she crossed the line and is planning on cutting her off completely. BUT a few of our friends are saying that I was being dramatic and I should have let her stay. I guess I'm just wondering...am I the asshole?

I 25(f) am getting married in less then 6 months. My closest “friends” were asked to be bridesmaids well before I was even really engaged. One 37(f) recently had my nephew and I understand that sometimes it can be hard with an almost 1 year old in the house. The other 25(f) has recently become pregnant with a man she barely knows and got out of jail almost a month to the day that she got pregnant. Her due date is early January. I’ve been engaged since 01/01/22. 6 months goes by and no one’s doing anything. My mom is tried of watching me struggle to plan everything with the help of my one other bridesmaid. My mom being the best woman alive takes over the planing for the bridal shower and the bachelorette. Fast forward to last week almost 6 months to the day of my wedding. Neither of the 2 bridesmaid have done anything besides show up for the dress picking but they showed up late and had to rush out early. Spending almost no time with me and really only talking to each other. Last week we planned, for about 3 weeks, a day for everyone to sit down and help plan everything. But now suddenly those 2 can not attend. The pregnant one we will call A she said she couldn’t meet because she had a drs appointment at 3:30 (we weren’t meeting till 6 and she lives down the road). The other will call B said that she could not be there because her babies bed time is 7. At this point I was livid. Why agree to days and times you knew you couldn’t do. It seemed as if they didn’t care at all. In my eyes they weren’t trying. So I texted them a very long message about they were not making me a priority and how I needed them to help and support me like I had for them for years. And if they could not or did not want to help me then I would be forced to have them step down and just be guest. I was hopping when I told them I was upset they would have turned around and said I’m sorry I’ll try harder. But no they took this as the perfect time to dropout. They said they didn’t want to be bridesmaids and were better off being guest. My heart shattered. They really didn’t care and never even said they were sorry for it. 2 days later As baby shower that B and I planned with they help of bds sister is about 3 weeks away. At this point I had already shelled out 100s of dollar on the venue and food alone. I get a text from B asking if I could still help make decor, give even more money for alcohol and still help set up the day before and of. I took this as a slap in the face. They couldn’t be bothered to be there for me but expected me to still help them. I respond with a polite I can’t go at all now. B then told me that not going because I was to “busy with the wedding” was wrong. It was harsh to say I wasn’t going to go at all now but they really couldn’t see what they had done. I apologized for saying I wouldn’t go but that they need understand how they made me feel like the secondary friend, and how they hurt me by dropping out. They told me if I didn’t want them to drop out I shouldn’t have given them the option. And that they didn’t know what I wanted from them because they have busy lives because of there kids and how I will never understand what that’s like. (I can’t have kids of my own due to my pcos) at that point I was over it and told them I was done and they still haven’t responded. So I just need to know AITA for not wanting to go? Help.

EDIT: I only asked them to help me with the bridal shower the same thing I was doing for them sorry if I didn’t make that clear
EDIT 2: they agreed to a day they knew they couldn’t do, they never tried at all."

yiltjv_4049,yiltjv,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,So my boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years and we live together. We are currently going through some troubles. His childhood best friend is currently in jail for the next 3 years. His wife’s birthday is tomorrow and my boyfriend wants to celebrate it. She has 2 toddlers and a newborn and is about a 2 hour drive away. I know she’s going through trouble and it’s been tough. But I can’t help but to feel a way because for the last 2 years I’ve had to understand that we couldn’t do anything for my birthday and holidays because of financial issues. I really feel like he is going out his way for her. AITA for feeling this way.

yiqha5_4057,yiqha5,top-comment,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"My brother (26m) and I (23f) always got along with each other until just a few months ago. I recieved a wedding invitation from him and after reading through it I called him to tell him how happy I was for him and that I was going to attend the wedding. I asked him if I could bring my boyfriend (24) and my daughter (4) to wedding too (Edit: no, the wedding wasn't child-free, if it was it would've stated that on the invitation.) and he agreed to it. We talked on the phone for about another half an hour before we ended the call. On the day of the wedding, I got ready first before getting my daughter ready too. When we were ready to go, we left the house and drove off. When we arrived at the wedding we immediately went to see my brother. He gave my daughter and I a hug and introduced himself to my boyfriend. They both got along really well. When we met his soon-to-be wife, she greeted me and my boyfriend. When she saw that I had brought my daughter with me, she immediately changed her attitude and said that children weren't invited. I told her that my brother was okay with it and that she wouldn't ruin anything but refused to listen and complained to me and my brother that we should be kicked out for bring a child and that my daughter would be loud and annoying throughout the entire wedding. I reminded her that wouldn't happen but, again, she wouldn't listen. She got really annoyed and became really rude. I had enough of this and immediately took my daughter and my boyfriend home. My brother called me after the wedding to apologise for his wife's behaviour towards us. I told him that he shouldn't have to be the one to apologise and that his wife should instead, but when he tried to get her to apologise, she refused.

I am happy for my brother, but the way his wife acted was really rude and I think she owes us an apology. AITAH?"

yitgyd_4069,yitgyd,top-comment,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"I’ll try keep this short but there’s lots of details sorry! So I (18f) have been dating my boyfriend (19m) for 2 years and we never really had any issues. This was until late May 2022 when I went on holiday abroad with just my mother and he stayed at home. About a week into my holiday, when I got back to my room which was the only place I had WiFi, we spoke about our days over text and agreed to call later on. This was when he told me that he was at the park with our friends and he had played a silly game of spin the bottle, in which, he kissed his friend who we’ll name Layla on the cheek. 

Me and Layla had been friends since nursery and while we weren’t close friends in primary school, we got very close in high school, hanging out most of the time. In high school we had mutual friends who were a year above us in school, one of which was my boyfriend who we’ll call Oakley. I had never seen Oakley in more than a friend way during school and while he did like me on and off, he also liked Layla on and off (except in 2019 when he was in another relationship) but Layla had feelings on and off for him throughout high school which was totally okay. Well, as we came to the end of high school, Oakley had already left so it was just me, my friends and Layla. Layla and I had a big fallout at the end of school which got us to lose touch until we made up and became friends again a few months later. 

A few months later after finishing high school, me and Oakley had gotten together and me, Oakley and Layla started to hang out together with a few more friends. During us all hanging out, I felt as though Layla still had feelings for Oakley and I communicated this to Oakley and he didn’t see what I thought were her feelings for him. A few days later, I had seen a TikTok which was an AITA video about a woman not wanting her husband and someone to be friends because the husbands friend was clearly into him and I had commented on that video relating to it and briefly mentioned my situation and how I feel my friend (Layla) is still into my partner and a few days later, Layla saw the same video and my comment! She messaged me about it and long story short, she fell out with me. Once again, a few months later, we made contact and started hanging out again. All of that brings us back up to May time!

So as mentioned, while I was about a week into my holiday, my boyfriend told me about the little game of spin the bottle and how he kissed Layla on the cheek which upset me because he already knew my feelings regarding Layla but we moved past it. After I got home in mid June, me and my boyfriend had 2 weeks together until he was going on a college trip to the Netherlands for 2 weeks and all was fine until his holiday. I had decided to hang out with a few friends, not including Layla, to keep me company while he was away and one of those friends was also involved in the spin the bottle game, we’ll call him Jake. Jake came to me and told me he needed to tell me something involving Oakley that would most likely upset me but I told him to tell me anyway. The real story was that Oakley had kissed Layla on the cheek, but what he hasn’t told me was that he also kissed Layla on the lips.. when I found this out, I got very upset and went home which was a 20 min walk away and when I had messaged him and confronted him, he denied it until later finally admitting it but he begged me to forgive him and told me it was only a peck and that he had clarified before kissing Layla, that he loved me and that the kiss didn’t mean anything. This didn’t change anything about the way I felt and by my definition he cheated on me. We did stay together and tried our best to move on and he tried his best to regain my trust. Oakley and Layla still spoke(not very often) over text in a friendly manner and while Me and Layla still weren’t friends and while I had seen her a few times, we barely spoke. However since then, any attempts that Layla made to hang out with Oakley alone, I was concerned about and so Oakley decided not to go for my sake which annoyed Layla and Layla thought that is was all because of me and me controlling Oakley to not go with her, which wasn’t true. Since then, they hadn’t spoke for a while. That brings us to now.

Just 2 days prior to writing this, out of the blue, Layla had randomly called Oakley and asked him to come a have a conversation since she was around my area and he went, nothing happened, they spoke, then Oakley came home since we live together at my mums since a few months ago. She then messaged Oakley later that night to ask if they could go for a meal together somewhere Laylas little sister worked, just them, to which I told Oakley I didn’t want him to go because I thought the idea of them going for a meal alone was a bit weird and I still feel as though she is still interested in Oakley. So Oakley messaged her back and said that he’d rather stay local because of him not wanting a meal, and for my sake to which she agreed. She messaged him tonight saying she can go for a walk on Friday and I’m upset over this and I feel like I can’t stop Oakley from going because I don’t want to be controlling and bossy but at the same time, I’m really worried over this because I still can’t fully forgive Oakley for what he did and the way that he lied to me so I still don’t fully trust him which I know is wrong but I can’t help it. He noticed my upset but doesn’t believe he’s doing anything wrong by meeting her which I guess he’s not and while he tries his best to understand how I’m feeling, he just doesn’t get it. 

Overall, Layla hasn’t actually done anything wrong. Sure, I have my feeling that she’s still interested in Oakley but my problem is with Oakley and the way he broke my trust so I don’t really want him hanging out alone with her. 

While I feel like he’ll be upset if he find this post, I’ve seriously got not one to talk to about this anymore so I’m turning to Reddit since I’m pretty sure everyone’s sick of hearing about this whole scenario. I feel like my feelings are valid but I just don’t know anymore so, AITA for still being upset and not trusting him?"

The real story was that Oakley had kissed Layla on the cheek, but what he hasn’t told me was that he also kissed Layla on the lips.. when I found this out, I got very upset and went home which was a 20 min walk away and when I had messaged him and confronted him, he denied it until later finally admitting it but he begged me to forgive him and told me it was only a peck and that he had clarified before kissing Layla, that he loved me and that the kiss didn’t mean anything. This didn’t change anything about the way I felt and by my definition he cheated on me. We did stay together and tried our best to move on and he tried his best to regain my trust. Oakley and Layla still spoke(not very often) over text in a friendly manner and while Me and Layla still weren’t friends and while I had seen her a few times, we barely spoke. However since then, any attempts that Layla made to hang out with Oakley alone, I was concerned about and so Oakley decided not to go for my sake which annoyed Layla and Layla thought that is was all because of me and me controlling Oakley to not go with her, which wasn’t true. Since then, they hadn’t spoke for a while. That brings us to now.

Just 2 days prior to writing this, out of the blue, Layla had randomly called Oakley and asked him to come a have a conversation since she was around my area and he went, nothing happened, they spoke, then Oakley came home since we live together at my mums since a few months ago. She then messaged Oakley later that night to ask if they could go for a meal together somewhere Laylas little sister worked, just them, to which I told Oakley I didn’t want him to go because I thought the idea of them going for a meal alone was a bit weird and I still feel as though she is still interested in Oakley. So Oakley messaged her back and said that he’d rather stay local because of him not wanting a meal, and for my sake to which she agreed. She messaged him tonight saying she can go for a walk on Friday and I’m upset over this and I feel like I can’t stop Oakley from going because I don’t want to be controlling and bossy but at the same time, I’m really worried over this because I still can’t fully forgive Oakley for what he did and the way that he lied to me so I still don’t fully trust him which I know is wrong but I can’t help it. He noticed my upset but doesn’t believe he’s doing anything wrong by meeting her which I guess he’s not and while he tries his best to understand how I’m feeling, he just doesn’t get it. 

Overall, Layla hasn’t actually done anything wrong. Sure, I have my feeling that she’s still interested in Oakley but my problem is with Oakley and the way he broke my trust so I don’t really want him hanging out alone with her. 

While I feel like he’ll be upset if he find this post, I’ve seriously got not one to talk to about this anymore so I’m turning to Reddit since I’m pretty sure everyone’s sick of hearing about this whole scenario. I feel like my feelings are valid but I just don’t know anymore so, AITA for still being upset and not trusting him?"

yj1h3v_4084,yj1h3v,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1," So for some background, I (15, male) was forced to go trick-or-treating with my family and take care of my 1 year old sister. She and my dad drove me and my siblings to our grandmothers house, so we can go trick-or-treating with our cousins who were staying there for a little while. Once she dropped us off she took some pictures and left, but not before telling me to take care of my little sister. After a little while my cousins, siblings, and I were finally gonna leave to go trick-or-treating, but while we were leaving I notice the bag my little sister was gonna use to go trick-or-treating with was ripped. Though I just shrugged it off and made the choice of just sharing my bag with her. So the day goes on as normal, with my aunt dropping us off to go to houses for candy. That was until we came across this guy who was giving out money as well as candy too. He was giving out 20 dollar bills to everyone that came across him, even my cousins who were 2 and 5. When I had got their I was holding my 1 yr old sister while also holding the bag out so the man can put the candy inside. After he did that he gave me a 20 dollar bill right in my hand and moved on to next person. My family and I were pretty excited and hyped about it for rest of the time till we went back to our grandmothers house again. Everyone was chilling around till, my mom and dad came back to pick my siblings and I up. When we went out to the car my other sister (12,female) told my mom about the guy who was handing out money. Telling them he even gave money to our little cousins. She then asks were was my 1 yr old sisters 20 dollar bill was. I proceeded to tell her that she didn't get 20 dollars hence she's a baby. She then argues that if my 2 yr old cousin had got a 20 then so would have my little sister. I then explain to her how me and my sister shared a bag and the guy only gave us one 20 dollar bill for the one bag. She then demands that I give my sister half the 20 (10 dollars)since we were sharing the bag. I argue that I shouldn't split 20 dollars with a baby who cant even speak. Though she kept demanding that I split it or she takes the whole 20. I tell that she's not gonna do that and storm off. Its been 1 day since then and we still haven't determine whos in the wrong. So I'm asking reddit. Am I the asshole?"

Recently, he told me he wanted to bring his sister (f17) here (we are both from different countries). Bare in mind I don't know her or anyone of his family as they are back home. He then proceeded to tell me that he wanted to look for a house for me and his sister so we can live together and i can take care of her so he's sure his sister is safe. I told him I wasn't interested as I left my home country to be independent and I feel like having such a responsibility will make me dependent again. He said he can't take her in his house as he lives with his two sons and has no space left for her. Also, she doesn't speak English or any other language I speak (I speak 5). He's now angry because I said I wasn't willing to do it. So, AITA?

Edit: thanks all for your comments. After reading them I spoke to him, and he kept saying how wonderful it would be and I told him I wasn't at all interested. He kept insisting so I completely ended things with him. Thanks again"

I have two teenage boys I took in and later adopted long before ever meeting my husband, 10yrs before ever meeting him to be precise. 

My oldest obtained a phone and has a history of sharing his location through apps. 

I downloaded snapchat after not having it in 6 years to be able to see if my oldest son was sharing his location with the public. 
I used my same login info I had previously used. 
I downloaded it, found my son, ensured location services weren’t active to the public, and closed the app. Didn’t think anything else of it and went about my life and forgot about it. 

My husband and I get into an argument over finances today because I’m going back to work in a week and he doesn’t want to have to put gas in my car for me to transport the baby to the sitter 3 days a week until I get my first paycheck back. So I tell him not to worry about it and I’d figure it out. Exactly like that. 

I’d been on medical leave for 5 months now and have been working from home. Not making a lot, but enough to cover gas and little household things. So when I told him not to worry about it and that I’d figure it out, I figured he’d think I’d do some online work over the next week. But, he didn’t. 

He immediately went to “you going to get money from your boyfriend on Snapchat?” 
Uhm… excuse me? Where did that come from? 
Then he tells me the exact date I downloaded the app and says he saw the snap code when my phone was open, then tells me that “6 chicks and one bearded emoji dude” are in my inbox and that the bearded emoji dude was not my son but was supposedly my Snapchat boyfriend. 

Keep in mind, I haven’t used this app in 6yrs and never fully understood how to use it to begin with. It was one of those download and delete apps for me. 

I start defending myself bc he’s accused me of cheating on him at this point, asking him what guy and even took a screenshot of my inbox where it said almost 400wks ago on every chat listed, but apparently since it was downloaded a week ago, I’m lying and have a bearded Snapchat emoji boyfriend. 

So he went to bed as soon as he got home tonight, stretched out completely horizontally in the bed and didn’t move an inch when I attempted to get him to move so I could get to bed.

He apologized for assuming, but not for accusing. His exact words were “well… sorry for assuming then” 

He was correct on the “6 chicks and 1 bearded emoji dude” being in my inbox. However, the bearded emoji dude is my cousin who lives 4 states away.

AITA for not telling him about the reason I downloaded Snapchat right away, and sleeping on the couch because I’m mad he accused me?"

My girlfriend insisted on leaving her job after somebody got the promotion she wanted. Meaning I am now working twice as hard just to keep our house afloat. To give you guys a little intake on how much I have to work in order to provide a decent living. *I make 29$ an hour but we live in Las Angeles and my girlfriend loves to shop* if you know you know how expensive it is to even step foot in LA let alone live there.

My girlfriend has been craving a lot more of my attention lately since I typically work 2-3 shifts a day, come home, eat, shower &amp; gts. So instead of using my one off day to destress and get ready for the next work week I went and bought a lot of snacks &amp; me and my girl cuddled and watched every saw movie. 

After my off day my girlfriend made a huge amount of money out of our account  without telling me so we were short 3k for rent. I had to talk with the landlord and explain everything and they gave us 2 weeks to get the money.  I asked my gf if there was anything she can do to bring in money rather it’s instacart, Amazon flex SOMETHING. She refused which left me in a really bad place. I was stuck working 4 shifts a day everyday with no off day for 2 weeks just to get the money back she spent. She then started to complain about how I never have time for her and that she wants me to take a week off &amp; give her all my time. I told her I can’t do that because we are in deep trouble with money and I need to be able to provide for the house. I told her it is hard living in this lavish city only making 29$ an hour &amp; my spouse not helping at all so taking a week off just to cater to you isn’t really the top thing on my list rn.  She told me I was putting my job before her &amp; that I should be ashamed. I told her I wouldn’t have to put my job be for her if she would help bring in some money just a little bit. *no we do not have kids all we have is a dog* so AITA?"

But then came my step sister ( 11f) and stepbrother (9m) showed up. My stepfather made my birthday all about my stepsiblings saying  ""  oh let z open a present because she's younger"" or "" can b go first for games  he really wants to?"" My last straw was that when my cake was brought out, two names had been added on so it said, ""happy birthday Brando (my name) Zoe and Bulin (step siblings FAKE NAME*""  I was so mad she did that to me when I asked her why she said ""they felt left out"" I busted in to tears and told my mom I didn't even want a birthday anymore  and ran out. "" My called my phone over and over saying it wasn't a big deal and to get over it. My grandmother I can live with them for 3 months cause they are renovating and need the help.

ymj850_4176,ymj850,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Okay, so... I might have gone too far with this one. Here's the story; I had my sons, 1 and 3 years old at the park. I had my 1 year old in a swing while my toddler played close by. My toddler has a toy firetruck he calls ""wee-woo"", and we always bring it to the park.
Usually, everyone is cool with this because he prefers to play by himself or with me. (Covid really messed up his social skills, he doesn't really know how to react with other toddlers yet). So, anyway, 3 year old is playing with wee-woo, happy as can be. Suddenly this fucking Karen storms over from the nearby picnic tables and TAKES MY SONS TOY! Instantly, there was tears and crying, and before I could even say one fucking thing, she tells him not to be a baby and walks away.
I am beyond livid by this point. I gather my children and put them in the car. Then I walked over to this lady and grabbed her purse. She FREAKED out, but I just walked away. I told her when she gives my sons toy back, she can have her purse. She threatened to call the cops, I told her go ahead. She can't just take someone else's property, even a toddlers. She told me her phone was in her ourse, I shrugged and said too bad. After freaking out for a couple minutes she handed over my sons truck. I told her if she wanted her purse back, to go apologize to my kid. She refused, called me all manner of names. So... I threw her purse in the garbage bin on my way out of the park.
I want it to be noted that at least three couples saw this whole interaction, and not one person said anything. Idk if they just didn't want to get involved, but nobody called me an asshole or told me to back off, but they also didn't say anything about her taking my sons toy. So... was I the asshole? Did I go too far? 

EDIT TO ADD: Yes, the truck does make noise. It's definitely not THAT loud, and tons of kids in the community bring toys that make noise to the parks. Everyone is usually whatever about this, unless it's like fireworks loud. If the noise was the problem, the truck does have an on/off switch that I would have turned off IF SHE HAD ASKED."

Obviously she was in all her right to reject but it caught me off guard and didn’t really know what to answer, so i simply said “oh ok, thank you” 
Apparently this really pissed her off and started telling me i was a petty b and that i was making her feel uncomfortable 
The man sitting behind me hear everything and told her she was really rude and disrespecfull towards me, and i told him “don’t even worry about it, im not going to argue with somebody that shows no education or empathy, hope i get home safe”
Oh. My. Lord. Why did i said that 
This woman started to have a fully breakdown screaming at me that i was hitting her, shouting every insult you could imagine and after the driver told her she needed to get out the bus, she scream to me “i hope somebody follows you to your house, watch out”, i went blank. Didnt know what to say. I dont think i said anything disrespectfull but they were a few people in the bus that told me i was wrong and really a petty b. So AITA?"

My dad and i took turns driving home because I’m still not very comfortable behind the wheel. 

I bought the car so I could get it insured and registered, since my dad’s vehicle is not, and I could use it for my driving test. In my state, it’s legal to register a car without a license, so long as you have valid state ID and insurance and you aren’t the primary driver. When I bought the car, i asked my dad if he would sign the title with me for this reason, he said yes but he never did.

Since then we’ve made plans to go to the dmv, but he canceled on me twice.

The third time I went to do it myself, and they informed me that I was lucky they didn’t have me put in the police car out front as I have a bench warrant out for my arrest.

Logically it would make sense to leave there and turn myself in, but there’s a few problems.

1) I don’t remember being issued a court date
2) I’m in the middle of a semester in college 
3)I just started a new job

I actually don’t know what to do. So I explained the situation to my dad, basically asking him to register the car in his name (i would pay for everything) so i could be able to use it for school and work related stuff until the end of the term (next month, mid December) when i finish the term and i can turn myself in. It’ll also give me time to let my boss know ill be out a few days and establish a bit of rapport.

He got upset that I went alone after he didn’t show and sent me a link to a bail bondsmen. He didn’t really give an answer. Later on i called him and asked him what he thought about it and he basically snapped saying that i was an adult now and I should have been more responsible, that now I’m making it everyone else’s problem. And i admitted he was right, but i needed his help. My friends my age still live with their parents, if they have cars their parents bought them and registered them, and then helped them get their licenses too. Pay for repairs and bills while their kids drive us around. I literally just wanted a tag for my car! I would pay for everything, just like i have been. Ive been living on my own for two years, I’m very responsible when it comes to my bills and just this one time, I couldn’t do it all myself. He said i was entitled and felt like the world owed me something for good behavior or something like that. I told him I just wanted my DAD to be there for me when I needed a favor (besides like $10 for food every blue moon that I always pay back). He said he wished he had a dad like him growing up, which is something he just throws out anytime you think about disagreeing with him. 

That’s when I told him he wasn’t as good as he thinks. He just said “fine, be that way” And hung up. He’s been ignoring me for days but my sister thinks I’m an AH. My brother is on my side and agrees my dad could at least try."

ynept5_4204,ynept5,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Edit: Since I'm getting tired of replying to the same comments over and over. I'll be rewriting the story - the original will still be there, scroll down. 

I 15F decided around December 2021, I'll be living a healthier lifestyle and start going to the gym. To which a few months later, I was fitter than I was before. I have a cousin, 17F, who is obese. She was already born with fat on her, but over the years it gradually built up. She knew I go to the gym but didn't comment on anything until a few months later. Whenever I was around her, usually at family events. She'd say something like, ""try a burger,"" or shit like that. Shaming for having a skinny body, and my lifestyle decisions. 

The whole event happened at my aunt's birthday party, which happened to be her mom. I was sitting down in the living room, eating carrots. When my cousins (Her and her little sister, 15F) and their friends came up to me. My cousin made a comment along the lines of, ""Carrots? Any more you'll be looking like that girl from Squidgame."" (They're talking about Hoyeon Jung, who is a skinny person, to what I've seen online, also gets body shamed.) They started giggling, some smiling. It honestly annoyed me and was seriously my breaking point. Any chances they have, they'll make a stupid remark. So I replied with something along the lines of, "" At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest, will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually I’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking you guys are causing."" I was happy so I smiled, almost laughed because suddenly the motherfuckers were quiet. However, her mother heard me, who happens to be also obese. She walked over to us, to yell at me for insulting her daughters and friends in front of her, and in her own house. As if they weren't just insulting me, and she didn't do shit. Which pissed me off even more, so I make a remark. ""Chill, quit stomping, you'll break the floors you pig."" Some of the guests were looking at us, and some are doing their own things. At this point, she and her daughters started yelling at me but honestly, I didn't listen. I'm guessing one of the other guests told my parents and they quickly went inside. My aunt started berating my mother for raising such a disrespectful daughter, the irony. I couldn't stop myself, so I created another comment, something like, ""OMG, it's getting so crowded the fuck, quit taking all the space will yah?"" We got kicked out after. My parents were mad at first, not because I insulted my cousins, but because I caused a scene in front of people. Besides, my dad doesn't like them either, we're only keeping in contact because she's my mom's cousin. Also, my mom does not like conflict, and that's why most of the time I ignored it. Nor do I like confronting people. You see, in their eyes, there is no such thing as body shaming skinny people because they are society's standard. Therefore it's okay, in their minds to shame them. Also, my aunt does not like to discipline them in any way, she enables their actions to the point at their grown-ass age, they whine and make a scene like kids when they don't get things their way. 

Anyways, this might be the final update. I have a life to get to. LOL. I don't regret my actions, I'm going to treat you the same you treat me. And to the people wondering, I only posted this to get people's opinions if body shaming can go both ways. Also, it's honestly sad, at their grown age, they're shaming a 15-year-old. LOL.


OG: 
I know it sounds pretty bad, but please listen. People I know will probably see this but whatever, this is my side of the story. 

I 15F am a skinny person, not that skinny to the point where you can see my bone through my skin. I still have fat, just skinny because I go to the gym. I have a cousin 17F who is obese because she likes to eat. 

I’ll head straight to the point. This hoe likes to make comments on my body. Ex, “Try a burger.”, “You guys hear a skeleton?” (minecraft reference). “You’re withering like Bella.” (twilight reference)., etc… The event happened at my aunts birthday party, her mom. I was sitting down, eating some carrots. When the bitch came up to me, with some of her friends and sister. 

She said something like, “Gee carrots? Anymore, you’ll be looking like that girl from Squid game. There’s meat on the menu.” (not the exact wording, just what I can remember) And for anyone who do not know of the reference, the girl from Squid game, Hoyeon Jung, is a skinny person - look her up. The people that were with her started giggling, they are also big. So I replied with, “At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually i’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking thats happening.” (not exact wording) I smiled, almost giggled at their faces that looked dumbfounded and angry. They were very quiet, and also her mom, heard me say it. Also obese. She got mad me, saying things like how dare I insult her daughters in her own house. I made remark, “YO CHILL! Quit stomping on the floors, you’ll break them you pig.” Not my best moments, I was just pissed off. Everybody was also looking at us. My parents were in the backyard but came to us quickly after someone told them what happened. Everyone came inside also. VERY CROWDED. People were asking us what was going on, while the obese people were yelling at me. I made another remark, “OMG PLEASE ITS SO CROWDED IN HERE, QUIT TAKING ALL THE SPACE WILL YAH?” My family and I got kicked out LOL. At first my parents were mad, until I told them the story, found out my dad didn’t like them ether. Mom told me to be nicer because my aunt is her cousin. LOL. FOUND OUT THAT THE OBESE PEOPLE LEFT OUT THE FACT THEY WERE ALSO BODYSHAMING ME AND ONLY INCLUDED MY REMARKS. SOME WHO KNOW OF THE STORY ARE SAYING YOU CANT BODYSHAME A PERSON THAT IS SOCIETY’S STANDARD. Like WHAT?!? 

Anyways, I honestly don’t care what they think. If you going to body shame me, I’ll do the same. LOL.

Edit: Since i’ve been getting the same comments a lot. I’ll clarify some things.

ynept5_4206,ynept5,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"Edit: Since I'm getting tired of replying to the same comments over and over. I'll be rewriting the story - the original will still be there, scroll down. 

I 15F decided around December 2021, I'll be living a healthier lifestyle and start going to the gym. To which a few months later, I was fitter than I was before. I have a cousin, 17F, who is obese. She was already born with fat on her, but over the years it gradually built up. She knew I go to the gym but didn't comment on anything until a few months later. Whenever I was around her, usually at family events. She'd say something like, ""try a burger,"" or shit like that. Shaming for having a skinny body, and my lifestyle decisions. 

The whole event happened at my aunt's birthday party, which happened to be her mom. I was sitting down in the living room, eating carrots. When my cousins (Her and her little sister, 15F) and their friends came up to me. My cousin made a comment along the lines of, ""Carrots? Any more you'll be looking like that girl from Squidgame."" (They're talking about Hoyeon Jung, who is a skinny person, to what I've seen online, also gets body shamed.) They started giggling, some smiling. It honestly annoyed me and was seriously my breaking point. Any chances they have, they'll make a stupid remark. So I replied with something along the lines of, "" At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest, will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually I’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking you guys are causing."" I was happy so I smiled, almost laughed because suddenly the motherfuckers were quiet. However, her mother heard me, who happens to be also obese. She walked over to us, to yell at me for insulting her daughters and friends in front of her, and in her own house. As if they weren't just insulting me, and she didn't do shit. Which pissed me off even more, so I make a remark. ""Chill, quit stomping, you'll break the floors you pig."" Some of the guests were looking at us, and some are doing their own things. At this point, she and her daughters started yelling at me but honestly, I didn't listen. I'm guessing one of the other guests told my parents and they quickly went inside. My aunt started berating my mother for raising such a disrespectful daughter, the irony. I couldn't stop myself, so I created another comment, something like, ""OMG, it's getting so crowded the fuck, quit taking all the space will yah?"" We got kicked out after. My parents were mad at first, not because I insulted my cousins, but because I caused a scene in front of people. Besides, my dad doesn't like them either, we're only keeping in contact because she's my mom's cousin. Also, my mom does not like conflict, and that's why most of the time I ignored it. Nor do I like confronting people. You see, in their eyes, there is no such thing as body shaming skinny people because they are society's standard. Therefore it's okay, in their minds to shame them. Also, my aunt does not like to discipline them in any way, she enables their actions to the point at their grown-ass age, they whine and make a scene like kids when they don't get things their way. 

Anyways, this might be the final update. I have a life to get to. LOL. I don't regret my actions, I'm going to treat you the same you treat me. And to the people wondering, I only posted this to get people's opinions if body shaming can go both ways. Also, it's honestly sad, at their grown age, they're shaming a 15-year-old. LOL.


OG: 
I know it sounds pretty bad, but please listen. People I know will probably see this but whatever, this is my side of the story. 

I 15F am a skinny person, not that skinny to the point where you can see my bone through my skin. I still have fat, just skinny because I go to the gym. I have a cousin 17F who is obese because she likes to eat. 

I’ll head straight to the point. This hoe likes to make comments on my body. Ex, “Try a burger.”, “You guys hear a skeleton?” (minecraft reference). “You’re withering like Bella.” (twilight reference)., etc… The event happened at my aunts birthday party, her mom. I was sitting down, eating some carrots. When the bitch came up to me, with some of her friends and sister. 

She said something like, “Gee carrots? Anymore, you’ll be looking like that girl from Squid game. There’s meat on the menu.” (not the exact wording, just what I can remember) And for anyone who do not know of the reference, the girl from Squid game, Hoyeon Jung, is a skinny person - look her up. The people that were with her started giggling, they are also big. So I replied with, “At least I don’t eat the whole goddamn menu, geez, leave some for the guest will you. Woah, you guys hear that? The floor is shaking, probably from the hippopotamuses that are standing in front of me. Careful you’ll break the floors, actually i’m surprised you haven’t yet considering all the shaking thats happening.” (not exact wording) I smiled, almost giggled at their faces that looked dumbfounded and angry. They were very quiet, and also her mom, heard me say it. Also obese. She got mad me, saying things like how dare I insult her daughters in her own house. I made remark, “YO CHILL! Quit stomping on the floors, you’ll break them you pig.” Not my best moments, I was just pissed off. Everybody was also looking at us. My parents were in the backyard but came to us quickly after someone told them what happened. Everyone came inside also. VERY CROWDED. People were asking us what was going on, while the obese people were yelling at me. I made another remark, “OMG PLEASE ITS SO CROWDED IN HERE, QUIT TAKING ALL THE SPACE WILL YAH?” My family and I got kicked out LOL. At first my parents were mad, until I told them the story, found out my dad didn’t like them ether. Mom told me to be nicer because my aunt is her cousin. LOL. FOUND OUT THAT THE OBESE PEOPLE LEFT OUT THE FACT THEY WERE ALSO BODYSHAMING ME AND ONLY INCLUDED MY REMARKS. SOME WHO KNOW OF THE STORY ARE SAYING YOU CANT BODYSHAME A PERSON THAT IS SOCIETY’S STANDARD. Like WHAT?!? 

Anyways, I honestly don’t care what they think. If you going to body shame me, I’ll do the same. LOL.

Edit: Since i’ve been getting the same comments a lot. I’ll clarify some things.

1. This has been happening for months, a while after I started going to the gym. So maybe around April? I started working out December 2021. 

2. Family watched while they shamed and bullied me, but has done nothing.

3. Their mom, my aunt, does absolutely nothing to discipline them. She knows what they do to me, but take no action.

ynesb6_4212,ynesb6,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"   So my (23f) fiance (26m) do this thing sometimes where we play fight. Tonight, we weren't really play flighting, but he was grabbing my boobs and ass despite me trying to get him to stop. At one point it became ""playful"" (for him, I wanted him to stop groping me, and for me, it was never playful) and he stuck his finger in my nose. At the time, he had me pretty much pinned down and there wasn't much I could do besides move my head, so I tried to tell him to stop but when he didn't, I bit him on the chest. I thought the bite would let him know I wanted him to get his finger out of my nose, since it wasn't a hard bite, but he just dug it deeper. Keep in mind that I have verbally expressed discomfort and I cannot move any part of my body other than my head without hurting him. He shoves his finger way into my nose to the point it feels like he's breaking it (I've had my nose broken before, I know what it feels like) so I bite him harder (I can admit that I bit him pretty hard) and reeled my head back and started moving other parts of my body (even though I know it was hurting him for me to do so) in order to get away from him. Aside from the fact that sticking your finger up someone else's nose is...weird to say the least, it was also causing me pain. So I did what I needed to do in order to get away from it, regardless of how it might hurt him.

   When I finally got away from him, I turned over and refused to let him touch me (we were in bed) but I continuously had to blow/wipe my nose as it was hurt and bleeding. When i refused to touch him, he got up and went to the living room to sit on the couch. On my way to the bathroom to blow the blood out of my nose, I gave him a dirty look. He got all mad about it and asked what my problem was. I told him my nose was bleeding and that he had taken it too far. He got even more upset, pulled his shirt up to show the mark on his chest where I had bit him and said ""well you were biting me!"". I feel bad for biting him as hard as I did, but damn, he was actively hurting *me* and I didnt know what to do. I was just doing whatever I could think of to make it stop. I feel bad about it, but I told him I wouldn't have bit him if he hadn't shoved his finger up my nose when I was trying to get him to stop messing with me to begin with. Now I feel like a piece of shit, and that I should have just tried to wiggle away instead of biting him. At the same time, I can't be mad at myself for internally panicking a little when he didnt respond to my verbal cues trying to get him to stop. I just don't see what I did wrong when I tried every other way to get him to stop hurting me, and only resorted to my own violence when he wouldn't listen. For context, we do this kind of thing a lot. We'll be ""play fighting"" (or not) and it'll basically be a game of ""say mercy"" (with my consent or not) where whoever backs off first loses. He always wins because he has a higher pain tolerance than I do, and honestly I think he gets off on it. Like it's some weird way of him ""proving"" his dominance? Not sure if that makes sense, but knowing him, thats definitely what I think it is. Although I dont know why he would feel the need to ""prove"" his dominance towards me? I'm half his size and less than half his strength. Why should he need to ""prove"" that kind of thing to me? Honestly, at this point, it feels like he just likes the feeling of getting away with hurting me, with me not being able to do anything about it except submit until he stops hurting me. Wording it like that makes it sound like I'm in an abusive relationship, and I may be, but the way he paints the picture of how everything works, the way he is mad at me right now, makes me feel like I'm crazy. To get mad at me for biting him when I was trying to defend myself from him bloodying my nose? Idk. Somewhere deep down, I know that's a fucked up thing for him to do. But another part of me keeps thinking that I just should have submitted to begin with, and he would have never felt the need to do what he did. I think the part of me that knows how fucked up this is just needs validation because... What the *fuck* kind of boyfriend sticks his finger up his girlfriends nose until her nose it on the verge of breaking just because she was trying to wiggle away from his sexual advancements? And no, we don't have sex very often, which may be the reason he is the way he is, but at the same time, I think I would be more sexual if he wasnt so aggressive. 

I dont know. I feel like the bad, horrible ""sex withholding girlfriend"". But at the same time I feel like I have a reason for withholding it because him being so weirdly aggressive all the time does not turn me on. It's not like I don't want to have sex with him. He's attractive and we used to have a lot of sex, but hes started acting out like this so much lately that I just don't want to anymore. It's like I'm constantly fighting off all of these mildy aggressive things he does like poking me super hard in the ribs, grabbing my boobs way too hard and slapping my ass too hard and holding my wrists and grabbing my arms to the point I perpetually have hand print bruises on my arms. If I say anything, he just instantly jumps to ""well I just won't touch you at all then"" although he has occasionally looked remorseful when seeing the bruises after the fact, but he never apologizes he just throws himself a pity party because I bruise so easily. I don't understand why he thinks I would want to screw him all the time when he's doing those kinds of things, the way we used to screw all the time before he started doing it. I wish he would just leave me alone and stop groping me when I make it clear I don't want him to. And stop becoming (what I perceive as violent) when I don't allow him to grope me. I feel like I'm being punished for having boundaries, and I also feel like I got punished for biting when I shouldnt have. The way he treats me over things like this (which happen all the time) makes me feel like I'm just a bitch. But at the same time, I feel like I'm not acting like a bitch. I feel genuinely hurt and confused. I don't know what to think anymore because it seems like everything I think is wrong."
yngkwo_4217,yngkwo,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Me (17F) and my bf (17M) have been in a relationship for a year now. Before the relationship he did unspeakable things to me and he wasn't trustworthy. Puberty and high-school changed him and he started treating me really well. I still have lots of insecurities when it comes to him and I've been open about this matter with him. Last night he told me he was invited to a party that was hosted by one of his friends friend. He always states that he hates parties since he never does anything and he considers them boring af. He said he would ask me if he decided to go (even though he probably wouldn't go as he said). Btw I forgot to mention that in the first month of our relationship he got drank and he would have cheated on me if the other girl didn't stop him. Anyway the following day I was having a mental break down bc the last few months have been really depressing for me (lost 2 of my grandparents, my parents seperated after 18 years of marriage and I had other issues with friends etc). I was upset and all I wanted was to talk to him since he is the only person that is THIS close to me and loves me. I was waiting for him to return home in order for us to talk (he was out with a friend to buy shoes). He suddenly texted me that he was right outside of the party. I lost it and I told him not to talk to me anymore. He knew my insecurity and yet he never told me he would go - not until he was already there. He said that he did not have any Internet to tell me or whatsoever. My heart ached but I managed to talk calmly and to tell him to stop talking to me and that I'd go to sleep. I wished him goodnight while I sobbed. So am I being stupid and paranoid over something small ?

Update : he sent me a long paragraph as a goodnight text and apologized. He told me he loves me etc I didn't answer bc I was heading to my grandfather's memorial so I wasn't in the mood. I still feel horrible :/"

ynll09_4225,ynll09,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"This is my first marriage, and hopefully my only marriage. I am learning the ins and outs of what is acceptable and what is not.
So, my cousin recently got married, and she told me she put a honeymoon tip jar on a table at her wedding. The idea to me sounded a little odd, but she said a lot of people do it. She never asked for cash gifts, and this way people could donate if they wanted to, no pressure.
But... wouldn't they feel like a-holes if they didn't tip and other people did? Isn't that a kind of pressure? My cousin said I should totally do it, but I'm not sure.
Do people actually do this? Is it a thing? I only recently learned that wearing red to a wedding means you've slept with the groom so... I'm really a loss with wedding etiquette lol. So, WIBTA?"
ynw8kr_4230,ynw8kr,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"I (51F) had this friend for about 10 years (Abby F 35). We were really close, she had another best friend and they were closer than we were, but we were all really close at one time. We all went to school together and Abby and I ended up working together for several years.

I felt like that we were growing apart, even after I bought a house closer to the two of them. I made sure to have a space that people could hang out and no one really came over. Abby has been single almost the whole time we have been friends. I have always been casually involved with one or two guys.

I had broken up with the main guy I was seeing and pursued this guy at work (Rick early 40's). I cooked him food and brought it to work after I found out his favorite foods, added him on instagram, and we had some private conversations online but it never really took off. Abby knew about it, she said he was nice but she just didn't find him attractive.

I ended up rekindling with my main guy after my daughter left for college. I let him move into my house and his children come over frequently. I am getting older and I think it makes sense for us to just be together at this point.

Where the problem is- Abby called me one day and told me that Rick from work had asked for her number and she ""just wanted me to know"". I hung up on her, I know that she was probably talking to him the whole time and that's why he wasn't interested in me. I feel like this made me look very foolish and I was just a joke to everyone.

We haven't talked in almost a year and we don't work together anymore but have many common acquaintances. Someone asked me about Abby since it was her birthday recently. I told them the story and said we don't talk anymore. They didn't outright say I was the AH - but basically said I was being ""immature"" about it.

So- AITAH for not talking to my friend anymore?

Edit/Addition: I went to a community college with Abby. I went to school later in life after my divorce and met my two friends there. 

I don't feel like I ""own"" anyone or anyone owes me anything.

I feel like the entire point of this was missed, I am not hung up on this situation - it was brought up by a mutual person who knows us both because most people knew us as ""best friends"" so it was shocking to this person we weren't friends anymore. I do not seek out Abby or wonder what she is doing day to day.

His closet is really messy, everything's towering and falls easily so I fixed it, organized it by use and kind of top. I didn't do the other side with his pants as I was tired. He was gone the entire weekend with his friends (every weekend), and I was left to play and babysit his cousins. I let them help me fold and gave them a shower and everything. I didn't realize i folded one of the jackets i gave him and placed it in the area where his pants were, but i knew it was because the top shelf was too full and still messy.

He had this low, stern voice, like a parent scolding a child.

""Who put this jacket here? Here, with my pants? Why did you put it there? Is that correct? Do you think it's right?""

And this pissed me off. I hate it when he scolds me like a child. I told him ""it's just a jacket. I didn't know. And the top shelf was messy! There was no space!""

Then he raised his voice, telling me ""so you couldn't fix the top shelf?!"" 

I told him it's not my closet, and that I always do OUR laundry, with 90% of it being his clothes. I hang them up to dry and fold them. While he finds an excuse that he's hungover or he's got something to do with friends. He didn't thank me for doing that, but he noticed the one jacket and went off at me. 

He told me he's not asking me to fold everything in the messy shelf, but to at least fix it so the jacket could fit.

I kept reminding him I was sorry, it's just a jacket and he doesn't need to berate me over it. He's not OCD or anything, he just has serious anger issues. He kept telling me he's tired of repeating it. And i told him it's hardly that I end up doing it, it's either his drunk ass or his little cousins who try to help.

Even when it comes to his room, he'll berate me for not sweeping, when I tell him it's his room. And that why does he have to wait for me to do it, why cant he just do it then let me know that next time, it'd be nice if I could sweep his room. (Tbh, I always end up cleaning it!)


He then told me I always want to be right. I told him we're both wrong here. I shouldn't have put the jacket there, he shouldn't berate me. Told me ""so every time you're wrong I need to be wrong too?""

I keep telling him he can be mad. I deserve it! But he can't call me names, yell at me or scream, slam or throw stuff. Told him it's not him being mad, it's HOW he reacts when mad.

I was tired of it so I packed up my stuff (usually Monday morning he leaves for work and he makes me stay back to accompany his grandma on the commute, since I commute back home and she goes to work). I was ready to head out and he said ""You're really stupid. You know I'm not ready yet and you're gonna leave already? What will my relatives think?""

I tried giving him a kiss goodbye prior, but he turned away. So i was fuckin' confused and tried to leave before he said those things to me.

I am not here for any medical advice regarding vasectomies or birth control. I am just here for peoples opinions about if I’m the asshole!

I am 19 m and have a girlfriend (18f). We have been dating since I was 17 and she’s been using birth control since around then.

I would like to be very clear that I have not once pressured her or asked her to use birth control. I regularly check in and ask if she ever wants to quit using them and switch over to condoms for sex but she keeps saying no as it “feels better”. 

Recently, she’s been asking me to get a vasectomy so she can come off birth control and still have unprotected sex. I tell her time and time again, no. But each time she comes back with the response of “We’re not planning to have kids anytime soon and vasectomies are reversible!” But each time I have still said no. Each time I offer her to use condoms instead she then insists that a vasectomy is a better idea.

From what I know not all vasectomy reversals work and because I’m 19 I don’t want to risk losing the chance to have a kid, either with my current girlfriend or any future partner.

The most recent argument about this caused her to tell me that she uses birth control so that I could have unprotected sex with her. I told her that I did not once ask for this and she got upset with me and called me an asshole for not getting a vasectomy while she continues to use birth control. 

Because of this most recent argument she keeps crying to her friends about how I apparently don’t love her enough to get a vasectomy and they keep pestering me about it and about how much she’s crying. I calmly explain the situation to them and they just continue to argue with me too. 

I understand that many birth control methods can cause health risks, it’s one of the reasons I kept offering condoms for us and it would also help prevent sti’s and pregnancies too.

Aita for making my girlfriend cry all because I refuse to get a vasectomy for her?"

We are super excited but wedding planning is hard. So the story is that my fiancé and I don't have a lot of money so we are asking people to bring a dish to share, completely optional. For about 150 people with me making some of the food as well. My mother in law says she's embarrassed as the mother of the groom to ask people to bring a dish to share as some of the family lives like 40ish minutes away. My cousin had drove 8 hours with 4 kids and a three tier cake and it was fine. But anyway she is practically telling me that I need to get it catered but we don't have the money for that as I grew up very poor and no one in my family has that kind of money. She is saying how it can't be warmed back up, but if people can let me know I have access to a firehouse/hall with an oven and I have access to those pans with the candle underneath them to keep them warm. And she was saying that if we don't have the money that we should call it off. We have everything else paid for besides favors and food. My matron of honor and I will be preparing most of the food it's completely optional for the guests. Where I live it is extremely hard to find places that will cater to where I'm getting married. Am I the asshole for telling her it's our wedding and it's not mandatory it's an option and we are doing a wishing well wedding so we aren't asking for any presents? I just wanna know what you people think

I know how I am as a person and if this isn’t true I do not date people, so when 6 months in I learned from her and friends that she had a storied history of hookups and crazy times in college I was completely shocked. I don’t pass judgement but I know that for me dating someone with such a past just wouldn’t work as I just struggle to handle it. At this point, I feel absolutely horrible as our relationship was mostly good despite some slip ups on her part which I had forgiven her for, but this had just crossed the line and ruined me.

Finally after a couple months he noticed and he said he thought of me as a little sister at most, but give him a year and if he ends up falling for me he'll date me at 19. I of course agreed, and a year goes by and on my 19th birthday he asked me out. I of course said yes, and we were overjoyed. He was an AMAZING partner, he bought me snacks and little care packages when I was on my period, took me on dates, often we would have movie nights, and he'd always make time for me. It was amazing. We didn't do anything till I was 20, and even then it wasn't alot because he just didn't want it to be weird or anything I guess. And on my 22nd birthday I decided to bring him around my family, which was a bad idea because they accused him of grooming me, called the police, he almost got arrested. And after 4 months of this he had enough and broke up with me. We ended up staying friends and still are and it's been about 2 years, but my family brought it up and said I should be glad and I snapped and told them their assholes and how they ruined one of my best relationships, and now most older guys I've met when I was younger are scared to get to close or even touch me infront of them incase they blame them for molesting or grooming me like they did my ex boyfriend now they're all calling me an asshole and not talking to me, and I don't know what to do. I kinda feel like one now

Update: 
I've seen a few ppl call me a asshole for not sticking up for him when I did, especially to this date. I also saw a lot of people telling me to cutt my family off, so I'm doing that and me and him are planning on going on a couple dates, like a vacation type of thing, and might start dating again

More context: 
They had known I knew him, since I was 16 I ALWAYS talked about him( I was a teen girl with a crush) so they knew about him and they'd met him before hand but that was when I reintroduced them and told them how I was dating him, and when they freaked out. Also he almost got arrested because they changed up the story, and made it seem like he was way older and I was way younger when we started to date, they didn't say our actual ages(from what I know) to the police so they probably assumed I was like 13 dating a 20 something year old or something

Edit: 
I don't know what yall want from me! I really don't. I told them stuff, what was I suppose to do! I was a college student and it wasn't like I was always their. I stopped bringing him up and bringing him around but they didn't care and still harassed him through text and calls, I told them multiple times not to, I cried multiple times to my cousins and other close and trusted family members who i thought didnt say anything to him about it only to find they told the others and they blamed him, i made sure to always comfort him, and made sure he was okay mentally but he refused to communicate to me, I was young, and didn't know what to do, tell me what you'd do in that situation? WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ME TO DO!? PLEASE TELL ME! I'm so fucking tired of yall saying shit like this, what did you want me to do, fist fight my whole family and cutt them off when I was only in my early early 20s. Some of yall are saying he shouldn't date me, that I don't deserve a second chance, that I'm the asshole and ect and I don't know why and yall are just saying I didn't stick up for him BUT WHAT DID YOU EXPECT FROM A 22 YEAR OLD WHO WAS BARELY FIGURING OUT WHAT IT MEANT TO BE HAPPY AND HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THAT WASNT TOXIC, OR ABUSIVE! I WAS BARELY LEARNING WHAT REAL LOVE WAS, AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT THE ONLY PEOPLE TO TRULY LOVE ME WAS MY FAMILY, AND THEIRS NOT MUCH I COULD SAY TO DEFEND HIM!

Update: 
My mom contacted me and finally explained why they didn't trust him. His uncle had r@ped my aunt(resulting in one of my cousins) and they heard his dad attempted murder so they just assumed he was as bad. They're willing to put their differences aside and to accept him if it makes me happy, but they've promised if he ever hurts me and they find out they'll make them hurt 10x as much as he hurt me. And for those saying I should put a man I've known for 8 years over people I've known for 24 years then your fucking stupid and that'll never happen, you might do that but me and you are different people. In the 8 years I've known him he's done worse stuff to me and others then the people I've known for 24 years, but the heart wants what it wants and it's been about 2 years since he's seriously hurt me like in the past, and I think he's better. We both have our own trumas and had different ways of dealing with it his ended in physical and emotional pain for both me and him, but he's been able to control his anger and emotions for the past 2 years and I have hope in him."

yozwv7_4279,yozwv7,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Ok this is a long story so im gonna try to he as brief as I can.

I (18 f) cheated on my boyfriend (20 m) with the president of his fraternity (21 m). For privacy i will call them Ben and Jace.

Ben and I have been dating since his senior year of HS and my junior year of HS. Back in those days, I knew he used to get around with girls, which some people view as a red flag. But he was very charming to me, and I started to care less. I was also a virgin so I didnt think I had much of a place to judge his sex life considering i didnt have one of my own. I'm wasnt waiting for marriage or anything, just wanted to feel safe and comfortable and i thought my Ben was going to provide that.

I was wrong. For the first year we dated, he treated my virginity like the plague -- refusing to be on the giving end of any spicy time we may have had. He said that he didnt want to ""ruin"" me, and that always hurt my feelings. 

I met Jace at a party Ben took me to several months before . He was very tall, handsome, flirty, and built.I felt guilty for being attracted to him and stayed clear of him the rest of that night. Jace is the president of the Theta chapter on Ben's campus. I know about him bc him and Ben have a long and ongoing fued. From what some of Bens friends have told me, Jace is very serious about keeping Theta a safe space for his brothers (especially minority students)-- and Jace doesnt feel as though Ben is living up to his pledge committments to maintain the image Jace wants for the house. Because or that, Jace has turned pretty became Ben's bully. Taunting him and roughing him up a lot. 

When Ben got into school he made friends with this girl Sarah, and they have been inseperable every since. I worried about her a lot, espicially when I went to university (my campus is about 90 minutes away from his). Ben always promised that I had nothing to worry about and that they were just friends. When I confronted him about suspicious activities (dodging/lying to me to hang with her, changing her contact name to more innocent titles, finding her things in his place, etc...) he would gaslight me, telling me that i had no right to snoop or question his friendship

It turns out I had every right to worry. I found out during one of my visits to his campus that Ben was cheating on me with Sarah. By cheating, I mean he was sleeping with her pretty much since he got to school. He snuck out of his place to meet up with her when he thought I was asleep. I wasnt, so I followed him to their meet up spot and  I confronted them. It led into a screaming match.

When i left the fight with Ben and Sarah, all i could feel was anger and betrayal. And how unfair it was for Ben to do something like this to me, especially after years of making me feel like i was some sort of sexually pariah. 

He visited me some time after, and apologized, made excuses, etc. I didnt leave him then, because i thought it could work -- only telling him that he'll have to earn my trust again and forcing him to cut off Sarah for good. She was pissed and now has him blocked on everything.

Deep down I was still angry, and didnt fully have the intention of trusting Ben again. When I told my friends, they were just as angry as I was. And then I decided that being cold with him isn't enough -- i wanted to hurt him that same way he hurt me. He deserved to.

I made Ben grovel for a few weeks. Making him think that we were making improvements when in reality i was trying to figure out the best plan of revenge. On his story i saw he was at a party and Jace was in the background. I searched for him on instagram and followed him back (he followed me shortly after meeting me the first time)

I noticed on his page he has been hanging a lot around sarah and decided that he would be perfect -- two birds one stone. He DMed me, saying he's sorry to hear about the situation with Ben. He heard about him cheating through other brothers but didn't know who the girl was. 

I didn't care if he was sincere or not, but i flirted with him anyways. He invited me to a party one weekend when -- hoping to lift my spirits. I took him up on the offer and went back over to their uni. Jace was once again really kind and vaguely flirty, definitely seeming more sincere in person. 

Initially that was the extent of my plan: flirt with Jace and get as comfortable with him as Ben did with Sarah, but keep it platonic to prove that though I won't cross the line, I'm still in the capacity to.

I made sure to make sure other theta brothers saw me laughing and talking with him so that it would eventually get back to Ben. But I might have been giving a stronger message than intented to.  I could tell Jace started to see me in a more than friendly light. Thats when my plan went a little haywire.

At some point in the night, Jace went in for a kiss and I didnt stop him. He was a good kisser, and I figured that this might be an extra sting for Ben when he finds out. But Jace didnt end with a kiss -- and eventually our make out got very heavy very quickly. I warned him that Ben and I weren't officially over, but he said, ""Dont worry, it can be our little secret."" 

I think I just got caught in the moment. He has a really deep voice and the way he held and kissed me felt surreal...I just couldnt bring myself to end it. 

He then took me upstairs and we hooked up. It was really nice, and it didnt hurt as much as everyone warned the first time would. He
was very much a giver in the bedroom and talked me through everything. 

It didnt take long for Ben to find out since people saw us going upstairs. I was up front with him, and told him that he deserves this for what he did to me. He told me that I was an asshole and a ""psychotic bitch"", and has been running my name through the mud ever since. Sarah left me a very long DM slut shaming me before blocked me afterwards. A lot of his friends agree and my friends said that I did go a little too far -- though they understand my feelings. 

I wdon't really see where I went wrong -- I feel like my trust was betrayed first, so Ben deserves to feel every bit of pain i did in both the relationship and his cheating. 

So, am I the asshole?"

It didnt take long for Ben to find out since people saw us going upstairs. I was up front with him, and told him that he deserves this for what he did to me. He told me that I was an asshole and a ""psychotic bitch"", and has been running my name through the mud ever since. Sarah left me a very long DM slut shaming me before blocked me afterwards. A lot of his friends agree and my friends said that I did go a little too far -- though they understand my feelings. 

I wdon't really see where I went wrong -- I feel like my trust was betrayed first, so Ben deserves to feel every bit of pain i did in both the relationship and his cheating. 

So, am I the asshole?"

For all of you asking yes I have I asked my grandparents to stay with them permanently and of course they said yes. Anyway back to the update. I went over to my mother's house for the last time on Sunday and there I got assaulted by my mother she kept punching and kicking me saying that she didn't want me to leave and that I'm her son and that it wasn't a big deal. Police were called, my mother was arrested and let out on bail. I was working on trying to get a restraining order but the police station I went to said I was too young to have one, so I'm asking my grandparents to get one for me but as they're old they're going to have to have a little time. My stepfather after my mother was arrested showed up at my grandparents house asking to see me as 'he wanted to talk' and 'his kids missed me'. My grandparents decided to give up on renovation after that and just decide to move away and they're taking me with them. It's not a big thing is just things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to. so yeah that's the update!"

However, when I was about 14 yo, this all changed. We had a small house that barely fit our family (and that's saying something considering that my family only had 3 members counting myself and my parents). My mother was a dog lover while my father was not. It wasn't that he hated dogs, it was just that he never cared about them and just tolerated them. At first, everything was fine, we had 3 dogs and they were very well taken care of. We placed the dogs near our owned transient house. However, the dogs became a problem for the people renting the transient house. Soon enough, various complaints were released about the dogs, the noise, and everything. It was to the point where it was ruining the business. The place was rated so low, almost nobody wanted to go and rent the place. My father, who was a businessman, immediately noticed the problem and demanded from my mom how she needed to lessen the number of dogs. My mother who absolutely loved the dogs disagreed and said that she wanted to keep them.

It started with simple disagreements, my father convinced my mother to remove the dogs, and my mother disagreed and begged to keep them. But it escalated into arguments, my mother started to argue back and even told my father how he was an apathetic monster for wanting to abandon dogs. Their relationship quickly turned sour, to the point where both of them couldn't even go on for a day without arguing about something. The last straw was when my mother went back home holding a dog, apparently, she pitied the dog and wanted to find a perfect house for the dog. I knew it was a lie, and so did my father. We both knew that she took the dog because she wanted to keep it. She told my father how she wanted to move our other dogs to our house instead, along with the dog she picked up ""while she was waiting for someone to adopt the dog"". My father disagreed because our house was small and the dogs aren't exactly small dogs. This turned into a big argument, it got so bad my mother demanded a divorce from my father. My father who wanted a whole family asked me to give my opinion on it. They explained themselves and why they have the opinions they currently have. I, of course, gave my honest opinion to them and told them that I also believed the dogs were really becoming a problem. My mother was livid, she cried, screamed, and told me how I had no idea how dogs gave light to her life and how I was acting like my father whom she believed was a monster. Since then she started acting cold to me and my dad. She was no longer the same warm and loving mom I grew up with. It affected me really badly, and I started blaming dogs for what happened in my family. I knew I was being petty for hating the creatures who had nothing to do with what happened with my family but I still couldn't help but blame them. I didn't want to see them, and even though my mind knew I was being absolutely ridiculous, I still couldn't help but hate them. So I started shooing them out of my sight and threw rocks whenever I saw one. It wasn't until a friend pointed out how I was being ridiculous for hurting dogs who were doing absolutely nothing to me that I realized what I was doing and made me rethink.

So am I the asshole for hating and shooing away dogs, even if it meant I needed to be a little violent?

PS: I hope I was able to point out the whole event well, English was not my first language so I might have some grammar mistakes."

My husband brought this up last night and asking me that his ex wife apartment complex is kicking everyone out because they want to renovate the complex. Because she have bad credit,  she needs to get another apartment she has to up front 2 months rent. She also has a cat so the cat deposit fee. She ask my husband for 2K to help her and her son out. Now it’s getting close to Christmas and I do feel for her but we have our own debts to pay and my husband would have to borrow money from his dad to help her out. It bothers me that he can fish out money that we don’t have when we are still paying off our debt. Also I would like to add that when my husband and his ex wife got divorced she was entitled to half of his retirement. Now she wanted my husband  to cash out that money even taking the tax on it. But my husband said no. So she never pulled out the money. If my husband gives her the 2K, he said it would go towards his retirement and that his lawyer will draft up the document. My husband explains it’s going to help in the  long run but idk. I’m having mix feelings. So am I the asshole?

Edit- the little man 10 hr old boy isn’t going to be homeless. He always have a place to stay with us. We just live in another county. Also my husband ex wife is 18 yrs older than my husband( she was his first love, not judging) . So if some of you guys are thinking she is young. She isn’t."

My mom just found out that I gave her the address of my virtual mailbox when I moved across the country (US) two years ago and is hurt that I never gave her my real address. 

About 3 years ago when I moved in with my fiancé I gave her my address and everything was fine until one day my sister in law dropped by unannounced with herself, her mom, her sister, and her two kids. She also told the kids they could sleep over. 

I and my fiancé were really put off by them showing up out of nowhere, especially because we were having friends over that day and they completely interrupted our day for me to now have to take my sister in law and her family on a tour and out to lunch (they wanted to go out to lunch because they didn’t want the food I’d made for our friends, which I did offer) and then they told the kids they could sleep over. The house was a small one bedroom and I told them that no, the kids will not be staying. 

So when we moved my fiancé and I mutually decided to not tell anyone our address (even his parents) so we could avoid any and all unwanted visitors and generally for our safety. So we got a virtual address. 

No one even questioned it until now, my mom finally I guess googled the address and found it’s a virtual office and she texted me angrily asking why she can’t have my address and that she’ll never bother me again, that she feels like such a fool, and that she “hopes I remember this in the future.” 

I replied and said it has nothing to do with her, and that I just don’t want anyone knowing my address. Now she’s radio silent and won’t speak to me. 

So, AITA? 

Tl;dr: I won’t give my real address to my mom because I don’t want uninvited visitors, now she won’t speak to me."

ypwg7y_4326,ypwg7y,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"My aunt owned some properties around town. I am living in/renting one house that she promised to leave to me when she died, but because I never saw the will, I wasn’t counting on it.

A friend of hers was living in another of her houses, rent-free for many years. It was assumed this friend was fixing up the place in exchange for rent. It’s a very old house that really needed work. My aunt made a handshake deal she would leave that house to them. The neighborhood knew, because we live in a small town and people talk.

She died and an old, handwritten will signed by witnesses was found in her house. The lawyers authenticated it and it is legitimate. It was written after her friend moved in.

She left the house I live in and the other house to me. Everyone was shocked, including me. I now own them outright.

I live on a very fixed budget, but I have some savings. I’m getting on in years and, before this, I was planning on working till the day I die. I want to use that house as a rental to bring in some passive income.

Using my savings, I offered this friend a large sum of money to move, large enough for a down payment on a nice house in the area. They countered and asked for more. We negotiated to a larger sum than my original offer. They move out in 3 weeks. The lawyer has the check to deliver to them upon vacancy.

When I went to look at the property, it was a mess. Plaster falling off the walls, water damage, no electrical, bad roof, etc. There wasn’t even an indoor toilet. So, this person apparently re-plastered the interior (poorly) and stopped all work.

This person is well liked in the community and people have been coming out of the woodwork to share their opinion of what I’ve done. Even my cousin has written some slanderous posts on Facebook, painting me as an evil Scrooge and this friend as someone who built this gorgeous house by hand and it’s being stolen from them, leaving them homeless; going so far as to accuse me of secretly changing the will in my favor. They’ve “gone viral” in the community. A local pastor left a note at my house calling me to repentance.

I haven’t said anything to anyone because I don’t know what to say and it would only lead to more vigorous debate and aggression. I feel horrible, but I don’t know if I should."

For context his sister is married to my brother who is not my sibling but a distant brother and is a bit older than me, but as I lived with my grandma and grandpa he lived next house to them and basically babysat me everytime, he married to J's sister and whenever J visited we'd play and often spend time together (we were 5-6 at the time). Over the years him and I really stayed close and he's always been there for me. My brother and his wife moved out to live in other country but we kept contact, and as I said I stayed close with J. I always called him my brother. We never ever had any other sort of relationship, I really look at him as my brother. 
Now onto the story, J is now living in another city bc of college and me in another. We see eachother a few times over the year but we will talk on the phone once or twice a week to catch up and talk. My boyfriend (24m) know about that story, my friendshop and why I call J my brother (he really helped me out when no one was there for me and genuinely is a good person), they met in person, we've been on a dinner together etc, the point is he knows about my friendship and connection with J. 
The other day J came back as a surprise, and we met up, he brought me a bouquet bc he wasn't there when I dropped college and moved out from my father's house (we are in bad terms), all in two months, and he wanted to make me feel better. After the meet up I went to my boyfriends place as we planned it, and there was his father asking me about flowers, my connection with J, and said as he's not my blood relative I must've been cheating on my boyfriend. And my boyfriend goes and says ""I always thought about that"". I stood there in shock. Big tears dropped from my eyes and I said that they are in wrong and I love J as I would love my sibling. I grabbed my jacket and left. He tried following me and reassuring that his father said that jokingly ( he did not), and said that at the end his father might be right bc J and I are not brother and sister,he feels bad because he think I'll choose J over him and maybe we should just distance one from another ( J and I), and him and I could work things out. I said no way, that he should manage his jelaousy and grow up as not every male-female friendship is just fucking with each other, that he'd knew that if he had girl friends he had not f*cked (yes he had best friend and they had s*x in the past, and when we got together she got mad and threatend me she would beat me, thay ended things then or I think they did), my friend doesn't comfort me with post breakup s*x but with trip to my favorite coffee shop or with my favorite ice cream. 
I really love him but I can't stand this behaviour as I did nothing wrong and really have the best friendship with J who's been there in good and in bad. Every other boyfriend didn't mind that, but I think my current is projecting his behaviour on me. 
WIBTA if I break up, because I don't want to lose my best friend who helped me so much, but I feel like the a-hole because I'm proving my boyfriend that I'll choose my friend over him?"

yqcg06_4338,yqcg06,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"My friend (M20) and I (F21)both live in Texas, very conservative state which does not allow abortions even in cases of incest or rape, and little to no restrictions on guns. 
   I always knew my friend was republican but I always brushed it off to the side because he was genuinely a nice person and didn’t really talk about it much. We’ve been friends since middle school and the thought of losing my friend breaks my heart.
  I was able to brush it off his opinions until this midterm election. I found out he voted for Greg Abott for governor who has done very questionable things such as saying “it could have been worse” in response to the Uvalde school shooting, the failure of our electric grid, claiming to eliminate rape while having done nothing to achieve that and so much more that I won’t get into right now.
  I’ve had conversations with my friend about his beliefs a few months prior to the election. He said he was pro choice but he also wanted to “keep guns.” My friend didn’t fully understand the laws that Greg Abott had passed so I educated him about it. I told him how abortions were banned even in cases of rape and incest, how pregnant women are literally dying because doctors wait till they’re on their deathbed to perform an abortion, how Greg Abott made it possible to have permitless carry with little to no background checks, Uvalde shooting etc. I also explained how the other candidate wasn’t looking to get rid of guns but at least make sure red flag laws are in place and a permit needed to carry. He seemed to understand my point of view at the time and was even sympathetic towards it.

   When I asked my friend why he voted for Greg Abott he said he wanted to keep his guns. 
  I understand that not everyone is going to agree on everything, especially when it comes to politics. I care about my friend a lot and we’ve been friends for so long. However, I don’t think I can ignore the fact the he voted against my bodily autonomy and that he considers guns to be more important than women’s rights.
  I told him I wasn’t sure how we could be friends anymore and he asked why. I told him that I just don’t like the fact that he chose guns over a woman’s right to choose. He was very confused and somewhat hurt. He asked me to elaborate more but I was just so overwhelmed that I didn’t want to talk about it anymore because the damage was already done. I hung up and he tried to call me back multiple times but I’ve just ignored him so far.

Every year we have 3 weeks where we do lots of fun things and workshops instead of real lessons and that was this week. M had already in palmed 2 kids of our class with fake depression and fear disorders. We had a workshop where we had to draw our own tattoos which I'm good at and I like very much. M started touching her arms like they hurted the entire time and lots of girls didn't say anything or think much of it. Then one of my GUY friends looked at the girl next to M to ask something and didn't even look near M's arm. She started making hurtful faces and she rolled her sleeve up with cuts all over her arm but not even deep, they just looked like cat scratches but not even as deep as that. He asked: ""Bro what the hell is that?"" M just goes like ""Oh well I have depression so."" She said it as loud as possible. He just brushed it off thinking she wouldn't want to talk about it in front of the whole class. (We were sitting with 16 on a long table entirely full, everyone could hear anything.) Then M started talking, more like yelling. ""I have been raped multiple times and I'm depressed....."" He laughed because in the way M said it and how she didn't know any of us cause nobody really talked to her in the 2 days she was in our class, he just knew it was fake. It happened to me and I got really mad for her faking such a thing. When she finally got a special tattoo pen to tattoo her drawing on herself, she started shaking her hands a lot which she didn't while drawing. She called for a teacher and put her hand in the air yelling causing everyone to look: ""I have a fear disorder I don't think I can do this."" The teacher said that she'll be fine and we won't get grades for it anyways. She was silent for 10 Minutes. When she started talking to my friend again about how horrible her life is and things like that. Then she started raising her voice while talking and lots of people were looking at her. My friend started laughing and a friend of M started saying how horrible that is and you shouldn't laugh at someone else their trauma. This is where I go in. I have never learned from anyone how to say things properly without being rude and I am working on it a lot, just thought I'd mention, doesn't change what I said. While still drawing peacefully on my paper I calmly said: ""Just shut the hell up both of you, of course he is laughing I mean she is totally faking it can't you see she learned her acting from Amber Heard? And even if she wasn't faking who the hell yells these things infront of a class where she doesn't know anyone and then to a guy who is a total idiot with no compassion or empathy?"" She got up and walked out of the room. I was lucky the teacher wasn't there but my friend was glad I said it because he was getting really annoyed by her, and I quote, ' Her attention seeker, Pick-me behaviour'. (His words, not mine.) (He didn't mind what I said about him because he knows he is like that and is used to me calling him idiot.) After school I heard her talking at the busstop to another friend sayin a girl is ruining her in getting boy friends in her class and is onto her. Well after that I was 100% sure she was faking it. She saw me walking by and now M looks disgusting at me everytime she sees me and her friend demands that I apologise. A part if the class thinks I was right to say that but maybe I should've said it differently and didn't make a little grin at the end, the other part of the class is staying out of it. So AITA and should I apologise?

PS: 1. There are a few people at the busstop and I'm good at hearing and recognising voices.
       2. MENTAL ILLNESS OR NOT RAPE/DISORDERS/ILLNESSES IS NOTHING TO BE FAKING AND HAVING A MENTAL ILLNESS IS NO FREE PASS FOR IT.

UPDATE:
I went to the counselor today and she is going to talk to her and her parents, she isn't allowed to tell me if she really is faking or not. But if she is faking she is forced to apologise to the whole class for giving us such ideas, if she isn't faking then she will call me to apologise to her.

UPDATE 2:
So I totally forgot to do an update but I was right, she was faking all those disabilities, she had to apologise to the entire class. She apologised to everyone separately and told them to keep it secret. The school talked to the parents who signed her up for some psychology things and therapy. Most of the class don't talk to her because she was faking trauma's real people had and all that. I didn't forgive her for that but I did help her a lot at school ( Socialising ) Which I'm very bad at, me and people is not a good match. We're now friends but still a little mad.

I do see now that I shouldn't have asumed she was faking becaude I heard her talking that she was. And all those other obvious signs. I mostly try to keep myself out of everything, it just slipped that day, I'm sorry."

So me(26F) and my significant other(24M) moved to Michigan together last year (June 2021) and we were living with his friends family. We were going through some issues and my significant other ended up moving out quite a bit before me. This family we were living with 2 women (35 and 50) and their daughter (18) really hit it off with me and kind of became like my family. They were there for me, even when my significant other was not and i had nobody else in this state.

Fast forward to March 2022 and me and my significant other are good again, he is on bipolar meds and things are looking up. we take a weekend trip to chicago with some friends from our hometown. While we were gone my significant other gave the family a key to his apartment so they could bring in his hello fresh order for him. Once we got back it was disclosed to me that while we were gone, the 50F son(21M) aka the friend of my significant other used his key to go into his apartment, eat his food, go through his things, and have sex with someone in his bed. super fucked up. they told me about it and were not going to tell my significant other so i told them straight up that i thought that was fucked up and i was gonna tell him, so i did. he tried to address it with every member of the family and they all dismissed him and acted like he was making a big deal out of nothing. My significant other retaliated by reporting his friend for something and getting him in some pretty big trouble. Needless to say, my significant other and that family no longer have a relationship but I was still living with them.

I moved out into my own apartment in June of 2022 and i havent really seen or spoken to that family since despite them wanting to see me and us making plans a couple of times and them getting cancelled for whatever reason. I am on my sig others side and have kept my distance. But every friday night my sig other has been playing DnD with his friends and i have class early on saturday so i do not join. This family invited me to come over for pizza this Friday (tomorrow) and i told them sure but i wont stay long because i have to study for my exam saturday. I told my sig other about it and he is pretty upset and says he feels betrayed that i am still willing to see them and speak with them and i have tried to explain that their beef really doesnt involve me, but he disagrees. I dont think it is betrayal because my relationship with them is just different and they never wronged me. He wants me to cancel but it makes me feel bad because i already said yes and what not so i just need to know...AITA in this situation and i SHOULD cancel/cut them out of my life?

I feeel like i also should mention that me and my significant other are actually legally married, we just don't have a conventional relationship because we had some issues we needed to work through and what not."

My coworker whom I’ll call Kelly was complaining today that she hasn’t been feeling well for about 2 weeks and thinks she might be sick. So asked her if she has been tested or anything, but she said that she doesn’t want to go get tested. She went on to say that if she doesn’t get tested then she isn’t sick. I had to stop myself from asking her if she was really that stupid. Instead knowing that she has kids I asked her, if you think you’re pregnant and you don’t take a pregnancy test does that mean you’re not pregnant? She gave me a blank stare then said that this was completely different and I had no idea what I was talking about! I was steaming, I looked at her and said “You are a huge part of the problem, you come to work sick and now so many people are unnecessarily sick!” I walked straight to the store manager and told her what happened. Now the entire store has to undergo a mandatory covid test. 
So I need to know AITAH

Edit:
I had covid once already and really don’t want it again. As far as I know she hasn’t had it and I really hope she doesn’t get it."

Her parents coddled her too much she is very entitled.She feels shouldn't have to ask me to use things in her own house. she is whiney and lazy like peg bundy. I don't want her to ask permission I just like to know why she does certain things she has avery negative outlook on life.life is not supposed to  be easy."
ysskf0_4434,ysskf0,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (40f) have been with my partner (47m) for a few years.  I’m divorced and have 2 kids.  3 years ago, my mother passed away after a long period of illness and my sister and I inherited her house, which I’ve lived in for a few years after caring for her.  It’s a great house and we’re in a very privileged position, and are particularly grateful for it after a long period of family illness, abuse and divorce, depression etc.  

When I met my partner, he moved in straight away due to covid lockdowns.  He has a few kids from previous relationships, all with different mums.  I was happy to share my house with them.  He hasn’t worked since I’ve known him, but pays rent on time every week (which covers bills and “rent”/rates/insurance which I also pay) from a benefit, but doesn’t have any money left over so I always have to cover any other household expense and food.  I barely have enough to get by for my kids and I, but then I also have to financially cover him and whichever of his kids visit for the weekend.  They treat the house like a charity shop.. they’ll go into my kids room and come out saying “look dad I found this, can I keep it?” and although it’s obviously my kids and I’ve bought it, not that we have random free stuff lying around the house, he says yes.  Hairbrushes, toiletries, clothing.. nothing is sacred, they use everything because he doesn’t provide it for them.  I give them their own things and they take it back to their mums house or lose it.  I buy 2 of everything for my kids and have to hide it for when it’s just them, or buy extra for his kids.  I can’t afford it and he knows that, but because I own the house and he doesn’t own anything, he has the attitude that I owe him.

ysskf0_4436,ysskf0,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"I (40f) have been with my partner (47m) for a few years.  I’m divorced and have 2 kids.  3 years ago, my mother passed away after a long period of illness and my sister and I inherited her house, which I’ve lived in for a few years after caring for her.  It’s a great house and we’re in a very privileged position, and are particularly grateful for it after a long period of family illness, abuse and divorce, depression etc.  

When I met my partner, he moved in straight away due to covid lockdowns.  He has a few kids from previous relationships, all with different mums.  I was happy to share my house with them.  He hasn’t worked since I’ve known him, but pays rent on time every week (which covers bills and “rent”/rates/insurance which I also pay) from a benefit, but doesn’t have any money left over so I always have to cover any other household expense and food.  I barely have enough to get by for my kids and I, but then I also have to financially cover him and whichever of his kids visit for the weekend.  They treat the house like a charity shop.. they’ll go into my kids room and come out saying “look dad I found this, can I keep it?” and although it’s obviously my kids and I’ve bought it, not that we have random free stuff lying around the house, he says yes.  Hairbrushes, toiletries, clothing.. nothing is sacred, they use everything because he doesn’t provide it for them.  I give them their own things and they take it back to their mums house or lose it.  I buy 2 of everything for my kids and have to hide it for when it’s just them, or buy extra for his kids.  I can’t afford it and he knows that, but because I own the house and he doesn’t own anything, he has the attitude that I owe him.  He’s poor so he should automatically get whatever he wants from around my house, even though I inherited it, I’m not making bank.  I’m starting to really resent it.  I can’t talk to him about it because then it turns into him saying I don’t like his kids, he stormed off the one time I suggested he get a job.

I feel like I’m being used as a lawn service and want to say no to this request. I feel like I am totally being the asshole in this situation since my Aunt just lost a husband and doing some yard work is no real problem.

ytceco_4455,ytceco,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"My (20F) partner (20M) has ADHD and I can't take it anymore. I told him how much it bothers me and he called me a ableist asshole, that I have no idea what it's like in his head and that I don't do anything else than nag him.

I know it's not his fault. i understand its incredibly difficult for him. i try my best to help him. but he blames everything on it. 

1. if he says something that hurts me he blames it on ADHD. 

2. he won't let me talk about my interests cause he finds it boring so his brain can't focus on it. 

3.he always picks what we watch or do. if I'm at home when he comes home from work he will take the remote put of my hand and switch to something he wants to watch because what I watch is to boring for him. 

4. he gets angry easily and if he has a bad day the entire family has one 

5. he can't remember anything so all the mental bits of running a household goes on me. I even have to remind him of his own doctors appointments and if I don't he gets annoyed at me for him forgetting it
he says he'll help out in the house but never does it cause he can't get started and if he ever gets started it takes him 3 days to clean 4 plates and by that time it's built up alot more dishes. 

6. he spends money we don't have on things he uses for a week. like a 500£ mountain bike or random stuff from amazon.
ofcourse I try to support him the best I can but we really can't afford it. 

7. he will play 12 hours a day of Minecraft two weeks in a row, then switch ti the next game and then the next and the probbaly circle it back. 

8. he misses out on everything his daughter (17months) does because he's always busy with his hobbies and in his own words ""can't stop to focus on something else"" and thinks she's boring because she can't talk yet. 

but today was the last straw. he's had the last 3 days off and spent the entire time between being awake til going to bed playing Minecraft. he didn't even stop to eat the dinner i made him and I worked really hard on it to give him a nice surprise.
today we were gonna go for a walk togheter all 3 of us before the sunset. he agreed to this and from an hour before I said ""it's an hour left, now it's 30 minutes left, now it's 15 minutes left time to get ready, 5 minutes til we leave"" so he could mentally prepare. he kept saying just one minute, just one second. and then never stops, we ended up leaving without him. he promised he would catch up with us. we came back 2 hours later and he hadn't even moved from the spot.
this is not the first time something like this has happened. whenever it is something important to me he can't be bothered cause he doesn't want to go outside or its to boring for him. 

am i the asshole? am I being spoiled? or am I just not understanding enough? how can I help him more...I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like a single parent with two children but I only gave birth to one.

edit: note:  all my family lives in a totally different country and I'm a sahm so I have no where to go and I'm not a citizen either"

ytdy2m_4462,ytdy2m,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"For a bit of background my (22f) Brother (25m) married my SIL (31f) last year. Im going to try to keep this short and sweet but we will see. 

I’ve never been someone to like a lot of people or go out of my way to try to get to know people, however, when my brother brought his new girlfriend home I went out of my way to be nice and get to know her and it seemed as though we would get along fine. Then the bullshit started. There have been multiple cases of drama and arguments but I want to focus on the one that was my breaking point. If you want some other instances later on let me know I’ll do a separate story on that. My SIL has never liked my boyfriend. Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 2 years now and when he is in the room she pretends like he doesn’t even exist. He will talk to her or try to be a part of whatever conversation is happening and she doesn’t even acknowledge he’s spoken. He isn’t allowed at there house or around their baby. She claims to have a reason for not liking him but because it is personal I will leave out her reason (it has nothing to do with him personally). Since finding out her reason she stated that she does want to get to know him and that they want to come to our house Christmas morning (me and my boyfriend still live with my mom) so that me, my boyfriend, my mom, her and my brother can have a little Christmas together before getting together with the rest of my family. This was a few months ago that she said this. 

Now onto the actual reason I’m going no contact. This morning I was talking to my mom on the phone and we were talking about Christmas plans and she told me that my brother and his wife want to have Christmas at their house this year. However only I am invited. My boyfriend can not attend. My mom asked why and she stated that her family doesn’t celebrate with people that are not married/engaged. We are all calling bs on that. Last year we held Christmas at my grandparents house and everyone was there including my boyfriend and SIL and there were no issues. Also the Christmas celebration held at their house this year will just be our immediate family. No one in her family will be there. My brother asked her “what will you do when they get engaged” and she simply responded “I will deal with that when the time comes”. My mom told my brother that if I have given this ultimatum to either come to their house alone without my boyfriend or not go at all then I will not go. She is absolutely correct. I will not go to a place where me and my boyfriend are not accepted together. If the reasoning for her not liking him we’re different then I would understand (like if he was a bad person or did something that made her uncomfortable) but this reasoning is just dumb. Also I feel like I need to add she comes from a very religious family who is against a lot of things and my boyfriend is a 6’3 large guy with tattoos and gauges. So from the outside he looks like one thing but on the inside he is very much the definition of golden retriever energy. He is kind, funny, goofy, and he has a huge heart. I know part of the reason she judges him is because of the way he looks.

So I called my brother today and told him I will not be attending their house for Christmas and I will be going no contact with her. I have no Ill feelings towards my brother because she has been manipulating him and gaslighting him throughout their entire relationship and he is just trying to keep the peace. He understands and respects my decision. He said we will find some time Christmas Day for us to be able to see each other really quick. We said a few other things then got off of the phone in a positive way I know there are no issues between me and him which is all that matters to me. 

I don’t think I’m in the wrong for deciding to just completely cut her off, however, when I spoke to my mom she seemed upset but understood. She said she wishes I would have waited until it was completely set in stone that my boyfriend could’ve attended before making any decisions or saying anything. The way I see it even if it was an option for him not to come that’s enough for me. Also at this point if she says he can come it will just be out of pity. I haven’t spoken to my SIL at all about any of this because to be honest I just have no interest in talking to her or seeing her. Like I said before there have been many other instances of drama this is just the one that brought me to the point of being completely done. 

So I just want to know if I am overreacting or if I am justified. I know I said I would keep this short and sweet but apparently I had more to say than I realized. 

Also I’m sorry if this is kind of chaotic. This is my first post and my brain kind of goes all over the place so if something doesn’t make sense let me know and I will explain better. 

So AITA?

ytnfqd_4469,ytnfqd,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (20M) arranged a meeting with my GF (20F) a few days ago to tell her that I needed a break. Things weren't going well between us, and I wrote her a letter to explain to her why I needed this break and what I expected. She remained in silence for a long time, then she got up and started walking away. I followed her because that's what she expects me to do in these situations, but she barely replied to me when I asked her where we were going or what she was doing.

Anyway, we stop on the street and she starts crying. She says I was an asshole to do this in a public place (I already told her many times before that we were gonna have a serious talk and I didn't feel like planning the rest of the day together with her because of it). I took her on a less crowded street and tried to comfort her while keeping my distance. However the minutes passed, then a half-hour or more, then she started crying. She didn't stop. I asked her if she wanted me to accompany he home by taking the bus with her but she didn't respond. Eventually I have in and hugged her to show her some support and compassion.

I asked her if she wanted to be alone, she didn't respond, then if she wanted me to accompany her home or to the station. She decided that it was a good idea to go to my place to ""talk"", and I said okay because I already hurt her feelings and didn't want to do it again. That was my first mistake.

Long story short, we start cuddling and then we have sex. I didn't do it with the intention of abusing her because of her emotional state or anything, it's just that one thing led to another and I thought that she wanted to (she didn't say no or show in any way that she didn't want to, I even asked her and she said yes). She then accused me of 'treating her badly' because of this and because, during the break, I texted her like I said I would (and she just replied with ""okay"", while now she said she wasn't okay with it actually because I was ""incoherent"").

ytzjpo_4476,ytzjpo,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"So some background. I (21M) have 3 sisters and 3 brothers. 2 of my brothers are closer in age with me (19M,17M) while one is only new born.

My sisters are Sarah (4F), Lisa and Lindsay (twins 3F).

So basically this whole story starts with me being out shopping with my grandmother, we see build a bear and decide to pop in since we used to visit it quite frequently when I was Sarah’s age. While inside and having a look around I seen a deal that interested me quite a bit. You can bring your child into the store during their birthday month and get them a bear for the age they will be.

Sarah’s birthday is at the end of this month and I decided to take her to build a bear instead of buying her a gift as I assumed it would be something she’d enjoy and would be a good memory for her.

She loved it, loved picking her bear and watching it get made and then picking out an outfit and dressing the bear.

Afterwards we went to McDonald’s and I got her lunch and before leaving the shopping centre I stopped into a sweet shop. I let Sarah pick out a sweet and bought a few for my twin sisters.

When I got Sarah home she was excited to show our mother her bear as our mother thought I was just taking her to McDonald’s since I didn’t want to ruin the surprise. I gave my twin sisters the sweets but I could see them looking at Sarah’s bear.

I sat for a while and played with them. Sarah let them have a turn with her bear.

In my opinion all was fine until my mother pulled me aside. Told me I should’ve told her I was going to build a bear and she would’ve asked to come with my younger sisters as it’s unfair that Sarah got a present and they didn’t. 

I explained that Sarah’s bear was a birthday gift and that since I was set on getting her one I wanted her to have the experience of being there. I explained that when it came to my twin sisters birthdays I would be taking them as well and they’d get everything Sarah got.

My mother still seemed annoyed at this and said I should’ve at least hid the bear to bring round on Sarah’s birthday as it was an asshole move since the twins will only see it as Sarah getting something and them not getting something. This annoyed me since it was Sarah’s bear and I didn’t want to hold onto it until her birthday as it isn’t until the end of this month and I took her one of the only days I have free this month due to exams.

My mother just went in a mood with me overall saying I was an asshole for not even telling her where I was going so she couldn’t give me money towards getting the twins one or offering to take her and the twins. At this I explained I wanted the experience to be Sarah and I. I wanted her to remember her big brother taking her out and buying her a gift since one of my best birthday memories is my uncle taking me out on my birthday and buying me my Xbox.

I felt bad since the twins looked sad that Sarah had a fancy new bear with an outfit.

So AITAH?"
ytzjpo_4478,ytzjpo,top-comment,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"So some background. I (21M) have 3 sisters and 3 brothers. 2 of my brothers are closer in age with me (19M,17M) while one is only new born.

My sisters are Sarah (4F), Lisa and Lindsay (twins 3F).

So basically this whole story starts with me being out shopping with my grandmother, we see build a bear and decide to pop in since we used to visit it quite frequently when I was Sarah’s age. While inside and having a look around I seen a deal that interested me quite a bit. You can bring your child into the store during their birthday month and get them a bear for the age they will be.

Sarah’s birthday is at the end of this month and I decided to take her to build a bear instead of buying her a gift as I assumed it would be something she’d enjoy and would be a good memory for her.

She loved it, loved picking her bear and watching it get made and then picking out an outfit and dressing the bear.

Afterwards we went to McDonald’s and I got her lunch and before leaving the shopping centre I stopped into a sweet shop. I let Sarah pick out a sweet and bought a few for my twin sisters.

When I got Sarah home she was excited to show our mother her bear as our mother thought I was just taking her to McDonald’s since I didn’t want to ruin the surprise. I gave my twin sisters the sweets but I could see them looking at Sarah’s bear.

I sat for a while and played with them. Sarah let them have a turn with her bear.

In my opinion all was fine until my mother pulled me aside. Told me I should’ve told her I was going to build a bear and she would’ve asked to come with my younger sisters as it’s unfair that Sarah got a present and they didn’t. 

I explained that Sarah’s bear was a birthday gift and that since I was set on getting her one I wanted her to have the experience of being there. I explained that when it came to my twin sisters birthdays I would be taking them as well and they’d get everything Sarah got.

My mother still seemed annoyed at this and said I should’ve at least hid the bear to bring round on Sarah’s birthday as it was an asshole move since the twins will only see it as Sarah getting something and them not getting something. This annoyed me since it was Sarah’s bear and I didn’t want to hold onto it until her birthday as it isn’t until the end of this month and I took her one of the only days I have free this month due to exams.

My mother just went in a mood with me overall saying I was an asshole for not even telling her where I was going so she couldn’t give me money towards getting the twins one or offering to take her and the twins. At this I explained I wanted the experience to be Sarah and I. I wanted her to remember her big brother taking her out and buying her a gift since one of my best birthday memories is my uncle taking me out on my birthday and buying me my Xbox.

I felt bad since the twins looked sad that Sarah had a fancy new bear with an outfit.

I reported the threats as witness intimidation, and now a now ex friend told me to fuck off, because that security guy is her co worker, and says he was just trying to provoke me.

The Story: \*It's important to know that the following has become a common occurrence in the last six months and is the root of most of our arguments\* (Sorry for the length)

We had not spent any time together in several days so when he got home from work at 11 p.m. on Thursday, I called him and asked if I could come over to spend some time with him. He was off the next day and I am self-employed so the late hours are generally not an issue. He tells me that he and a friend, Zach, are going to have a game night and that we could hang out when they were done. I waited up until 3:45 a.m. before I gave up and went to sleep. We had texted a few times throughout the evening and I believed they were together and playing their game. I did not hear from him again until 4:30 the next afternoon when I texted and told him we needed to talk and that I was coming over. At that time I discovered Zach did not even show up until 5 a.m., and it wasn't just the two of them but a small group of friends (guys and girls) that he never hangs out with if I'm around. He stayed up all night and into the next day with them. Everyone left around noon, but he didn't think to text me until 4:30 p.m. I show up at his house around 6 p.m. and after a short talk, he says he is coming to spend the night at my house with me and that he will follow behind me in a half an hour. At 10:30 p.m. after 3 ""where are you?"" phone calls he finally shows up. He proceeds to eat an entire pizza (I had ordered 2) and promptly goes to my bed and goes to sleep. I spent the evening by myself listening to him snore. When he wakes up the next day, there are no apologies and he can't understand why I'm upset. He goes to work and I don't speak to him again until 10 p.m. We make plans to see each other that evening. We would meet at his house and stay there for a few hours so he could play on his computer for a while and then go back to my house since he is off on Sunday and my kids come home from their dads. We get there at 12:30 a.m. and I entertain myself while he plays on his computer until 5:30 a.m. When I tell him we need to go, he starts to make excuses and complain. After 45 minutes of going back and forth, I leave without him but he promised to be right behind me and that he would see me in a few minutes. After 2 hours of waiting, I call him and discover that instead of heading to my house he has chosen to go to sleep at his. He apologizes and says he is up and just needs to eat something and he will head over. 2 more hours pass so I call again. This time he answers (he was asleep again) and yells at me for calling. After we hang up, I get a text message that says he will come over if he gets just 2 more hours of sleep. At this point, I'm exhausted and need to sleep myself so I just say fine and take a nap. 4 and a half hours later I get a text that says he is ready to come over. No follow-up text. No phone call. When I text back I am angry and I tell him why and lay it all out for him. I tell him that I'm going to start seeking out someone who actually wants to be with me and his response is that he will not tolerate ultimatums and that I am suffocating him and being selfish and then he chooses to ignore me and has not been in contact with me since. That was almost 3 hours ago. I am not a stupid woman and I see the red flags but this is new behavior and I have 8 years in this relationship. I do not think he has cheated, but I do know that he has recently told a few people that we are no longer together (he denied this when I asked) So my question is - Am I justified in threatening to look for someone new or am I being selfish and overbearing?"

I had a dad but he ignored all the red flags and stayed with my mother even after how she treated her kids especially me. She had favorites and you could tell and being the youngest and most unwanted child I was definitely the least favorite. When she wasn't at work, asleep, or drinking, she was on her phone ignoring her three kids (me and my two siblings). At a young age I learned telling her my problems would end with me getting yelled at or her crying because I ""Made her feel like a bad mother and that I don't love her"". She ruined most events for me by yelling at me and making me cry or getting drunk and doing something stupid. At my 8th birthday party her and my aunt got drunk and threw the food, Including half of my birthday cake at eachother. She would get drunk on Saturdays and when I would do something slightly not to her liking she would yell and say I was the reason she drank so much alcohol and she was so stressed. I always felt horrible with her calling me fat or stupid and I have always held those words in my mind and I had a horrible self Image. So I started saving money at 11 and now, at 18 I'm moving in with a few friends in a small house we're renting and when she heard she was mad. She texted me when I was taking the last of my stuff into my bedroom asking if she was such a bad mom.  The text went something like this ""Wow. I can't believe after all the love and time I gave to you and you want to move out at just 18 with no goodbye to your mother or father! I cared for you and for what am I really such a bad mother"" now keep in mind the text was a lot longer but excluding all the personal things that were said that sums it up great. I really want to tell her what I feel but I didn't want to be rude so I asked a friend if it would be rude and she said it'd be a bit mean and made me seem like an A-hole. So now I'm wondering would I be the ah?"

When our food arrived 14f started giving food to my 5f (she loves kids) 5f was giggling happily they both get along very well. My MIL tried to feed my daughter 6 times and she said no but she kept trying to push it.

Then my MIL told 14f to stop doing that 14f rolled her eyes and I told MIL that it was fine. After that MIL tried to give food to 5f and 5f very loudly said “Noooooo, I don’t wanna eat from your hand you haven’t showered in 4 weeks it’s dirty and it smells” at that point everyone looked at our table and laughed. My MIL told my husband to discipline 5f he said “mum shes a kid I’m not gonna start beating her”. My MIL started calling me names.

My husband told her he won’t let her disrespect his wife (me) and told her she can pay for her own bill. MIL stopped talking and told my husband “he’s a disappointment and …..” and that’s how our night ended. FIL laughed when that happened and now she’s divorcing him.

I might also add: Yes MIL expected me or my husband to slap 5f and she used to hit my husband till he was 15.

So am I TA for not saying anything?

Update : I went over to MIL’S house and sat down with her to talk. Turns out she has been extremely stressed out because FIL cheated on her, lied to her parents and her parents went NC with her without letting her explain. I’m probably gonna ask her to get therapy and she’s again focusing on herself and hygiene 5f and MIL made up and MIL apologized to me, 5f and 14f. Our family is happy again."

ywefto_4555,ywefto,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"*OP deleted the post, I am not the original poster*

I (26F) have three best friends: Jake (27M), Nancy (27F) and Kara (26F). We have been a friend group since 9th grade, but I met them in different moments of my life: I met Kara at ballet class at 3, Jake in middle school at 11, and Nancy through Kara. We all love each other like siblings, if not more. After graduation the four of us all took different directions. Nancy studied in another city, Jake and I moved to two different states, Kara stayed in our state. We all stayed in contact and remained best friends, but we couldn’t see each other often. 

Three months ago, Kara called us back home for an emergency. When we reunited  Kara announced that she was getting married to Steve (30M), her boyfriend of 5 years. Now, Kara has always been the deadly combination between a hopeless romantic and someone that programs things extremely early, and she’s been programming her wedding since she was 15, pretty much like Monica Geller, so to the group it was spectacular news.

Kara is getting married December 2023. We’re all back home for two weeks, and this is when I discovered who Kara chose as maid of honor: Nancy, and I would’ve been one of her bridesmaids. This was a smack in the face to me.

Kara and I couldn’t be more different: she loves physical touch, I can’t stand it; she always had her life planned, I don’t know what I’ll do in an hour; she always wanted to get married and have kids, I can’t stand the idea of both marriage and motherhood; she’s Catholic, I’m an atheist. The list gos on and on, but this never made us any less close. We’ve always been there for each other, Kara is a treasure and we love each other, but as much as we do, I knew I wasn’t going to be her first best friend anymore when she met Nancy.

Kara and Nancy met at church when we had just started 8th grade. They were both Harry Potter fans, had the same color and phone model, were born one day apart and one year apart, had the same interests and many other stuff. Nancy immediately became Kara’s 1st best friend.

During our high school years Kara had become clingy and logorrheic at school, and two of three times it happened that I blew up in her face and said hurtful things I didn’t mean. I immediately apologized after those episodes. Nancy never was like that with Kara, in fact I’m 95% sure they never argued in almost 15 years of friendship. I admit I wasn’t the best friend to have around, but I had my own stuff on my mind, and I never really thought about how I behaved with Kara. I loved Kara dearly, but sometimes I needed breaks from her. She wouldn’t shut up about her dream job, dream man, dream wedding, future kids, future house etc. I just sat there, zoned out, while Nancy listened to all her rants and inserted herself and her future children in Kara’s day dreams.

After graduation we all moved far except for Kara, and Nancy was close enough to still visit on weekends so they got closer. Jake and I couldn’t. During that time I felt nostalgic of the days I spent with Kara never stopping from talking. I felt lonely, and I became clingy towards her during phone calls. I really missed her, and the fact she chose Nancy upset me. I had never realized how much Kara mattered to me.

Last week we were reunited to help Kara and Steve with wedding stuff, which is when Kara told me she chose Nancy as her MoH. I asked her why she didn’t choose me, and she said that I never got confirmation and I’m atheist, so I can’t be a maid of honor in the Catholic rite. 

I got silent and cold after that. It wasn’t until the evening that Kara confronted me about what was bothering me. I tried to say deny something was wrong, but she kept pushing, so I just exploded in front of the others too. I admitted that I was upset for not being chosen as MoH, and that I couldn’t believe she chose someone she knew for 15 years over someone she’s known for 23, the person aside her relatives that saw her grow up. Kara immediately defended herself and said that she didn’t want to burden me with wedding stuff she knows I dislike, and that making me maid of honor was impossible due to the Catholic rite and she could never ask me to take a sacrament if I didn’t have faith in. I spat back that if she cared about me she would’ve found a way, and that she shouldn’t make up excuses since her perfect wedding was already planned back when she was an obnoxious and stupid girl who couldn’t shut up to save her life, and Nancy being the MoH was the plan all along. I said many other hurtful things I don’t remember. It was only when I was done that I realized I had exploded like when I was a teen, just three times worse. I looked at Kara and she looked like she was about to cry. She excused herself and left. Silence fell. Nancy ran after her. I tried to go too but Steve stopped me and asked me to leave for the rest of the night.

Jake came back to our hotel room two hours later. He told me Nancy had stayed with Kara to comfort her, and that Steve was furious. Jake told me that I should’ve handled things differently and immediately talk to him or Nancy over how she felt instead of keeping everything inside and then exploding. He told me that although he validates my feelings, it’s not a good excuse to blow up in Kara’s face like that when she’s doing the best she can to organize the wedding on her own. He told me that he had the same reaction at the beginning because of the church’s restrictions over atheists, but he had resigned himself and was cool with being a groomsman as long as Kara was happy.

This morning I got a call from Steve, telling me that Kara is really upset and that it’s better if I spend today away from the wedding preparations and see what happens tomorrow.

I love Kara with my whole heart and I never wanted to be the person who hurt her, especially playing over her insecurities. I feel awful for blowing up at her, but at the same time I feel like nobody cares about my point of view on the matter and everyone wants to act good for Kara. I need to know, who’s the asshole here? What can I do?


EDIT:
There are some things I should clarify:
- we’re not Americans
- the majority of my country’s population is Catholic, so it’s hard to have an atheist MoH or BM in the Catholic rite
- since we were teens, Kara talked about how she wanted me, Nancy and Jake as MoHs and BM, and if it wasn’t possible having 3 (it’s always 2) either me or Jake would’ve been the other MoH or BM. We couldn’t be both MoH and BM because she and Nancy already promised to be each other’s MoH. I thought it was just a promise between teens and that they wouldn’t have kept it, which is why I was surprised.
- I don’t find her dreams stupid, but they’re not what I would do for myself. I admit, I called her stupid because she was insecure at school, me having straight As and her having problems with some subjects that I helped her with. I’m already beating myself up for saying it dw"

I (26F) have three best friends: Jake (27M), Nancy (27F) and Kara (26F). We have been a friend group since 9th grade, but I met them in different moments of my life: I met Kara at ballet class at 3, Jake in middle school at 11, and Nancy through Kara. We all love each other like siblings, if not more. After graduation the four of us all took different directions. Nancy studied in another city, Jake and I moved to two different states, Kara stayed in our state. We all stayed in contact and remained best friends, but we couldn’t see each other often. 

Three months ago, Kara called us back home for an emergency. When we reunited  Kara announced that she was getting married to Steve (30M), her boyfriend of 5 years. Now, Kara has always been the deadly combination between a hopeless romantic and someone that programs things extremely early, and she’s been programming her wedding since she was 15, pretty much like Monica Geller, so to the group it was spectacular news.

Kara is getting married December 2023. We’re all back home for two weeks, and this is when I discovered who Kara chose as maid of honor: Nancy, and I would’ve been one of her bridesmaids. This was a smack in the face to me.

Kara and I couldn’t be more different: she loves physical touch, I can’t stand it; she always had her life planned, I don’t know what I’ll do in an hour; she always wanted to get married and have kids, I can’t stand the idea of both marriage and motherhood; she’s Catholic, I’m an atheist. The list gos on and on, but this never made us any less close. We’ve always been there for each other, Kara is a treasure and we love each other, but as much as we do, I knew I wasn’t going to be her first best friend anymore when she met Nancy.

Kara and Nancy met at church when we had just started 8th grade. They were both Harry Potter fans, had the same color and phone model, were born one day apart and one year apart, had the same interests and many other stuff. Nancy immediately became Kara’s 1st best friend.

During our high school years Kara had become clingy and logorrheic at school, and two of three times it happened that I blew up in her face and said hurtful things I didn’t mean. I immediately apologized after those episodes. Nancy never was like that with Kara, in fact I’m 95% sure they never argued in almost 15 years of friendship. I admit I wasn’t the best friend to have around, but I had my own stuff on my mind, and I never really thought about how I behaved with Kara. I loved Kara dearly, but sometimes I needed breaks from her. She wouldn’t shut up about her dream job, dream man, dream wedding, future kids, future house etc. I just sat there, zoned out, while Nancy listened to all her rants and inserted herself and her future children in Kara’s day dreams.

After graduation we all moved far except for Kara, and Nancy was close enough to still visit on weekends so they got closer. Jake and I couldn’t. During that time I felt nostalgic of the days I spent with Kara never stopping from talking. I felt lonely, and I became clingy towards her during phone calls. I really missed her, and the fact she chose Nancy upset me. I had never realized how much Kara mattered to me.

yxaz3d_4575,yxaz3d,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"Background: I (f21) grew up in a horrible household. 19 years I lived there and it was hell. My only escape was watching movies with my sister (f25). The best part of watching these movies was looking at the others reaction during a plot twist, discussing the plot, and just the whole experience of not doing it alone. 

My bf (m21) and I have been together for 2 1/2 years. He doesn't like watching movies as he thinks they're too long. He grew up an outside kid so he didn't usually watch anything. He watches podcasts on YouTube and history videos which he does 24/7 I shit you not. Anyways I normally beg for him to watch movies with me only for him to then either get on his phone or fall asleep. Today he asked me to watch a film with him and said I can pick. I said I was sleepy and I have work tomorrow so maybe no but he insisted it was just 8pm.

 So I pick a film and we start watching it, midway through I notice hes asleep, I tell him we can watch it tomorrow it's fine but he says oh no I was just closing my eyes. He does this 3 more times and I keep saying please let's just watch it tomorrow and he keeps insisting no I'm interested in the movie I want to watch I was not sleeping I was closing my eyes. 

Finally I get really pissed off at him as it really hurts me. I snap. I yell at him for insisting on playing the movie even though he is falling Asleep and the fact that he keeps saying oh I wasn't sleeping I was closing my eyes. He then makes it seem like it's not a reason to yell or get angry because it's just a movie. I then get really angry and say I was never into what your business sells but I learned about it and then cared for it too, you can't even do that for me, if I said your business is stupid and not something to care about how would that make you feel. I even went so far to say if you can't care enough to watch one film with me then I don't have to care about your business everytime you talk to me about it. 

He got mad and said he needs to reevaluate our relationship because of my outburst and that what I did was very toxic. 

I see where I am toxic but I also feel like after 2 1/2 years of begging to try out my interest properly, Its reasonable to snap. He is a nice guy and he always takes care of me but I feel like my interests just aren't as important as his. Idk, AITA?

Edit: thank you for all the responses but I would like to clear a few things up. 

1) I never forced him to watch movies with me, I would ask at the start of the relationship and if he slept, I would be like oh okay that's fine, he's not interested. I only got mad because he kept insisting that he was watching when he was sleeping.

2) he just started the business recently, he has another job and the business has been more of a hobby. I would never insult his business, I just wanted him to see it from my perspective that's why I said ""if""."

I went to a room in one of their offices to handwrite some of their letters. Long story short they didn't like my letters because they felt as though they were too short and a little generic. I revised the letters but they still didn't like them. I won't lie-- my letters weren't anything special.

The person overseeing this writing letter process scolded me and told me something along the lines of, ""You're a college student so you should be more grateful and write better."" At this point, I started to get mad because, in my opinion, the threat of revoking scholarships and getting me to do all of this stuff is basically just shilling students to put a good image on the college so they can continue to receive money from donors.

So the situation is the following: My husband and I are expecting our first baby. We announced the pregnancy in summer and his family was exited though not as thrilled as when his sister had announced her own baby the year before. Which I can totally understand as that was the first grandchild and all. 

The first thing that my SIL said was: “Oh that’s so great! You can use all our stuff!” Well here is where the problem starts. She had a baby girl and bought everything in pink or with glitter which I absolutely loathe (no offense, I just prefer neutral Colors). I know that my husbands family paid for many things like the car seat or the stroller. I do not expect any gifts or money, sure, I would be happy to receive some, but I don’t count on them.

So we do not know the fender yet as we want It to be a surprise. That is another reason why I am all for neutral colors. Yesterday we went to see my Inlaws and told them about a shop we wanted to have a look at, which is specialised in Baby safety. My MIL was totally confused and asked what we were planning on buying and when I answered that we would like to consult them on car seats she was furious. Why we were even thinking about that as my SIL had already offered hers, that it would be ridiculous to buy new stuff as we could receive the used things. Don’t get me wrong, I am all in for Secondhand and everything! 

- But my niece weighs about 33 lbs and the seat they are still using is only meant until about 28/29 lbs I think. 
- Apart from that I know the seat fell down the stairs once and maybe I am overreacting but I just don’t feel safe using it for my own baby.
- It is pink (which would be okay for a car seat, I guess.)
- It does not fit the stroller be have settled on (the two brands are not compatible or adaptable

And the last reason - maybe even the most important: I know my SIL - we would have to be thankful like forever and I don’t even know if the seat is meant to be “free” or if she’d like to sell it to us. Last week she was going through the baby’s dresser and “picked out” clothing the will like to have for her own baby (they are planning the second one). And maybe it’s the Hormons, but this just didn’t seem right to me - I barely want anything from her, I could totally live completely without her stuff, but she is kind of demanding our things. There are two differences: Her things were almost completely gifts by my in-laws and her husbands parents, we bought everything ourselves. While she owns cheap clothing (not referring to the price but the quality), I focused on quality and cotton, silk and other materials which I myself can wear (I have suffered from neurodermatitis since I was a baby and wanted to prepare if my child inherits it from me). For me it doesn’t seem a fair trade and I would like to keep our Babys’ wardrobes and everything separate. 

AITA? And how could I handle this?"

yy1hjx_4617,yy1hjx,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"AITA for refusing to get a job?

Now first off, I'm on disability. Which doesn't cover my full monthly expenses, and I have to work as much as I can to supplement the difference anyways. 

I(28m) have 2 ""roommates"", my 45year old mother and 25 year old brother. 
My mother never pays anything, my brother often pays for his truck or his alcohol, and conveniently doesn't have rent. 
All the bills, rent, electricity, car loan, car insurance, and even my mother's and kid sister's cellphones I pay for. 
(Actually I pay the majority of them but not the full amount cuz i cant afford it, so every 4 to 6 months one or all of them are overdue and sometimes my mom or bro will pay for some bills at one of these times, tho even then I'm often required to go to work to make the difference, or they'll demand I pay them back for them ""paying my bills"").
I take odd jobs most the year, and in the summer I go fire fighting. (If I'm lucky I'll make 10G that'll ill then have to divide over the fall-spring time to supplement what my disability can't afford).
So I do work. 
But besides all that, I also have to drive my mom and sister around 5/6 days a week cuz my mom doesn't have a license and chose to homeschool my sister. (Various classes/moms poor scheduling means we leave the house around 9-10am, back home around 8-11pm)
So if I do get work anytime of the year besides Summer, that means I only have 1, maybe 2 days a week I can work, and they'd be my only off days. 
I don't get to use my car for anything I want. And even if I could, I'm lucky to have $5-$20 left at the end of the month to do anything with. 
The lack of any self agency and any financial independence means I'm lucky if I see a friend every 3-4 months. So, I'm basically paying for their car and insurance even tho it's technically in my name.
My brother simply doesn't respond if asked to do anything. He barely pays his half the rent about 70% of the time.
And mom will scream up and down that she provided for us for years it's our turn to provide for her, if she's ever called out. Sometimes she sounds reasonable when she says things like ""you pay rent and bills, I pay food and gas. It's like $800 for food every month and $1000 in gas"".
But then I remember that it's literally ALL her gas. I don't get to use it. And it's 80% her and her daughters food, ""you boys have to fend for yourselves. You're supposed to be men!""
So it doesn't actually balance out at all. 

I had a hard enough time with just my brother as roommate, but she and our sister came for a visit 8 years ago, then never left. About a year of her bullying me later, and I'm paying for her phone and signing for her car. (Which apparently, was actually me begging her to help me get my first car, and not her using her son cuz she had shitty credit)

But now my landlord is texting me asking me to be more prompt with rent from now on, and also asking for the rest of this month's upfront. 
So I tell both of them what the landlord said, and they both tell me to go get a job. And I refused. I'm done paying for everything, and being told I'm lazy or immature because I want to split things evenly 3 ways. Why would I get a shitty min-wager, on my only 2 free days a week, if they won't even have a open conversation about expenses?
They always have money for whatever they want, new clothes, fix his truck, buy a random camera/item that never gets used or a new TV when the old TV was also a nice flat-screen and didn't need replaced. Etc.
Meanwhile, I'm lucky to have $5 at the end of the month. Super lucky if it's $20. 

I have a feeling, that if i get working, it wouldn't actually equate to anything substantial, it would only serve them to have the extra 4-500$ before I'm ""bugging them for money"".

If I was on my own, or if they acted differently, I wouldn't even be posting here. 
So AITA?"

yy377h_4625,yy377h,top-comment,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1," I know that the title looks wrong but hear me out. I'm writing this on a burner account because I don't want close friends or family to see this. Anyways, Me, 26 F, my husband 28 M that we'll call T, have been together for 10 years. We broke up a few times through out of our relationship because he was cheating. Yes, I know I went back (which was dumb.) Anyways It all started before our wedding, he had asked me if he could have strippers at his bachelor party. I initially declined because I feel weird about that fact that my soon to be husband was going to see half naked woman the night before our wedding. He ended up getting super mad and started throwing things around the house, he stormed out and ended up coming home around 5 am the next day. In the morning he asked again, I was too scared he would react the same way, so I agreed. I had never seen or felt unsafe around him until that moment. I feel very nervous posting this because I know I will get hate for not leaving, but I was holding on to the boy he was before that moment. The sweet, caring, funny boy I wanted to marry. After his bachelor party, two strippers came home with him. I didn't know how to react, I felt very mad and hurt at the same time. He told me we're all going to have some fun; He was clearly drunk. The strippers brought him to the couch and pulled me into another room and told me he was acting very sexual the whole night. We ended up talking for a while and I even cried to them about how off he was being. They were angels, super sweet. I told them I didn't want to do anything with them, they understood %100. I paid them for their time anyways because I felt bad. I brought my husband up to our room and didn't say one word to him. He didn't even ask me how I was (which is very off because that's usually the first thing he says to me when greeting me, drunk or not.) I've seen him drunk many times, but I've never seen anything like this. He kept going on about how beautiful the girls there were. How their bodies were perfect, how they smelt, and all the things he wanted to them. I left the room feeling sick. I cried for hours and cuddled with my cats, I don't know if I was being dramatic or not still. Fast forward a few months, I had gotten pregnant after a while of us trying But I was labeled ""high risk"". I ended up having a miscarriage at 4 months. I know what you're thinking, my husband probably got very mad. But he didn't, he was very loving and gave me A LOT of attention. I felt as if we were finally okay again. We started going to marriage therapy and were able to talk about the bachelor drama, we both cried a lot. He admitted to feeling VERY depressed and drained with life, that scared me because when we first met, he had very suicidal thoughts. He told me everything in life lost its spark, including our relationship. I didn't know what to say at the time, but he told me after the miscarriage he felt closer to me, his words: ""I was glad we were both sad, we were able to heal each other, and I didn't have to struggle alone."" That concerned me, he felt closer to me because we were both sad? My husband was never a gloomy person up until the whole bachelor thing. I don't know what has changed in him, or what I did. We ended up moving past that, Now, The whole title. I was able to get pregnant again!! I'm 8 months this week. My husband was never a big cat person, he didn't hate them nor was he allergic he just wasn't a big fan. Me on the other hand, I love my babies they're like my children lol. Anyways I've been cleaning their little box my whole pregnancy (which I shouldn't have but I didn't know.) But I'd had read this article about how bad it is for pregnant woman. Now this is where it begins, my husband was great all week up until this moment. I kindly asked my husband if he could change the litter and explained how bad it was for our baby and I's health. He looked at me dead in the eyes and said, ""Your dumb cats, you deal with it."" I was dumbfounded, I can barely bend down with my belly. I just stared at him with a confused face, he told me to ""fuck off, or go change the litter."" I was getting very frustrated because we don't curse at each other. I told him ""Please don't talk to me like that, and all I'm asking for is for you to change the litter it takes 5 seconds."" He slammed his feet to the floor and stood up. He was Cleary just as mad as me now. He started listed the things he does for me, he said ""I work all day, I gave up my office for that baby, I threw away my 20's to be with you."" I was pissed, I don't know if it was my pregnancy hormones, but I snapped. I just started yelling about everything he's put me through. I took it too far by mentioning his mental health, but it had to be said. I told him ""Just because your sad and fucked up doesn't give you the right to treat me like shit."" He started crying and hyperventilating. I told him that I was over his shit and that he either needs to fix his problems or divorce me because I refuse to raise our baby around this. He walked over to me and looked in my eyes. When I tell you my heart stopped. it did, I've never seen this look in his eyes, full of hate and rage. He started yelling about our marriage and then grabbed his jacket. I told him if you leave now don't bother coming back. I should've never said that he just needed air, but I didn't care at the time. He threw a cup and left. I haven't talk to him for 24 hours, I'm seriously considering filing for divorce. I would've taken it back then but now they're kids involved, and I refuse to raise my baby like this. So, am I overacting, or should I forgive him, or do I divorce my best friend of 10 years and raise my baby alone?"

I absolutely love video games, so when i got some money I bought a pretty decent computer. I bought a 20 dollar mouse and keyboard combo from amazon. When they started to wear out I upgraded to what I have now. So when my little cousin went into my room and refused to come out I got his mother and she said ""oh let him be he is just being silly"". After a few minutes of him still refusing to get out of my room he took my keyboard and threw it out of my window. It shattered on the pavement (second floor btw). I tried to keep my cool and talk to his mom once more to get some money so i could get another one. After I semi scolded my cousin he started crying.

yyt1aj_4637,yyt1aj,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Some background. My child, 5f, has just started Kindergarten this year. This is her very first school experience. Now we have always called her by her middle name, as is quite common in my family. I explained this both her school paperwork and face to face with her teacher at the beginning of the school year, and she seemed to understand. Recently my child has been begging me not to make her go to school, and she comes home in tears. I found out this is because her teacher has refused to call her by anything other than her first name, and is punishing her when she doesn’t respond to it. I reached out and explained again, that we have never called her by her first name. A few days later I get a call that my child has struck a classmate for repeatedly calling her by her first name and taunting her with it. I absolutely do not condone hitting, but at the same time, I understand her frustration. I explained again that this is obviously upsetting my child and causing issues, and thought that would finally be the end of it, until yesterday. I received a note on her report card that she is refusing to accept being called by her first name, and asking that we at home explain to her that she needs to be called by that name. I reached out to the teacher again this morning, and this time was told that they “have to go by her first name”. Now, keep in mind, I have never had this issue before, as my two older children’s teacher have all been perfectly fine calling them by their middle names. I am frustrated and upset that my kindergartner is so frustrated and upset. She was so excited to start school and now she hates it. My husband thinks I should call the dean of the school and see if anything can be done, and file a complaint about the teacher. I really do not know what else to do at this point, but wibtah for calling the dean?"

yzgj45_4662,yzgj45,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"So yesterday my boyfriend(m21) and I(F20) had a little party at my house. I didn't drink much because I was not in the mood but my boyfriend was pretty drunk pretty early. He always ""walked"" past me,not really walking straight and kind of grabbed me or walked into me ruffly. I know his intentions weren't bad cause he always smiled and was happy but I kind of felt uncomfortable with how hard he grabbed or hugged me and wouldn't let me go(yes I told him I don't like it). So for the rest of the evening I just ignored him and had fun with my friends and so did he. I went to him multiple times during the party and told him I don't want him to sleep next to me tonight and he told me he understood.

A little background info: we had lots of conversations about how I'm a little scared of people I love and trust getting drunk because it's hard for me to talk to them and I get scared pretty quick. Up until now he always understood that. I also wanna clarify that I don't have a problem with him drinking, he can do as he like,I just don't need that around me. I also get panic attacks when I feel like the person I'm talking to doesn't listen or doesn't understand what I'm trying to say(childhood trauma,working on it,he knows that)

Anyways so when it was time to go to bed it put his stuff out of my room and next to the sofa. He then came into my room and held onto me,begging me to tell him what's wrong and why he can't sleep next to me. I told him I already explained it to him and need my privacy as I'm feeling a little ""panicky"" already. He cuddled onto me tighter,talking to me,slurring all the words while I tried to tell him that we will talk about it when he's sober. (I know it's hard to argue with a drunk person so I just wanted to wait,i also know at what alcohol level he remembers the talk the next day and he was far away from that)

After a while got up to go to the toilet but he wouldn't let me go in the bathroom alone. He shoved me into the bathroom demanding an answer to what is wrong with me but I didn't tell him. I tried to push him out of the bathroom,screaming that I'm scared of him and to leave me alone, but he held my wrists so just shoved him out and slapped him on the back. Then held the door close. At that point I was already having a full on panic attack. I got to the floor and started crying. He came back in trying to hold me tight again when my roommate heard me cry and managed to get him out of the room. I just sat there crying for a while. (i was also a little tipsy,mind that so I may have overreacted) In the end I let him sleep in my bed next to me because I was tired and sick of arguing.

When we woke up this morning he apologized after I told him what happend. He said that he was scared that I would do something to myself(i have a history of that) and that's why he wouldn't leave me alone when I told him to. He only remembers like 20% of the night. I told him i need some time to think about this apology and how to go an with that.

I didn't drink much because I was not in the mood but my boyfriend was pretty drunk pretty early. He always ""walked"" past me,not really walking straight and kind of grabbed me or walked into me ruffly. I know his intentions weren't bad cause he always smiled and was happy but I kind of felt uncomfortable with how hard he grabbed or hugged me and wouldn't let me go(yes I told him I don't like it). So for the rest of the evening I just ignored him and had fun with my friends and so did he. I went to him multiple times during the party and told him I don't want him to sleep next to me tonight and he told me he understood.

A little background info: we had lots of conversations about how I'm a little scared of people I love and trust getting drunk because it's hard for me to talk to them and I get scared pretty quick. Up until now he always understood that. I also wanna clarify that I don't have a problem with him drinking, he can do as he like,I just don't need that around me. I also get panic attacks when I feel like the person I'm talking to doesn't listen or doesn't understand what I'm trying to say(childhood trauma,working on it,he knows that)

Anyways so when it was time to go to bed it put his stuff out of my room and next to the sofa. He then came into my room and held onto me,begging me to tell him what's wrong and why he can't sleep next to me. I told him I already explained it to him and need my privacy as I'm feeling a little ""panicky"" already. He cuddled onto me tighter,talking to me,slurring all the words while I tried to tell him that we will talk about it when he's sober. (I know it's hard to argue with a drunk person so I just wanted to wait,i also know at what alcohol level he remembers the talk the next day and he was far away from that)

After a while got up to go to the toilet but he wouldn't let me go in the bathroom alone. He shoved me into the bathroom demanding an answer to what is wrong with me but I didn't tell him. I tried to push him out of the bathroom,screaming that I'm scared of him and to leave me alone, but he held my wrists so just shoved him out and slapped him on the back. Then held the door close. At that point I was already having a full on panic attack. I got to the floor and started crying. He came back in trying to hold me tight again when my roommate heard me cry and managed to get him out of the room. I just sat there crying for a while. (i was also a little tipsy,mind that so I may have overreacted) In the end I let him sleep in my bed next to me because I was tired and sick of arguing.

When we woke up this morning he apologized after I told him what happend. He said that he was scared that I would do something to myself(i have a history of that) and that's why he wouldn't leave me alone when I told him to. He only remembers like 20% of the night. I told him i need some time to think about this apology and how to go an with that.

I think I might be the asshole for not telling him what was wrong and for slapping him and for wanting him to sleep elsewhere when all he did was beeing to drunk. AITA?."

I have 3 brothers and a sister. They weren’t interested in anything other than what they could get. They weren’t interested after they took what they wanted (Including her money, before she had even passed). 

While cleaning out her house, I found a drawing she had done (drawing was something she did for years).

I really want it. It’s good and would be something to remember her by but now I’m thinking about what he said and wanted to ask if it would be wrong? 

My partner said I should do what I want and if getting it would make me happy then I should but I can’t shake off what my brother said. He’s fully against it and has told other family members about it and they agree with him.

I started noticing a couple of weeks ago that he was being weird about his phone. I mentioned it and that turned into a fight where I don't trust him (I have reason not to, but that's a different story). Then on Wednesday I saw him message someone with a pink heart in their name. Soon as I asked who was that, he quickly turned is phone off and said he has no idea what I was on about. And then started fussing over the kids. I felt strange about it, so that night I brought it up once the kids went to bed. He gaslit the crap out of me saying I am seeing things and it was just a twitter notification and then tried to show me something to pass off. Was defs NOT that. But then he said he would pack his stuff and leave, I freaked and pretty much just let it go (I know, red flags and I just let it go. I was trying to think of my kids). Anyways, I went to drop my stepson home to his mum this afternoon (exs ex-wife, amazing woman), and she said she had something to tell me. He has a girlfriend. My heart just dropped. I said goodbye, raced home and when I got there I picked up his phone and told him to follow me. Long story short, it all came out. His ex from years ago just came back into town, and he ran into her. He has always loved her, and she was the one who got away. Turns out they have been seeing each other for 4 weeks (that's what he said, but I think it'a longer). She is married with kids, and her husband knows. Aparently my nagging him to be a better parent to his kids (there is 6, 2 have nothing to do with him) made him unhappy in our relationship. He loves me, but loves her more. So he said it's over and packed his stuff. While he did that I got my phone and rang my parents. We organised for them to come get me and the kids and start packing stuff up and we will move in with them (I can't afford rent on my own). 

So hears where I might be the asshole. I blocked me ex on FB, but still had his family. I wrote a status saying that 10 years of my life was wasted cus he cheated. His mum and SIL got on the post calling me names and saying it didn't need to be on FB. I agree, but I was also angry and pissed. And then his mother said I need to grow up and stop looking for attention, and to tell both sides. I blew up. Both sides?? I didn't cheat. I was always home with the kids, doing everything. It turned into a big thing where his ex-wife and daughter (who wants nothing to do with him) came to my defense and said its a pattern for him. I blocked them, cus they haven't seen my kids more then twice in 2 years. So, AITA?

z095pe_4704,z095pe,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0," My (52F) daughter (24F) has always been a sloppy dresser. She has never dressed up well when we go to nice restaurants or family parties, and only wore dresses or nicer coats instead of her usual outfit consisting of hoodies and jeans when we asked her several times. I have always found her constant failure to dress nicely for us selfish, yet she refuses to see it as we do and does not see the issue with her behavior.

When she was 17, we had gone to a restaurant for my birthday and she had worn jeans, a T-shirt and a long jacket that she had only worn when she was asked to. The next day, she dressed up in a skirt and sweater and overall, a much nicer and more appropriate outfit to see her boyfriend without being asked to, and I was upset that she'd extend this courtesy to her boyfriend but not me. I had told her off for it before she left but she was confused and did not see how selfish she had been.

Last week, she married the same boy and I had decided to let her see what it felt like to be seen as less of a priority on an occasion that is important to her, so without telling her I arrived at her wedding in jeans and a blouse instead of my prepared outfit. However, at the wedding I was shocked to see that my daughter did not seem to take issue with this. She did not comment on my attire once throughout the day and has still been in the same level of contact with me yet has not mentioned or seemed to have cared. My husband, however, is angry at me, as he had tried to discourage me from swapping my outfit to a casual one and now is telling me that I had embarrassed him with my attire and that as mother of the bride I should have been more considerate of how it made him look to stand next to me.

z0hbsh_4712,z0hbsh,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I know the title makes me sound bad but hear me out.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a few months. We are both in our twenties, and due to a handful of situations we live together. 

The past few days, he has been sick. I’ve been trying to take care of him as I can, but there’s not much I feel I can do. Here’s where the issues start.

My boyfriend (we’ll call him Dave), is a disgusting person when he is sick. Dave has been blowing snot all over, including just putting a finger over a nostril and blowing straight onto the floor. He also spits on the floor, and has been coughing non stop.

I tried to bring up the snot thing with him, but he just said it was “better than wasting a few rolls of toilet paper”. So whatever I tried to just look past it. The spit I can deal with, although I find it gross as well. 

What is really driving me crazy is the coughing. I know Dave can’t control it, and I’m trying so hard to be patient, but he keeps coughing directly on me, and I can’t fucking stand it. I’ve tried to ask him to stop but he just says “I can’t control it”. The real issue I have is he doesn’t even attempt to roll over. Like, I understand accidents happen, but even after he coughs once or twice he doesn’t attempt to cover it or move away from me unless he’s having a coughing fit and needs to sit up. 

Last night, I was woken several times to being coughed at right in my face. I just started getting annoyed and sitting up so I wouldn’t disturb him, because I know he’s trying to get some sleep too. But today when I did that he made a comment about me being a bitch. I tried to explain why I was bothered, but Dave just got mad and kept saying he couldn’t control it, and he’s getting pissed with the “dirty looks and whining about it”. 

We haven’t been together long, and honestly if he is going to be this way every time he gets sick, I don’t want it. He has several medical conditions which can cause him to get sick way more often than most people, due to a weaker immune system. We travel a lot, so we are in a pretty small space, which basically is just a bed as far as places to relax and/or sleep. 

I don’t know if I am just low on sleep, or if my feelings are valid. So Reddit, am I the asshole?


Edit: We fought about it a bit. He says he’s only been spitting and snorting onto trash on the floor. He also says he is coughing “in dead sleep” so how could he stop it. However, since I told him it was disgusting and really bothering me, I haven’t been coughed on, so I don’t feel like his initial excuse was valid."

It was about 2 hours after my parents left when I heard her coughing persistently upstairs. I asked if she was alright, and she said yes. That was the end of that. About ten minutes later I heard her coughing again, I asked if she was alright. I didn't get a reply. I rushed upstairs and she was sat on her bed, looking at me. I sighed and looked at her ""answer next time, I thought you where choking."" She nodded and apologise with a quick ""sorry."" So I replied ""no need to apologise."" She smiled and I smiled back ""are you alright then?"" I asked she shrugged her shoulders and I asked what was wrong ""well, I've got a headache and a bad belly."" I instantly thought of covid, as my dad had it not long ago, and asked her if she had a sore throat. She said yes. Those where the only symptoms but I thought I might aswell check. I messaged my mum asking if we had tests but she didn't reply so I went looking. I found some and when she hadn't messaged back or even read the message I did the test. I did it in fun way as to not make her cry (I made it into a game, said she could punch my leg if it hurt. Everything I could think of.) She did the test, only once did she complain about the feeling, and that was that. I fixed the test up and she came back negative and that was the end of it. That's until my mum came home and my niece told her. My mum had yelled for me and I stood at the top of the stairs asking her what's wrong. She had a go at me, saying that it could traumatise a child and that she (my niece) only had a cold. But the thing is, my parents didn't tell me! They knew before hand and didn't tell me, the babysitter, that the child I was babysitting was ill!

(I should also not that I take health and social care in college and I have learnt how to give anyone and everyone a covid test.)

Now I know I could've messaged my mum again to see if she'd reply, I don't know why I didn't. And my niece didn't mind the test! She was laughing by the end of it! But I don't know, I'm conflicted. AITA?

Edits: yes, I should've tried to communicate with my mum more, but I didn't. I don't know why. And for some of you saying to ask her (nieces) parents, they aren't fit to care and she has been living with us for years. And for some people saying that the test could've waited, it couldn't. They where going to a party with multiple friends with terminally sick children, so a covid test that came back positive would have them come back early, lowering the risk those children getting infected.

Edit 2: since people keep bringing it up, no I don't like my niece. No I DO NOT want to hurt my niece. When I made that post I was EXTREMELY upset by something she had done and said. I regret what I said but I stand by the fact that I dislike her. But do NOT EVER think I would EVER hurt a child over something so petty. I don't care what you think of me and nor do I care of any pre-conseved notions you have of me. But don't ever insinuate I'd ever hurt my niece. As much as I dislike her, she's family. And family comes first. The post the comments are talking about has been deleted. As I've stated in another comment, I regret what I wrote. I didn't really give it any second thought until now. I will probably write another post like it, but write it when I'm calm and not biased to say anything harmful."

It was about 2 hours after my parents left when I heard her coughing persistently upstairs. I asked if she was alright, and she said yes. That was the end of that. About ten minutes later I heard her coughing again, I asked if she was alright. I didn't get a reply. I rushed upstairs and she was sat on her bed, looking at me. I sighed and looked at her ""answer next time, I thought you where choking."" She nodded and apologise with a quick ""sorry."" So I replied ""no need to apologise."" She smiled and I smiled back ""are you alright then?"" I asked she shrugged her shoulders and I asked what was wrong ""well, I've got a headache and a bad belly."" I instantly thought of covid, as my dad had it not long ago, and asked her if she had a sore throat. She said yes. Those where the only symptoms but I thought I might aswell check. I messaged my mum asking if we had tests but she didn't reply so I went looking. I found some and when she hadn't messaged back or even read the message I did the test.

Once I was at work I saw that so many of you replied. I have read so many of what you guys have told me. I have officially broken up with him. Of course it hurts a little bit but after reading what you guys have said I know it’s better for me. As for my dads situation I’m happy for him that’s he’s talking to someone else now. I didn’t mean to say that I didn’t want him to be happy I just wasn’t ready to be presented to someone else. But my dad called me and understood how he was feeling and told me that he will show me another person once I’m ready! But thank you everyone so much. I didn’t expect to get so many replies but thank you so much! I’m going to be focusing on my college life more like I should have been doing this whole time! :) *****I (19f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been together for almost a year now. Everything was great at the beginning. But things have changed. I realized that we are different people and that we would need to work on specific things so that way we would work out.
Everytime I tell him or try to talk to him about it he always tells me ""you're such an over thinker"" and then he literally puts me on mute so he doesn't have to hear my messages even though I'm trying to work it out. Everytime he does that it hurts. But for the story context. My dads girlfriend recently passed away because of breast cancer. She meant the whole world to me because she treated me like her kid and treated me better than my own mom has. She passed away almost 2 months ago. So last week I took my dad out to eat and we started talking. He told me that he has been talking to someone new and that I should start getting ready to meet her. I didn't tell him anything because I didn't want to make him upset. I was upset because l'm still not over the death of his girlfriend that felt like my mom for so many years and he moved on so fast like his girlfriend didn't exist at all. So I told my boyfriend about it. I asked him if I had the right to be a little upset because he moved on so quick. He told me no. And I asked him why not? And he told me that at least he was moving on. He does have a point with what he said but it hasn't even been 2 whole months since she passed away.
So l asked him ""so let's say we were married for so many years and I pass away, you're telling me you would already be with someone new after a whole month?"" He told me ""yeah I would because it's a waste of time to mourn, I would y be with someone new. Men are just different from women."" I was shocked. He just called mourning a waste of time. So I asked him ""are you serious or are you joking?"" And he told me he was 100% serious. I got so hurt. He broke my heart a bit by saying that. He has said so many things like that to me to the point that I have been losing feelings for him because he just keeps hurting me by saying hurtful things and he doesn't care. And yesterday night, my grandpa came to the United States finally after so many years of waiting for his visa to be approved. All of our family has been so excited for him to come back because it's been over 20 years of him not being able to see his kids. I told my boyfriend about it for the last few weeks because he knows how much my grandpa means to me. So I bought balloons and made my grandpa a poster so he could feel so welcome. I showed it to my boyfriend and he told me "" you're so extra for nothing"" that hurt me. He called me extra for wanting to make my grandpa feel so welcomed. I don't know what to do, he is so cold hearted and I don't know if l'm the asshole for losing feelings. I still have love for him which is why I have been dealing with it but I don't know if I can deal with it anymore. I wanted to make it work. AITA?"

z10s11_4739,z10s11,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"To start off, Christmas has always been a bad time of year for me (19f). My grandmother is very judgemental if things don’t fit into her “perfect picture” and I feel like I have to preform anytime I’m around my family. I have recently moved into my own house with my 2yr old son Elliot after  living with my foster carers for 3 years. They have been there everyday since Elliot was born and are honorary grandparents. I speak to them everyday and they’re the first I call when I forget how to cook sausages lol. 

My family are pressuring me to spend Christmas with them but things always go wrong and I’m always the one that walks away crying. However when Christmas came around at my foster placement, there were no issues. Everyone was happy. Everyone was relaxed. Whereas things are always tense with my family. Everything has to be perfect. Everyone has to act perfect. And more often than not, I fall out with my sister (10f) and my mother always defends her. Favourite child stuff. I just want a peaceful Christmas, that’s all I want. 

When I told my mother I wanted to spend Christmas with my foster carers she immediately turned cold as she usually is and started guilt tripping me about how the family haven’t spent a single Christmas with Elliot yet. My mother has never liked how Elliot is closer to my foster carers than he is to her and I understand that but I don’t want to take that relationship between Elliot and my foster carers away. 

I talked to my aunt (mothers sister) about this and she told me not to stress about it, spend Christmas with whoever makes you happy. She understands how exhausting and mentally draining family events are. However I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong for choosing to spend Christmas with “people who got paid to look after me” (grandmothers words) instead of my actual family. 
So AITA?

[A little backstory and some more context]
I was placed in foster care at 12 after my abusive dad died. I was grieving for losing a dad but also relieved I was safe. My mother never stepped in to protect me. Grandmother turned a blind eye. I started acting out in my grief, running away, skipping school and having arguments with my mum. She wouldn’t send me to therapy and she couldn’t handle my outbursts so she put me in foster care. 

I got pregnant at 16 so I was moved to my AMAZING foster carers who could better facilitate a mother and child so me and Elliot could stay together. They have continued to support me even after having new placements in and I’ve been gone for 6 months. They’ve bought half the furniture for my house for me with no expectation to being paid back and they’ve always taken Elliot for the odd weekend whenever I’ve gotten a bit overwhelmed or needed a break. 

My Aunt has always been painted as the black sheep and as overdramatic as she has POTS and struggles to get out of bed a lot of days so she’s been very understanding of this and she actually acknowledges and talks to me about how traumatic my childhood was instead of sweeping it under the rug like everyone else in the family."

To  offer some context, my wife and I have been happily married for close  to 8 years. While not perfect by any means, I think we're fairly  reasonable and well-adjusted people who try our best to consider  people's feelings and simply ask for the same in return.

Our  relationship with my wife's parents has always been stretched tight as a  drum, especially when it comes to anything holiday-related. While I  love them for my wife's sake, they don't do change, they don't  communicate thoughts or feelings, and if you deviate from the script of  family theater you get emotionally abusive retribution. Lots of  power/control stuff. This makes us second guess about everything we say  and do.

How bad is it? A couple  years ago we were invited for Thanksgiving brunch. We were told to show  up ""around 11"". We texted them when we left and they know it's a 40 min  trip. When we arrived at 11:15, the entire family had already eaten,  cleaned up, and was chilling in the living room. They basically ate  immediately after we texted them we were on the way. Not so much as a  word and we ate alone at the table. My wife was deeply hurt, and I felt  very disrespected. We are convinced this was our ""punishment"" for them  getting the lunch slot that year, which they previously griped about.  This is the type of stuff...

So  fast forward to last night. My wife and I talked it over and reluctantly  said we'd make a go of Thanksgiving if her parents could meet us  halfway with covid precautions (my wife is a hospital nurse and I have a  high risk condition). We know we're a minority with our ongoing masking  precautions, especially in the company of her strongly opinionated  parents, but it's how we have decided to navigate our own health at the  present time and we don't push it on others. They are aware of this. We  said we'd love to get together and asked if they'd be willing to at-home  swab the morning of so we could share a meal together. If not, we'd  love to see them another time when masking was more feasible for the  venue. I was even prepared to buy and drop off the tests if they were  amicable.

The immediate response  was literally ""we're not doing any red tape to get together with you"",  and they reiterated the when/where. My wife burst into tears because her  family wasn't willing to blow their nose on a stick for 3 seconds in  order to see her over the holidays this year. This struck my last nerve  and my instinct now is to protect my wife from further harm.

Like  I said, covid brings out strong opinions in people so I want to be fair  and own a faux pas if it's mine. Before we make some tough decisions  about ongoing contact with her parents, I have to ask, AITAH here for  making this request or is this just another petty move by her parents?

&amp;#x200B;

*Update: After we didn't respond (breathing and contemplating a firm but kind response), wife got a voicemail with a message essentially stating ""Love you and we are healthy. You can come alone if you want"" with a note on time. They have made their position clear, which is their right of course so no hate, but it does make our decision for us. I can walk away at peace, but regretful on that. However, the comment about coming alone, as if I am the heavy baggage, is not a singular event.  I call BS on that as throwing a grenade my way.*

Sam works mornings and recently has started training for night shifts. Idk if she was told to but Becky has been training Sam at her station and that’s going as well as you expect a girl and her bf to work together. Constantly talking or on their phones and ignoring the busy kitchen around them which includes some inappropriate touching (a** slaps and such) Becky also never finishes her shift, claiming to need to get her children or other family emergencies. She also uses her vape pen in the shop and I’ve told her repeatedly not to, instead she goes to the office/bathroom or waits till nobody is looking but you can distinctly smell the vape even if you don’t see her use it. 

To the password. It’s needed to authorize customer credit, coupons, and other things. I was unaware she had a password until one busy night she made a mistake with someone’s coupon and I needed to help her. That in itself wouldn’t be a big deal except it keeps happening. Becky also uses her password to give herself a managers discount on food instead of using the employee discount. The managers discount let’s you choose a discount amount and the employee discount is 20%. 

There are also tips from pick-up orders at the end of the night. I’ve told everyone to just ask before they leave and I will count and divide the tips, however most of them leave without asking. The other night, before Becky left she counted the tips and I happened to see the total while I was wiping the counters and grabbing dishes to be washed. Becky leaves and I continue cleaning, but when I go to replace the dishes at the counter I noticed all of the tip slips had been stabbed on the ticket holder. I usually staple them to the register slip to prove the correct amount was taken and put the stapled slips in the drawer so I open the register to do so and I grab my half of the tip money out of the jar. Becky has shorted my half of the tips by 7$. 

I’m not hurting for money, 7$ isn’t going to make me go hungry, but it’s a pretty shi**y thing to do to someone. And it’s the last straw in the pile of complaints I have about her. I plan to confront my boss about Becky because resolving any of these issues with just the two of us is going to cause some tension as she doesn’t seem to take anything I say seriously even though during my shifts I am the only manager. 

But basically, she’s stealing from the business, causing system errors which I then have to correct and now shorting me on tips; all with her password privileges. AITA if I ask my boss to take her password away?"

She also uses her vape pen in the shop and I’ve told her repeatedly not to, instead she goes to the office/bathroom or waits till nobody is looking but you can distinctly smell the vape even if you don’t see her use it. 

To the password. It’s needed to authorize customer credit, coupons, and other things. I was unaware she had a password until one busy night she made a mistake with someone’s coupon and I needed to help her. That in itself wouldn’t be a big deal except it keeps happening. Becky also uses her password to give herself a managers discount on food instead of using the employee discount. The managers discount let’s you choose a discount amount and the employee discount is 20%. 

There are also tips from pick-up orders at the end of the night. I’ve told everyone to just ask before they leave and I will count and divide the tips, however most of them leave without asking. The other night, before Becky left she counted the tips and I happened to see the total while I was wiping the counters and grabbing dishes to be washed. Becky leaves and I continue cleaning, but when I go to replace the dishes at the counter I noticed all of the tip slips had been stabbed on the ticket holder. I usually staple them to the register slip to prove the correct amount was taken and put the stapled slips in the drawer so I open the register to do so and I grab my half of the tip money out of the jar. Becky has shorted my half of the tips by 7$. 

I’m not hurting for money, 7$ isn’t going to make me go hungry, but it’s a pretty shi**y thing to do to someone. And it’s the last straw in the pile of complaints I have about her. I plan to confront my boss about Becky because resolving any of these issues with just the two of us is going to cause some tension as she doesn’t seem to take anything I say seriously even though during my shifts I am the only manager. 

But basically, she’s stealing from the business, causing system errors which I then have to correct and now shorting me on tips; all with her password privileges. AITA if I ask my boss to take her password away?"

At first I didn’t have a job so she payed for my food, room, and everything she could to help me while I continued my studies. As soon as I got a job, I started paying 200 for the room, and then had to start paying for my own things which I was fine with.  I pretty much had to pay for my own way of living. I was doing pretty well, and didn’t need to borrow money from anyone. On top of school, I was doing roughly 20-40 hours a week for work just to pay for my own things. Again, I was fine with this. However, my sister went on a business trip overseas, and while she was there she didn’t have enough money to book tickets to come home, as she borrowed money from her bank. I ended up forking out nearly $2,000 to help her get home, and I starved for the week she had traveled over seas because she asked if I could pay for her passport, and give any little bit I had to her. Because she is family I immediately said yes and did the best I could. She said she would pay me back as soon as she could, but as soon as I brought the money up to her her and her partner would change the subject, tell me how they had to prioritise their son, and told me I had to pay damages I did to the house. The damages I done were less than $300, $400 max. So when I deducted this from how much she owed me she started to make excuses. Not long after that she and her partner gave me a two week notice to leave the house, and it’s already been a couple of months since then. We are not on bad terms but they still expect me to pay for the damages to the house even though they are the ones that owe me. I am still trying to recover from her putting me in debt and making a living on my own, and so I feel bad that I can’t pay for the damages. Aita?

Edit: Thank you for all the advice and I have taken it on board, I will discuss it with them in person and let them know that I will not be paying for the damages, as well as take them to small claims court if they do not pay in the time they said they would (which was before the years end). I do have text messages as evidence. Her ‘business’ trip was for her own so no her job would not pay for her travels as it had nothing to do with them. I was going to move out by the end of the year anyways, and I’m glad I did."

z1mp8p_4785,z1mp8p,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,"I am 49, my wife 41, we have been living together for 9 years, married for almost 2 years. 2 years ago, she got a great job, managing a high end retail store for a midsize company. I was very proud, and happy for her. She went to Europe for training for 7-9 days, and was doing great. She worked Mon-Friday. 10-6, and every other Saturday. We have a blended family, her son, 12 lives with us 24/7, his father is not  in his life. I have raised him since he was 4. My daughter, 15, from a previous marriage is with us one week, then with her mom, the next week.

We live in a beautiful neighborhood, lovely home, that I bought before our marriage. We have no mortgage, no car payments, no debt, so my wife doesn’t work to pay the mortgage, or to put food on the table.

9 months ago, her boss the regional manager quit, and the company offered my wife the job. I was so happy for her, and proud. I knew it would mean her traveling a lot, which I didn’t want, but I was more than willing to deal with it, so she could have an opportunity that I knew she deserved and would give her such pride, self esteem and validation. 

I knew she would travel a few days, maybe 5 days every few weeks.  That was January.

She was away for our 1 year anniversary, she was away for Valentines Day. 4-5 days turned in to 2 weeks. Then the NY store manger quit, and it turned in to her needing to be living in NY, (we live in Miami) until the end of the year. Coming back to Miami for a week, then back to NY. 

So I am at home, taking the kids to school, making lunch, dinner, grocery shopping, taking care of everything in our lives. I am a 49 year old married man, living alone. I am raising her child, my child, a household, dogs, a cat, a fish, tortoises, and paying for everything, except for the electric bill, her $100k a year job paid for the electric bill. And I am running a company with 20 employees and a $50,000 payroll ever month. 

She’s in NY, working and living the single life. And when she comes home, she’s just so busy with emails and meetings. 

It’s gotten to the point where I actually don’t care. I enjoy it. There aren’t any arguments, things run smoothly without someone else’s opinions and interference. 

I have overly expressed my frustration and unhappiness with the Situation, emphasizing the effects it has on her 12 year old son. He needs his mother, he deserves a mom in his life, because the real father she gave him doesn’t care. I love him, I am there for him, but I can’t do it all.

AITAH, because I want to SHARE a life with the woman I married, not be married to a woman that chooses to devote and prioritize her life, her time, my life and my time, to a job?

Please let me hear what I already know, but I am just avoiding?"

Sister reached out after 6 months and basically tried to act like nothing happened and invited us for Thanksgiving. I let her know ""thank you but no your husband spoke clearly last time we were there.""

 Short backstory:(He pushed my 4yr old, told me he would ""throw"" my kid if he wanted and it was his house his rules and there's the door if I dont like it.) 

She asked me what had upset me about the last visit. (Like she had no clue even though she was standing right by me.) I let her know ""everything her husband said and did.""  To which all the sudden she remembered her version and told me he only got defensive once I said something ""very, very disrespectful."" And she informed me it was my job to reach out and resolve this issue and she told him not to apologize to me since I didn't pick up her 1 phone call or respond to her 1 comment on my Facebook picture. I emailed her letting her know how he had been low key aggressive and argumentative with me throughout the evening and that she had even upset us by telling us there would only be corn and potatoes left when we got there(we were going to get there on the agreed upon time)we decided to go to a restaurant instead but she called us back and said that there would actually be plently leftover. At one point that evening she had told me I was 1 step up from our younger brother (who she portrayed as a bum, with mental issues.), her husband yelled at me for simply saying: their dog was being nice to me when I had food (the dog nips at me and my kids every visit.). I then pointed reminded her that seconds before her husband pushed my kid, she had to put the dog up because it was following my kid nipping at the air around his feet. 

Her response to my email was a very long email back telling me how its my fault and I left them with bad feelings.  Her husband was just playing and they play more aggressive than us and I'm to sensitive and need therapy for my issues. That I should have apologized to them. That I miss heard him and he had said ""thow"" not throw. She also told me how hurt she was that I haven't called in all this time.  

We spoke on the phone and she did most the talking ie blaming me, but I let her know my only responsibility was to my kids and to get them out of that situation. (Im not responsible to reach out to people that show no remorse. I wouldn't apologize for protecting my kids and if it had been a game, her husband wouldn't have gone off on me when I told him I was uncomfortable with him talking like he was. He would have stopped if it had just been a game. She went on to tell me how I take parenting way to seriously and did I really think he would throw my kid. I told her why would I doubt what he felt comfortable enough to (loudly) tell me he would do right before he told us where the door was. I want to point out that before this incident I purposely made a point to call her 1-2x a month to check in and talk. I made a point not to call more because I've caught on over the years that she just doesn't reach out and I don't want to overwhelm her. Plus it does hurt that I'm the main one to put any effort in. She only calls on holidays. Mind you we live 35 min apart.

So AITA for refusing to apologize, for also unfriending her on social media/ blocking their #'s, and telling her if they have anything to say they can email me."

The cops thought it was weird he pretended to have them and said he moves them because he doesn't like them on my nightstand but he didn't take them this time. They said he could get charged with theft and they miraculously appeared.
The police must think I am a nutcase. I went and got a red bull and it helped.

. They suggested I sleep with my keys. I don't want to stay there any more. Everything turns into screaming lecture or a fight. He apologized but then started lecturing me on the importance of putting my keys in a good place. I told him to fuck off and left."

I spent 6 years of marriage to my daughters father being told he was a victim of sexual assault. It happened in high school when he was 18, and he was in therapy, had night mares, and struggled all around with it still in his late 20’s. I heard the story in detail multiple times, with him crying often. He’d vent about how ugly she was, tell me how awful of a parent she must have turned out to be, his mom would tell me what a crazy bitch she was. I just listened to him and helped him work through it how I could. 

There were issues in the relationship, and a lot of lying. To this day I don’t know much about who he really is. He lied about his religion multiple times, lied to get me to marry him….it was a mess. He’d even lie about simple things. There were more issues, but I won’t even open that door. It’s a novel. Needless to say I couldn’t stay with him any longer and fell out of love because of all the lies. I didn’t feel that the person I did love even existed, it was just lies upon lies. Now we share custody of our daughter. 

Just days after I broke up with him he was talking to the girl who SAed him. The same girl he had all the flashbacks about and hated. Now they’re together, and she’s my daughter’s “bonus mom” and tries to communicate with me about coparenting. He said he “set her straight” and things are fine now. His mom is very close with her and they all live together. 

I have no interest in talking to this woman. The entire situation makes me sick. I keep communication short. His mom keeps inviting me to family outings and I have nothing nice to say, so I stay quiet. Am I the asshole for being short with them and not doing family outings, etc, with our daughter? I just want them all away from me. They’re all acting like I’m crazy for not allowing them into my new life. I accepted its not my business, I just don’t want to like share Christmas dinner or go to brunch. As a victim of SA myself I’m so confused. But maybe people cope differently? If I’m being a jerk so be it. I’m just confused."

I've felt guilty everytime this has happened, but still feel like I'm not asking for much. I've also apologized after the many arguments. I am a full time first year teacher and have never been a morning person so I have my routine down to the minute. For 20 minutes in the morning I ask my boyfriend to stay out of our small bathroom in our 1 bedroom apartment so I can pee, brush my teeth, do my hair, makeup, then leave. He recently had surgery in a private spot and it is causing him to spend extremely long amounts of time in the bathroom, 30-45mins multiple times a day to have a movement and then do a sits bath. He is not incontinent but has to keep the area clean since an abcess was drained. He is a morning person and is usually up by the first alarm and then parks himself in the bathroom. For the past month every other morning he is still in the bathroom by the time I need it from 7:40-8am. AITA for having arguments with him about those 20 mins I need to get ready? I've asked him a million times to wait or make sure he's out by when I need it. He's already miserable from the surgery and so am I but I still feel like 20 mins isn't that much time to ask for myself since I work 40+ hours a week and he's home all day on sick leave from work and school."

I ended up being extremely tired after being at the store for 4 hours and that night I still had to do homework. When I was done he wanted something to eat and I was way tooo tired to cook anything so decided to get Taco Bell for us (I agreed to buy him food since he went with me shopping) but I was so exhausted that I accidentally backed into his car at 5mph. His car is already damaged since he hit a deer and his bumper was messed up. All I did was move the bumper a tiny bit more. Honestly not noticeable but he got mad at me for getting mad at myself (cuz he’s the one who should be upset since I hit his car). Now he’s demanding I pay him $75 and he’ll let it go instead of making me replace the whole bumper. Would I be the asshole if I didn’t pay him? I don’t think it’s a big deal but the principle of the situation is that I hit him so I need to own up to it. Although I can’t stop thinking about how even my abusive ex would not have made me pay.

 So I started dating this guy let’s call him John I’d heard some not so nice thing about him but to me he was amazing we dated for awhile and he was helping me find a car. I had my own money saved up but he found me a car for $300 all it needed was a break booster and a catalytic converter all stuff I can do on my own. About a week after that we went out drinking I don’t remember most the night besides pulling up to his house and falling asleep on the bathroom floor all while throwing up. But 7am I still wasn’t feeling too well so he took me home. I found out later that if your throwing up for 12+ hours it’s alcohol poisoning. After a few days he told me that we needed to spend some time apart I was a little hurt but he said we were still together so that’s how I conducted myself. I went out with friends and one was very drunk and trying to drive with it being a man I thought it would be a good idea to let him know that I was gonna drive my friend around and make sure he was safe, that’s when I noticed he had blocked me on EVERYTHING. I sent him a message anyway and drove my friend around he decided he wanted to go to a bonfire. When we got there I say my boyfriend was sitting on his tailgate with my “friend”(we can call her Blair) cuddled up. I tried to confront them right then but once they saw me they took off as fast as they could. I found his sister and asked her she then told me that she had been staying at their house since he had taken me to my house sick. 
    I was so mad I never wanted to see him again but he had the rest of my car money. So my mom took me to his house the next day. On the way there I saw Blair’s mom driving in the same direction I didn’t think much of it. When we got to johns house his sister met me at the door when I asked where he was she said they were both in the shower. After the shock of that she handed me his truck keys as I had it in his truck last after going through his truck and not finding it Blair’s mom pulled up. As she walked up to me she gave me a warm smile and asked how I was doing. Not being able to hold back I told her that Blair and MY boyfriend were in the shower and should be out soon. Her face went white and just then both Blair and John came out in towels and looked completely scared. I watched with a smile on my face as her mom screamed at her to get her clothes and get in the truck. She came out with all her stuff and her mom laid into her about how she was the most discussing person and she was raised so much better then that after a fighting match with John my mom (my hero!!!) laid into him in the best mom fashion and he looked so defeated. Later I heard that her parents sold her Jeep and all 3 of her horses and made her get a job to pay for all her stuff. So AITA?"

He usually has Thanksgiving at his parent's house which is nearby so last year we were able to split up the day and each spend time with our son. But this year he decided he's going to his gf's family's Thanksgiving instead which is in another state.  I told him obviously I'm not ok with him taking our son to his gfs house when he should be spending time with his own family.  I get that his Dad is his family too but I don't think my son should be with someone else's family who he's never met on Thanksgiving. He keeps telling me it's not that far away, only a couple hours, but honestly the distance isn't my problem.  My family has a huge gathering,  he has 4 cousins who love to play with him, and a new baby cousin who we haven't met yet. Given the 2 options I think he should stay home with me. 

AITA?

Edit: Just so you all know,  this never became any kind of a fight with him. He doesn't even seem upset about it. He's going to pick him up when he gets back in town. We communicate and coparent well together. It's very civil.

Also we do have a custody agreement. His lawyer is the one who added no crossing state lines without permission.  I wouldn't expect him to be ok with me doing the same"

He then went to use the bathroom and i  looked at the households, and my ex fiancée had been created as well, he also recreated my late mothers grave in the backyard, my dog, my child from a previous relationship, my baby mother and my exact current apartment, as well as loads of specific details like the car i drive, colleagues, friends and other exes. i was very deeply disturbed because i had just been assaulted by her brothers and had a bit of a nasty break up with her. I was so upset about this and freaked out that i deleted the world. However, he came back when i deleted and went ballistic at me for doing that and for snooping, we then screamed and i kicked him out and blocked him on everything because of how weirded out i am by the whole thing. he’s made me feel quite bad about it though since it seemed to be a strange hobby but my other friend said he’s gaslighting me. am i the asshole?"

z2u5dd_4847,z2u5dd,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Hi, this is my first post so bare with me, a few things for context. My boyfriend earns less than I do hourly rate but takes home more because of overtime. I planned a suprise 30th birthday party for him which cost roughly £500 and bought him a big table saw thingy which cost roughly £60.

So I recently turned 30, I love being on holiday so I thought if I have to turn 30 why not do it on a beach. So about a year ago I booked for myself and my partner to go to mexico. We each paid half in installments as my boyfriend didn't have any savings. I tell my boyfriend to start putting some money aside so he'll have some spending money. (This is relevant later).  So the week before we go to mexico I say to my boyfriend about getting some pesos. He says he only has £100 in his bank and he needs this for his MOT on his car. So I agree to use our joint account money which is for house stuff, like groceries and bills. I ask why he didn't save any money for mexico especially as he has been doing lots of overtime. He says he didn't get paid a lot the month before so he had to use the money he saved for mexico for everyday stuff like petrol. So this annoyed me a bit as he had a year to prepare and I specifically told him to put money aside each month, but I let it go and we went to mexico. Everything was going great, we had to be a bit more cautious than I would have liked due to the money issue. I didn't get to go to the mayan pyramids but hopefully I can go back one day and do this. So we see these people having dinner on the beach at sunset with fire torches and I say to my bf how romantic that would be and that I expect it gets booked up fast so if we wanted to do it we should speak to reception sooner rather than later. I was hoping he would take the hint and ask about doing this on my birthday to make the day really special. I had already arranged for us to go swimming with dolphins that day as it was something I have always wanted to do and my bf hadn't arranged anything. So on the day I woke up opened up my cards from friends and family, my bf got me a nice card but not what I would say was special. It didn't have 30 on it or wasn't a photo card, or didn't have a heartfelt message written in it. Just said happy birthday love you from boyfriend. There wasn't any present, which wasn't an issue I thought maybe he had got us an experience like diving or dinner on the beach like I had suggested. I would have been happy with anything like that as its the thought and effort that counts not an item or how much its worth. So we swim with dolphins and have an amazing time, get back to our hotel and get ready for dinner, i dress up extra nice incase he has anything special planned. He asks me where i want to go for dinner, our hotel had 3 restaurants although the food wasn't that great. I'm a bit suprised as I thought he had booked the beach dinner. I say I don't mind and let him pick thinking he'll say suprise and say we're going somewhere nice. He didn't. He made zero effort, none. He didn't even ask the hotel staff to sing happy birthday or bring decorations for the room. I was so disappointed, I wasn't expecting him to buy me an expensive gift as I know he struggles to save money. I just wanted him to make a tiny bit of effort. He then spent the rest of the evening downing free beer after free beer and getting drunk. When we got back to our room he started coming on to me and whispered in my ear happy birthday like it was something sexy. I have never been so turned off in all my life and told him I wasn't having sex with him. He got mad and asked why we couldn't have special birthday sex. I asked him why he hadn't made any effort for me on my special day. He said he didn't have the money to buy me a gift and he spoke to the receptionist that morning but that the beach dinner was booked that night. I asked him why he didn't book it earlier in the week or arrange for us to go out for dinner to a restaurant outside the hotel, or arrange a trip. He said he didn't think of it until the day, and didn't think I would want to eat out when we had paid for all inclusive. I went to bed early and felt really disappointed. The next morning I woke up and my bf wasn't speaking to me, so it made me think AITA?"

z2wep6_4854,z2wep6,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Background info: I (25f) have four kids (5f, 5m, 4m, 1.5f) with my husband (27m). My husband comes from a well off family. Like I mean upper upper class family. Last week we decided to go out with my sister (23f) BIL (27m) their 5 kids (7f, 7m, 7m, 3f, “0.6m at home”). We go to the store my 3 kids run into a candy store we go after them.

And my kids start picking out candy a LOT of candy I looked at my husband he gave me a look “it’s fine”.
BIL and sister checked the candy and said no. My husband started paying and the candy costs 90£ .I mean 90£?!. Turns out one packet cost 30£. My husband payed and we continue walking.

We go to the clothing aisle we pick out dresses and shirts for my kids BIL and sis do the same. We pay 230£. Next we go to the food court place and eat 5f gets KFC 5m gets Pizza 4m gets happy meal. I share pizza with 4m. My husband gets uh I forgot sorry? We pay 102£ I think? 

After that my kids ask me if they can go get ice cream we pay 39£. Then we go to the aquarium we pay 20£ per each person so 240£. Then my kids buy toys, dolls we pay 134£. At the end of the day we end up spending almost 1k. After we went home and had dinner my BIL and sister pulled me aside and told me it was disrespectful to flaunt my money in front of them.

I said what do you mean? They said all day I’ve been buying my kids expensive things knowing they can’t afford it. But the thing is they never told me they didn’t have money or I would pay for their kids as well. They told me that i didn’t say no to my kids even one time. I apologized to them but then they said to return all the things. I mean wtf NO. But my reasoning is that I didn’t say no because my kids and I haven’t been out in a while and our maid accidentally broke my daughter doll house so she was extremely sad.

I know the prices were extremely high but my husband argues with me if I say no and he’ll straight up ignore me. 

That’s why we went out. So am I TA Reddit?"

Apparently, I’m the asshole for choosing rest, relaxation and myself this holiday. I don’t particularly care for thanksgiving or Christmas and prefer to spend these holidays recharging. Apparently I’m weird for that lol"

Recently, i have been so annoyed at my(21f) bf (21m). He never wants to do ANYTHING. He barely wants to hang out in general. We see each other once a week and its usually just us sitting in his room and me watching him sleep. I work and do school from home so i rarely get to leave the house, so on the weekends im dying to do an activity or at least get some sunlight! 

I ask him to go cross country skiing. He says no he doesnt like that. I ask him to go skating. He says he doesnt have skates and doesnt want to buy them for $10 from goodwill. I ask him if he wants to go for happy hour. He doesnt want to spend money. I ask if he wants to predrink at my place and go out with my roommates. He doesnt want to go to the bar. The only thing he'll say yes to is going on a walk, but when it actually comes down to it he wont get up and do it. 

This weekend my roommates are going out but my bf doesnt want me to go (doesnt like me going out without him there, but doesnt want to come with) he said we can go for happy hour instead if i pay. I dont want to spend $100 on a bill (also keep in mind i pay rent, utilities, insurance, gas, groceries while he lives at home and has no bills + rich parents) just for him to want to go home and watch a movie right after, fall asleep and not wake up until 12pm and go home as soon as he wakes up. We never even have sex anymore. 

I feel like im the only one trying to keep the relationship alive and at this point im so turned off i dont even know if i have feelings for him anymore. I know he doesnt want to break up, as anytime i bring up any kind of serious topic he gets anxious and says ""promise you wont leave me"", yet stopped putting effort in. 

Anyways. Ive been working super hard all week and i wanna go out, preferably with him, but he doesnt want to go. Should i just end it?"

Anyways. Ive been working super hard all week and i wanna go out, preferably with him, but he doesnt want to go. Should i just end it?"

z3nd2a_4903,z3nd2a,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Do I sound like an absolute spoiled brat? 

Today is my birthday and my parents had asked me specifically what I wanted. I linked my dad to a necklace I really wanted that was around $50.00 USD and I said that that was the only thing I truly wanted. 

My dad’s birthday was two weeks before mine, and I had written him a check to buy whatever he wanted (he is hard to shop for). The check I wrote him was for $250.00 and told him to use it on himself. I gave him more than I usually ever do because I was trying to pay for his gift to me. I know my dad hates spending money so I figured if I included enough money for my gift in his gift, then he could easily get it. 

My family is financially very well to do. When calculated, my parents fall in the category of “more wealthy than 92% of the US population. I would never dare ask them for a gift for $50.00 if I thought my parents were financially struggling. Money, to me, isn’t the issue here. It’s the thoughtfulness. 

ANYHOW, my dad had left his email open on his computer upstairs and I happened to read it (ok I snooped, my bad). He went back and forth with this Etsy seller on the necklace asking for a discount and she wouldn’t budge. 

My dad then makes up a story to me about how hard he tried to order it but the Etsy seller wasn’t shipping it anymore. He was apologetic over and over and I let it go. But when I saw the email and checked the website, I found it was all a lie. 

I opened my gift today and it was a knock off version of the necklace from our local grocery store and it looked nothing like the one I wanted. It said “faith over fear” which is what the necklace I wanted said. But my dad left the price tag on the back that said $40.00. Inside the bag, he forgot to remove the clearance sticker underneath that said the necklace was $12.00. He bragged about how he spent so much on me and I acted elated. I told him I loved it. 

But I am sad. Not at the amount of money spent on me. I don’t care. I’m just sad my dad’s cheapness is so extreme that he can’t even get me something that I really wanted, especially when I had basically given my dad the extra money to do it. I just wanted to know if he would’ve actually done it, but he didn’t. 

My mom got me a t-shirt and hair clips and put stickers that had prices on them that were much higher and very obviously fake to try to prove to me that she spent a lot. 

It bothers me. I don’t need them to ACTUALLY spend anything. But if my dad would’ve actually given ANY thought to me, I would not be so sad. 

Before anyone comments about how they could secretly be struggling — it isn’t true. My parents have been extremely extremely frugal their entire life and have BLOWN up at me when they found out I donated to a charity. 

They NEVER TIP at restaurants, never give a penny to anyone in need, etc. My dad very often pulls up his savings account on his computer to brag about how much is in there. 

It isn’t a money issue. But it’s a thought issue. 

Am I the biggest brat for being upset? 

My dad also “took me out to lunch” for my birthday but made me pay."

He refuses to take baths unless i refer to it as ""swamp time"". he only eats off of the Shrek themed plates and utensils I got him to support his interest. As stated in my last post, he makes we watch Shrek with him and doesn't let me go to the bathroom or scroll on my phone during the movie. Because of this, I lost a excellent job opportunity because I couldn't answer the phone. I've also lost contact with many family members and friends because I couldn't answer them in time.  I tried to find babysitters so I could live my life but they all quit after the first night of watching Shrek. the time between each viewing has shortened from 30 minutes down to a measly 10. When he recently shortened the time to 5 minutes is when I lost it. In a moment that's not one of my proudest, I snatched the Shrek DVD from the player and snapped it in half. He was devastated beyond tears and I honestly think he's taking this worse than the death of my husband. Now he's saying that he's going to have a funeral that I'm not invited to and I don't know what to do. I refuse to watch Shrek again, and won't buy him a new DVD. Any advice? :](P.S. don't try to tell me he could have autism, because I ruled that possibility out since he isn't vaccinated)

Update: What is a troll? Also, autism is not the main focus of this post. Most of you are doing a poor job of explaining why autism isn't caused by vaccines. that's what I've always been told.

A little bit of backstory, my great aunt told me and my mum that her daughter had separated from her husband when the children were young. The eldest child is definitely his, not sure about the middle child but the youngest is definitely not. All three are female. The youngest (f27) doesn't know that her dad isn't her dad. My great aunt has since passed away, only the parents in question, me, my mum and my grandad know the truth. The eldest (f32) suspects something, but we haven't said anything. The middle (f30) were not sure if she knows or not. The question is are we right to keep this secret, we've all been told never to tell her (f27) about her biological father, but I doubt my decision to agree to keep the secret.
The parent's are not going to tell her, do I pretend I don't know and let them decide to keep their secret, or do I tell the truth.
I'm asking because I know it's not my place to say anything, but I think she deserves to know.

Edit- She hasn't spoken to her mum in years and she moved out of her dad's place after an argument and they have gone low contact, I don't think I should say anything because I don't know what head space she's in. Looking for opinions, should I tell her when things have settled down, or just leave it alone. I'm leaning more towards leaving it alone as I feel it really isn't any of my business."

She took the largest of three rooms, saying she and her bf need the space. The other room is a decent enough size, and I am okay with it.

It went a little down hill from there.

I took both of the remaining rooms. The smallest bedroom is maybe 5m2. I turned it into an office. We already discussed turning the shed, which is much larger, into a hobby room. It is insulated, and has power. It is a space where she can have her hobbies in peace. Plus, their bedroom is around 4m2 larger than mine. It seems like a fair set up.

Yesterday, she expressed how she didn't look forward into moving in with me, how she preferred having a place for herself. Kinda a warning sign.

Then she complained about how she wanted that third bedroom to herself, as her hobby room, and suggested I move my computer into my room. At that point it gets cramp. There has been displeasure at some of my furniture, and statements saying I shouldn't depend on them for support.

I can sense she is not happy, and I expect this to be a big deal. I am already starting to feel like this won't be my place. That I am going to be pressured out by them.

At first he wanted to call all of his friends aunt and uncle but I told him that was a lot so he just started calling these two particular friends that. 

So the reason I'm having issues with it is because is because of everything that's been going on. Originally we had made them our daughter's Godparents but I'm having severe second thoughts. They have had very troublesome childhoods and are just now receiving therapy and healing from it which is awesome I'm just not sure they'd be ready to take on the responsibility of a child should something happen to us. 

I love his friends, but it concerns me. Today he told me he wanted to go even farther with the aunt and uncle thing and not let our kids know they weren't really related to us. I asked him what would we say if they directly asked us one day if we were related and he said we would just tell them we were. I don't really know what this doesn't sit well with me but it doesn't. I told him I didn't like that but he doesn't agree with me. 

We didn't fight or anything because I dropped the conversation after that but I'm just wondering if I would be the AH if I were to tell him that I don't like this at all.


The reason I feel like I might be the AH is because it is his kid to and he does get a say in the way she's raised.

Edit 1: 

Thank you to everyone who has commented! I guess I didn't realize it was a normal thing for people to call friends aunt or uncle! 

I do just want to say I am in no way, shape, or form trying to judge these people for their past and the things that have happened. I know a lot of the comments focused on that and felt I wasn't being fair to them but there is more to the story then I've put here.

Edit 2:

So again, I'm receiving a lot of comments about how I'm judging them and I just want to reiterate that this is not the case. As it stands they do not have any children of their own and have communicated to us that the reason for this is because they aren't in the best place with their healing journey.

I told him I couldn't pick up McDonald's because it was closed, he was mad at me for not driving around to find something open. He brought up how during my pregnancy how I wanted jalapenos and he went looking for them, (never got them, said store was out) but he expected me to do the same since he was starving. He didn't talk to me all night and I told him how it hurt my feelings that he was being mean to me and I would like an apology, he said he didn't do anything wrong and that I should have went looking for food. Mind you, he had the whole day off and we have plenty of food in the house. He said he didn't want to leave anywhere because he had our daughter (3) and my daughter (10) with him. I fed the baby left over Mac and cheese and my oldest ate cereal for dinner. He's still mad at me. I kept saying it was a national holiday and nothing was open but that wasn't a good enough reason. I settled for an egg sandwich, which I ate through tears. I'm still crying while cooking our Thanksgiving meal now. I don't feel I did anything wrong. I saw everything was closed and just wanted to be home. Now he's saying he's not gonna do anything for me since I can't do the simplest thing for him. Am I the a hole?"

z4yqwa_4990,z4yqwa,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I recently found out I’m pregnant with a boy! When looking for boy names… I wanted a strong name that I also didn’t hear often. So I decided to go with ___, which is also my step dad’s middle name. My biodad and mom divorced when I was 3 and he then moved 10 hours away. I maybe saw him 3x a year. When my mom met my step dad, he quickly stepped into the role; giving advice, driving lessons, attending all events etc. He considers me his daughter, not “step” 

Well my bio dad asked me where (name) came from and I was honest with him. Now he is upset with this and is insisting I give my child his middle name and I don’t want to. They’re (dad and stepmom) making me feel horrible about it. I’m sure he’s not happy, and I can understand, but I don’t think my child should have to carry his name when he has basically done nothing to raise me, besides sending child support. 

Am I the asshole?"

Of course none of this is her fault, she can't help it. She has argued that she can't be herself when he's around and she feels like he's taking away her time with mum. 

Our mother had a conversation with me and my other sister about him moving in, we stated our reasons why we don't feel like he should move in yet. She started complaining that we want her to be alone forever and what is she supposed to tell people when they ask why they haven't moved in yet. She told us to take our sister out of the picture, we said we can't because she lives here. She's started behaving badly at school since mum and her bf got together, we spend very little time with mum now because she goes to her bf's house every weekend and works in the week. I haven't gone to the gym in months because my gym won't let me to go without her.

She says most parents don't even ask their kids if their partners can move in. She used my dad as an example, he didn't even tell me his gf was moving in till after she had moved in, they had been together for 2 years, I knew her well, I'm neurotypical and only went there every other weekend.

He yells get outta my sightttt when he is manic .he moves everything when he is manic and then screams at me all night for not knowing where he put it. He breaks everything esp my stuff when he is manic. 

Sometimes I yell too but I try not too. It was really frustrating when he kicked me out of the house and told me to leave but my keys were in the house . 
  When he is in a manic phase everything is my fault.He also paces constantly. He wants to argue constantly and says you are lying it's your fault over and over . He also screams shut up over and over. Like the one day he asked me why I hide in my room I come out and starts screams shut the hell up what the hell do you think you are doing out here get the f out?????? he won't take medicine and thinks I am overreacting for leaving."
z58ew0_5009,z58ew0,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"The title makes it sound a lot worse than it actually is, but everyone in my life is telling me different things. So for some background me and my sister used to be super close and talk all the time. She met her now fiancé and she started not talking to me quite as much but I took it as she had a more important things in life and it did hurt but I was happy for her. Her fiancé apparently went on a rant to my parents about how they should’ve made me get an abortion or kick me out for getting pregnant(I was 17 and took every precaution). But I never brought it up to my sister because he just grew up in a different family atmosphere than I did. My sister was super supportive of my now husband when I was dating him and even when he proposed. But then I(21f) and my daughter moved in with my husband(then fiancé) 2.5 years ago. When I did my sister(24f) basically told me how terrible I am for doing that and how my daughter is going to get taken away because my husband is just on welfare and is probably on drugs and just overall a terrible human being. I went low contact with her for a few months. We had been super close and talked nonstop up until this point. Which let me just say none of that was true he worked 2 jobs and the only recreational thing he bought was guns because he liked to hunt and go to the shooting range but he always made sure he had way more than enough for everything we needed. Me and my sister barely spoke for probably a month then I reached out to her to create peace for the family and because I missed my sister. We were still distant because we had our own lives. But she would always make plans with me and cancel or just not respond so I end up doing things alone because I was already there waiting for her. Back to when we were teens we always planned on having each other be bridesmaids. Then I hear from my parents that she absolutely did not want me to be a bridesmaid but had her fiancés sister as one of her bridesmaids. That really hurt me but I always try and be the bigger person just to keep peace and because of some childhood trauma I have confrontation. I texted her apologizing for whatever happened between us that made her not want me as a bridesmaid and I am just happy she gets to enjoy her day and no matter what I will be there and be so insanely supportive and happy for her. She then starting screaming at me over text saying this is why she didn’t want me as a bridesmaid because I make everything about myself and was going to ruin the day for her. I told her I’m sorry that I made that impression on her and I will not attend so I don’t ruin the day for her. This caused basically ww3 between her and the family because our whole family is on my side saying she is being a bridezilla and they don’t even want to attend her wedding. My mother is the only one who is on her side. My mother told me I shouldn’t have said anything and should’ve just went along with it to keep the peace. But my husband has been pushing me to stand up for myself more because I let people walk all over me and he sees how much it drains me. I just want to know if I am in the wrong or not because my mom sent me messages like every other day trying to guilt me into creating a relationship with her again and she cut off contact with my parents and went low contact with the rest of the family. I just feel so terrible for causing so much family drama over being a bridesmaid."
z58m73_5014,z58m73,top-comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Last Saturday I (M/22) went to a seminar at my university. When I walked into the room one girl caught my eye, she was completely my type. At the beginning of the seminar, the lecturer created groups of 2. As fate would have it, the girl that caught my eye, Hannah (W/21), and I got into one group. Neither Hannah nor I knew anyone in that seminar. So we just stuck together the whole day. We talked, laughed, joked around, and even flirted a bit in the end. The chemistry was great, so I asked her out and we exchanged numbers.

This Friday we finally went on a date together. I picked her up and we drove to a park. We went for a walk and then went to the Christmas market that just opened that day in the park. The date was great, the best date I have ever had. The chemistry was great and we feel for each other. After 2,5 hours or so, I asked her if she wanted to go eat something. There is an excellent restaurant in the park, but she said she got a better idea. She didn't say what exactly but I went along. We then drove to a bowling alley, which also has a great restaurant. She told me she likes bowling and that it will be a lot of fun. I was excited for 2 seconds, but then she continued speaking and the greatest date turned into the worst.

She told me that every Friday at around 7 pm, she and her friend group go bowling together. Guess what, it was around 7 pm when we got there and I already knew what is going to happen next. So we walked in and there were her friends sitting. 8 people, including her slightly older brother and his gf, as well as Erik and his gf (Hannah´s bf) and some others. I only knew Erik, because he is a friend from the gym. We walked over, they seemed surprised to see her there. She introduced me. They knew that she was on a first date, so they asked if I am the guy and stuff like that. I wasn't comfortable with any of this. First of all, because it was a first date, and never ever would I include someone else in a first date, let alone a whole friend group. Secondly, I knew this is going to be weird for everyone involved but especially me and I felt serious pressure to not fuck this up.

She was really happy and all excited to introduce me and the date was so great until then, so I just went along. I tried to not show how uncomfortable I was and they were all nice, so it wasn't a big deal. Throughout the evening they were (one by one) asking me personal/serious questions (besides Erik and his gf), they were telling me things about Hannah (only good things obv) and the longer everything went the more it felt like a job interview. It's clear to say, they were checking me out and trying to figure out whether I´m a good fit for Hannah or not. I got more and more annoyed by this. Erik and his gf wanted to get them to leave me alone a couple of times but it didn't work. Hannah and I talked a bit here and there, but obviously, we couldn´t talk like before, which annoyed me even more. She was trying to, but it was impossible as you can imagine.

After we played some bowling and ate, it became quieter and we were all sitting there. Then her brother began a conversation with me (everyone was listening) and I went from being annoyed to upset. It seemed like he wanted me to prove my worth and put me in my place. It felt more like a shitty conversation you have with your overprotective father-in-law when you meet him for the first time. Quite honestly it was ridiculous and I reacted that way. I laughed about it and asked him if this was a joke. I then turned to Hannah and said I would like to talk to her in private outside. Her brother's gf then backed her brother up and said they were just trying to have a normal chat with me and I should relax. Erik tried to change the topic, unfortunately without any success. So I asked Hannah again if we could talk alone. She was uncomfortable I could tell, but then said, that we could talk here. At this point, I was fed up, so I got up, took my jacket, and told her I´m waiting outside if she wants to talk to me.

Hannah came after me and already had tears in her eyes. She apologized for her brother's behavior and how the evening went. She could tell that there are things I wanted to say, so she told me she can handle it and that I should speak up now that we are alone. I knew that she can't handle it right now, but told her anyway. I told her, that until we got to the bowling alley this was the best day ever, and the moment we came here it became the worst. I told her how uncomfortable I was right from the start. That it was inappropriate to bring me here on a first date and what she was thinking. She was crying and I felt terrible, but I continued. I told her it felt like a trap so her friends could check me out and that they were asking me questions that she should have asked me and not them. I told her that I learned more about her through her friends than through her, even though I wanted her to tell me those things. I paused after that because she was crying a lot and I tried to comfort her, but I just couldn't at that moment. I told her and said I need to go. She was begging me to stay, apologized again, and offered that we do something alone. I said I don't want to and that I need time for myself. She asked if there is any chance that we meet up again and I told her honestly, that I don't know yet. I asked if one of her friends can give her a ride home, and she said yes and I left.

I slept like 2 hours tonight because I feel like shit and regret how I handled the situation. Erik wrote me a message this morning, telling me how much Hannah regrets bringing me there and letting her friends question me like that. He wrote that he doesn't think that she did plan this as everyone was as surprised as I was when we walked in. He also wrote, that this was probably a naive mistake and I should consider giving Hannah another chance. Hannah also wrote me a long message, apologizing again and asking if we could speak about it. I wrote I need some time to think about it.

I´m conflicted. On one hand, I know her apology is sincere and I feel like I should give her a chance to explain herself even after this shitshow. On the other hand, everything that happened in this bowling alley is such a major red flag for me and I don't think that any of this should happen on a first date. I can't forget about this and move on like it never happened.

AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Went on a first date, she brought me to her friend group, they questioned me until I lost my shit and I left her crying outside.

z5hzkx_5021,z5hzkx,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,"A little background: I am a full time stepmother to 3 kids (now F18, M20, F22). They have lived with me being the primary parent while my husband traveled frequently for work and their mom got visitation every other weekend!

Trouble with my stepson started when he was 10. Stealing, lying, invasion of my personal space and bedroom. He would steal other kids cell phones and jailbreak them to look at porn. He was Stealing my clothing and personal items, etc. We got a lock on our bedroom door and stepson would break in. 

There was also trouble at school. He did not have friends and was found Stealing kids things there as well. He was put into counseling for years and it never really got better. I would have to drive him to the counseling and he would do rude things like play ""Stacey's Mom"" and try to talk about inappropriate topics with me. My husband had to quit his job to be around more, but that still didn't help. 

As my stepson got older, his lies got more complex and believable, and he started gaslighting his father and my inlaws (which they believed.) He also started sneaking out of the house, sneaking into his girlfriend's house, buying and drinking alcohol, contacting girls who were 12 or 13 online when he was 16 and 17. His behavior only got worse. (Honestly me staying married to my husband the whole time was a miracle in itself which we were in couples counseling for.) 

Fast forward to 3 months after stepson graduated from high school and I find sticky stuff on my master bathroom floor, again, and yes that sticky stuff. I talk to my husband and he reluctantly agrees that my stepson should move out and we call his mother who (finally) agrees it will be best for him to come live with her. Stepson blows up angrily when we tell him what I found on the bathroom floor and denies it is his and threatens to move in with his mom (which he always pulled out that comment because he knew it would hurt my husband.) However when I tell him we've already talked to his mom and that he should pack a bag and head there now, stepson starts bawling crying. 

Long story short his mother comes down to get him and his younger sister drives his car to his moms because mom says he's too emotional and can't drive. Fast forward a bit and the entire extended family still believe that I am TA for kicking him out. (And I made my husband tell them all what stepson had done to me.) They repeatedly tell me every holiday that they can't  believe I kicked him out and they believe that had he ""been my real son"" that I would have let him keep living with me.

So After he got out of high school, after he was 18, and after I had been dealing with his destructive behavior for over 10 years while he was growing up...AITA for kicking my stepson out of the house?"

They repeatedly tell me every holiday that they can't  believe I kicked him out and they believe that had he ""been my real son"" that I would have let him keep living with me.

So After he got out of high school, after he was 18, and after I had been dealing with his destructive behavior for over 10 years while he was growing up...AITA for kicking my stepson out of the house?"
z5me6m_5028,z5me6m,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,"I (21F) got in a huge argument with my (41M) step-dad last week over finances regarding my education and living situation. I apologize in advance if i'm giving too many details but I think they are important for the full story. 

For some context I'm the eldest of 5 children (3 from my moms side) 13F half-sis mom shared, 19F full sis, (2 from step-dad) 15M step-sibling and 19F step-sibling. My half-sis (13F) is with her dad 50% of the time, my full sis and I's father stopped paying child support when I was 10 and is out of the picture due to alcoholism, and my step siblings mother passed away in 2011. My mother and step father got together in 2013 and we re-located to the city my step father already lived in that same year to all live together.

We all apart from my 13F half-sis lived with our parents full time up until last year when my (19F step-sis) moved out with her bf into one of those portable trailers that attach to the back of a truck bed parked on her grandfathers property (my step grandpa). She moved out due to conflict with my parents. She is attending uni next semester through student loans at a local college. 

My step-dad makes around 175k a year managing his fathers company with him, and my mother although holds a diploma in nursing (LPN in Canada) has not worked for the last year and a half.

Now that the backstory is in place I can get into it. My parents are currently not speaking to me over an argument I had a week ago with my step-father. It started out as my brother getting a form signed to go into full-time IB for his grade 11 and 12 year. I asked why he was doing IB, my parents explained it was because he gets his first year off of uni credits. This is only true if he is going into a general degree and a couple weeks ago he was telling everyone he wanted to go into Architecture (IB will not count), I think it's a bad idea, his credits will not count towards the degree he wants to go in and he has awful study habits, I don't think he understands the amount of effort he will have to put into IB, none of the less, not my problem, but this is how the conversation started. 

I asked how he is going to afford to go to university as I have been having an extremely hard time affording it myself and my parents said ""what do you mean of course we will help him, all of you kids are going to go to university"". I responded with ""you have not helped me I have had to delay my studies in order to afford it myself"". This turned into an argument where both me and my step father were raising our voices, and me crying while my mother did not say much. She chimed in saying I transferred money to her a couple times but my step dad didn't really listen. My step-father was insisting he payed 6K towards my school, then brought the number down to 3K, when in reality it has been $0-500 he has contributed. Where this gets confusing is we have been using his account to pay my tuition and I have transferred my mother the money as my college does not accept transfers through my specific bank. My dads money is my moms money, she does not work but they have both joint and separate accounts. All in all for 30 credits of my BSN &amp; a 6 month certificate program I took has cost $8400. $3196 I have proof I transferred (my bank only lets me go back a year), 1.9K from my moms parents I have proof of, and 1.5K my bio dads mom gave me. 1800$ is unaccounted for as I can't go that far back in my banking, there is no record. He had his finger pointed in my face calling me a brat, spoiled and selfish for reacting harshly for calling him out on his lie. He has not contributed to my school, for him to be remotely right that would mean I paid for nothing of my 30 credits when I did, I transferred my mother money, we don't know the exact amount. I can remember 1 semester he MAYBE topped off around $500 and that is being generous. 

Due to his income I cannot get student loans, I have applied, they sent a letter back saying I qualified for 0$. The average cost of a 1 bedroom basement suit where I live is $1600 a month. It is next to impossible to afford rent as a student. In order to be classified as an independent student not attached to my parents income I have to be 4 years post graduated HS, or live on my own for 1 whole year. MAX student loan is 1.5k per month. For my major (nursing) I have to have a vehicle, it is noted in the entrance requirements as some clinical placements are 1-2 hr drive away from the school, 12hr shifts with no transiting options. So this is another expense. I live 1.5-2hr commute to any uni/ college, 3-4hr both ways. I pay 100% of my car expenses $500 fixed (250 insurance lowest possible for my age I know crazy here in British Columbia, 250 paying my parents back as they paid upfront) + gas. 10k tuition a year when I continue. I went to school Monday-Friday and worked Saturday &amp; Sundays. No days off for months. The only thing my parents help out with is not charging me rent or food (I'm small I eat maybe $200 worth of groceries a month), their rent would not go down if I moved out, they would probably use my room as storage. I plan on moving out for the other 3 years of my BSN with my bf but without saving 1.5k/month for the next year I wont be able to afford it, even with max student loans. AITA for expecting them to contribute to my education when they said they will be helping my brother? AITA for calling him out on his lie? I have delayed my education for so long as I can't get loans. I have been the only child in university for the last 3 years.

z5qj6c_5036,z5qj6c,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I (20F) am expecting my first born this new year with my (20M) boyfriend. I found out extremely late into the pregnancy that I was expecting, so late in fact that one week later I discovered I was already 5 months along. I’m 8 months pregnant later and have to start making decisions regarding my birth plan and post birth plans.

I should probably explain some certain things to be clear. My plan isn’t to shut out every visitor. My parents, his parents, both our grandparents and my little sister will be allowed to visit. His siblings who already have kids can visit depending on whether or not they have been recently sick, which is a condition I made clear to everyone and they all happily agreed.

This is regarding two people in particular, and while I do not like to exclude anyone, and never have, I have certain reservations about allowing some people around my son in his very early stages. Specifically my older sister and her long term boyfriend.

Don’t misunderstand please, I love my sister. Always have always will. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have a rocky relationship at best. For example, when I told her about my pregnancy the first time, her answer was “what the f were you thinking?” And later on the phone when discussing that I would like to be left alone the first couple of days after my son’s birth she remarked that “it’s MY nephew and I want to see him.”

I have several concerns. Primarily, her sense of personal hygiene. For reference, every time I’ve seen her in person or over FaceTime in the last three or so years, she has been unclean and dishevelled. This may have some underlying meaning which I have tried to help her with many times but she always grows defensive and refuses to talk about it, and it makes me sad to think that maybe the reason is, she is too embarrassed to ask for help. That is for another post though. Her boyfriend who I barely interact with is also very bad with hygiene. At our cousin’s wedding last month, neither of them had showered and both were visibly dirty, hadn’t washed their clothes and he wore jeans. 

Now I’m not unreasonable, I like to think. I can deal with someone not showering or brushing hair, it doesn’t bother me all that badly, it’s just that they work with horses on the regular and I am reluctant to expose my newborn to horse hair so early in life. It’s not in my plan for my son to be around farm animals for at least a few months after birth because I simply can’t predict how he would react to it. Considering how both my boyfriend and my mom are allergic, I don’t want to risk anything with him so early. 

I have made broad statements to everyone regarding that clean, sanitized hands and clean clothes are needed when they will be interacting with my son but she has directly been asked to change into cleaner clothes before and simply refused. 

I have presented my concerns to my mom and she responded with, “well he is her nephew and she will want to see him and might feel left out if you don’t let her come around.” 

I don’t really know how to proceed. I feel like as the parents, my boyfriend and I should have final say in who is allowed to visit in the first couple weeks.

AITAH?"

The other day I was at Walmart when I saw a woman, who was visibly exhausted and not doing well, steal some baby food and diapers. Before she took any of the items, she looked at the prices, most likely trying to find the cheapest one, then checked her pockets for money. Im assuming she didnt have much or any, because she looked defeated and just grabbed the diapers and baby food. Now, I was raised to always tell the truth, but I felt bad. She needed those things for her baby. So I didnt say anything. I talked to my mom and she says she understands how I felt, but I should of said something and that I probably cost Walmart money. So, AITA??"

I’m not sure if I love him, he’s kind and caring but now our family is pressuring me to set a date and start a family because “max isn’t getting any younger” he’s 34 now and I’m struggling. I don’t know if I love him because I was technically given to him on a gold plate and never experienced anything else. My older sister keeps telling me that it’s love because he opens doors for me and buys my flowers but honestly I don’t think it is! 

The reason I was handed off and not my older sister is because Maxs father had a pick of us."

He got me the investment “deal” and made all the calls to the guy. My boyfriend had made any deals before and apparently a lot of profit  but kept investing it and eventually lost it all plus his saving. When he was making profit I was struggling in life he was very giving and sweet and wanted the best for me. He did do a lot for me and i recognized that and when I got money a couple months later I paid him back for the services and things he got for me when I was down. I was grateful for what he did and further gave back in ways like cleaning, doing errands ect. I never expected him to pay for me or give me any of his profits but now he is saying he needs mine. I feel bad he lost everything but I feel he put me in a horrible situation because I almost lost everything and now he wants my profit because he did.

She made it clear she was done with me. She stated she wanted me out of her life, requested i stop texting/calling and then blocked me in her phone and fb. 

I respected her wishes and went no contact. After a few days of no contact she reached out to ask me if I had canceled reservations made for her birthday which was coming up in 6 days. I had made a fb event - so alot of friends were planning on attending (dinner and a jazz club). I didn't cancel either one as I still love this girl and didn't want to be spiteful.

I sent her a text back letting her know i didnt cancel either one. She proceeded to get the info for the reservations and then asking me to delete the fb event only and she would send a mass text to everyone to take overnaging the event....and obviously she didn't want me to attend incase I was planning on it.

Ok so at this point it clear she doesn't want to hear from me so I resume not reaching out to her as she requested. I maintain no contact through the day of her birthday. I wake up to a text from her she sent at 130am that says

""....Happy birthday. Hope it was a great""

z6aehs_5073,z6aehs,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,"This morning, my (30f) mil texted me saying she was having a late Thanksgiving dinner this afternoon at her house (Sunday after Thanksgiving). We already had plans to go to town today and get our groceries for the next couple weeks. We live in a very rural area, so it's about a 3 hr round trip just to get to the grocery store and back plus shopping time. We have 3 kids, 3f, 5m and 9f, so grocery shopping tends to take a while with them. We prefer to go as a family since it's a long round trip, so we make an afternoon out of it, take the kids to the park, and get dinner while we are out.

My sil (21f) had mentioned the dinner on Wednesday asking if we were going, and I told her we hadn't heard anything about it. She said she wasn't sure if it was even happening and it had been mentioned but wasn't a for sure plan. I figured when I hadn't heard anything else about it yesterday morning that it must not be happening.

My husband (32m) told her that we wouldn't make it and that we already had stuff going on today. She then proceeded to tell him that we had dinner on Thanksgiving with my parents and his dad and that we weren't making time for her. He reminded her that she was out of town for Thanksgiving and she didn't say anything about it until this morning, so we had already made plans for the afternoon to go in and do our shopping.  She asked him why we weren't alreadyin town mid morning and if we were ""making bedsores"" (My bil and my husband's cousin have been at our house since Friday and we were waiting to take them home (1 hour round trip) before leaving to do our grocery shopping) My husband finally just said we would try to make it if we could but no promises.

My husband now is saying it's my choice now on if we go or not to the dinner since I would have to change around my schedule to do the shopping during the week if we didn't go today since my work hours flexible and his are not. He said it's not a big deal to him if we go to the dinner or not, so whatever decision I make is fine with him. So wibta if I decided not to go to my mil Thanksgiving dinner?


Update: I decided we would not be changing our plans to attend, and my husband agreed it was the right choice, so he called and said we would not be able to make it. She got very upset and told us we didn't care about her as much as my family, and if we did care we would be there no matter what we had going on. My husband told her that next time, we would need some prior notice to be able to accommodate her plans. Then he said bye and hung up before she could continue to lecture him."

z6rwsr_5080,z6rwsr,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"The day my husband and I got married was a total and complete disaster. We laugh at it now and find it to be just a funny day to tell the kids, but EVERYTHING that could have gone wrong did. As well, the day before the wedding was the first time I ever met my husband's sister. I had tried several times to meet her before and she dodged every single one. She was very upset when we got engaged and even exclaimed to DH ""I've never even met her!"" to which DH said ""well you haven't really tried!"" because we dated for 2 years. SIL can only be described as personified Grumpy Cat because she is both extremely Millennial and also very negative. When she met me in-person she instantly did not like me, we all could tell, but the day before the wedding was already going so poorly that I simply didn't care. DH and SIL aren't close and her opinion meant very little to him.

Fast forward to the next day, we have the most hilariously failed wedding day of all time and to top it off SIL is wearing a white dress. To be fair, it wasn't fancy but it was still white and a dress. She didn't even wear a white dress to her OWN wedding (it was like a gold dress and it was gorgeous but it was not white). At that point, I had to pick my fights carefully and that one was just not it, so I let it slide. For years I let it simmer how upset it made me that she wore an all-white dress to my wedding. It was so rude and disrespectful and absolutely not one person called her out for it or attempted to stop her when she was getting dressed (she stayed with my MIL and FIL and I can't believe they didn't say anything because they're pretty textbook but they actually commented on how nice her dress was that day?!). 

Anyways, around Thanksgiving is also around my DH's grandma's birthday so they do a combo birthday celebration usually, and I wanted to get her a framed photo collage of all her grandkid's weddings (the last one happened this year) but the only hiccup is that all of our edited wedding pictures, done slightly spitefully, were professionally edited to make my SIL's dress light green (her favorite color). It honestly looks gorgeous and absolutely contrasts the picture more and you can't even tell it was edited. My photographer felt so bad about the whole fiasco of the day she did it free of charge and we only uploaded pictures of just us of a couple to our social media, so I thought it wouldn't hurt anyone. However, when doing the project I made it so every grandchild had a headshot of the couple and then the family shot underneath. Our wedding was about four years ago so I thought no one would honestly even care that much. When we opened gifts for Thanksgiving it got to my gift everyone ooo'd and awww'd and we immediately tried to find a place to hang it up. SIL came over and started looking at the pictures and looked at our wedding and became so upset, she stormed out of the room. Next thing you know her husband is pulling me to the side telling me we ""need to have a frank discussion"" about my actions and how deeply I hurt his wife. I say what? How? 

To make the most dramatic Thanksgiving quickly summed up, SIL was pissed I edited her dress because she bought that dress ""especially"" for her only brother's wedding, it made her feel stupid because everyone knew she wore white, etc. I told her she knew soooo much better than to wear a white dress to another person's wedding, it's disrespectful and rude. She asked me why I didn't bring it up before and I told her it wasn't worth the fight but it was worth the edit. She played victim for the rest of the evening, acting like I had personally ruined her entire Thanksgiving and then her family started saying I was being soft and should have kept her dress as is. My husband told them to be quiet and what she did was rude and we ended up leaving early.

I felt bad because it was so long ago and it felt petty but I felt like maybe it was petty to have even edited them to begin with or maybe I could have paid for someone to edit out the green and make the dress white again for just that one picture. AITA?"
z6rwsr_5082,z6rwsr,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"The day my husband and I got married was a total and complete disaster. We laugh at it now and find it to be just a funny day to tell the kids, but EVERYTHING that could have gone wrong did. As well, the day before the wedding was the first time I ever met my husband's sister. I had tried several times to meet her before and she dodged every single one. She was very upset when we got engaged and even exclaimed to DH ""I've never even met her!"" to which DH said ""well you haven't really tried!"" because we dated for 2 years. SIL can only be described as personified Grumpy Cat because she is both extremely Millennial and also very negative. When she met me in-person she instantly did not like me, we all could tell, but the day before the wedding was already going so poorly that I simply didn't care. DH and SIL aren't close and her opinion meant very little to him.

Fast forward to the next day, we have the most hilariously failed wedding day of all time and to top it off SIL is wearing a white dress. To be fair, it wasn't fancy but it was still white and a dress. She didn't even wear a white dress to her OWN wedding (it was like a gold dress and it was gorgeous but it was not white). At that point, I had to pick my fights carefully and that one was just not it, so I let it slide. For years I let it simmer how upset it made me that she wore an all-white dress to my wedding.

z70xhp_5087,z70xhp,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"so i’ve been working at my job now for three months now. it’s my first job ever and i feel as though my boss has created a toxic work environment, however i’m unsure because it’s my first job. a little over 3 months ago, my girlfriend(17F) got hired here. after that i applied to the same place so that maybe we could spend a little more time together, and so that i can save money to move out. i got hired into a different department than her.

so to be completely honest for the first like two weeks i was horrible at my job. basically all i do is take boxes of fruit and salads and such and put them out. i’m just a produce stocker. i felt that a lot of the times there wasn’t anything to stock, as the morning shift (i’m afternoon shift) will have already stocked everything we have and the things we needed we didn’t have in the cooler. part of this was due to my own lack of attention, and part of this was because of the lack of training i’ve received. another thing is that my girlfriend works in the bakery and every night she has to do the dishes and clean the floors all by herself. so since i thought i had nothing to do, i would go help her. however my boss, did not like this at all. which is fine, i completely understand why, i’ve since stopped helping her close and i’ve gotten much better at my job, i’m pretty much always busy.

now this is where i feel my boss has crossed some lines. we’re allowed to break together, there are no rules against this so obviously we break together every day. however about two weeks ago we went about 10 minutes over our break time on accident (we get 15 minute breaks, gone for about 25). when we left to get mcdonald’s (its right across the street literally a five minute walk) we saw our boss leaving to go home, aka already clocked out and everything. we waved to him, he waved back and smiled, everything was good. but after that while we were walking i kissed my girlfriends cheek. we’re fairly confident he saw, because he went back inside the store, timed us, and when we came back told us we were no longer allowed to break together. the both of us think that he did this because of the kiss. this is the only time we’ve gone over our break time.

that isn’t all either. at our job all the departments take out the trash to the same trash compactor. one time my boss took out her trash for her just so we wouldn’t interact with each other at the compactor. another time i walked by the bakery and ran into my boss and he then proceeded to grill me for like five minutes straight as to why i was walking past the bakery. i was going to the bathroom, i have to go past the bakery to get to the bathroom. he seems to be genuinely upset at the thought of me just looking at my own girlfriend 

i literally never pull this card but these past few months i’ve really felt that my boss treats us unfairly because we’re in a gay relationship. yes i understand that i have not been the best employee, but i have since improved and his treatment towards me and my girlfriend has not. he doesn’t treat anyone else like this, and there are multiple people who have break buddies as well. none of them are forbidden from breaking with each other. WIBTA if i reported my boss to HR?

edit: so i just wanna say that i made this post because i knew that my boss has reason already to dislike me because i’ve already screwed up a few times. but i also felt like i had reason to believe that he had an unfair opinion towards me. i should also mention that literally nobody at my job calls me by my preferred name either. i correct them every single single time and they always laugh, say ok, and continue to call me by the incorrect name. this was part of my reasoning for feeling like my boss may not be a huge fan of gay people. didn’t bring it up cause the post went over 3000 characters so i couldn’t post it. i know that i’m the asshole, i was late, i messed up. i thought that 2 months was long enough for him to let it go, but apparently not in corporate world. i think some of you need to remember that i’m 16, and this is my first job, i’m still figuring this out. i’ve had some people tell me that i’m never going to be successful, and that i’m never going to have a career because of this. you guys need to seriously take a step back and chill out. i’m going to continue to work with my girlfriend because she makes me happy, and we both enjoy however i am going to be more professional at work.

edit 2: i know i’m in the wrong but let just ask do any of you have friends at work? because by a lot of these replies you’re acting like you’re working absolutely 100% of the time and that you never slack off. i think a lot of you are seeing that this is my first job and almost putting yourself on a pedestal as you’ve likely been working an official job a lot longer than i have. get over yourself. i’m not a slave, and neither are you. i know you occasionally talk to your coworkers too. you can talk to your coworkers and still be professional and get your job done, stop acting like i can’t."

z76lb7_5094,z76lb7,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,"For some background I(23f) am friends with a girl who we are going to call F(21f), we met through my fiancé last year. She has best friends with his cousin since they were in school. She’s been seeing her boyfriend(22m) who we will call B on and off for seven years.

The relationship between F and B is very toxic, it has apparently affected every friendship she has. I became one of the only people she vents to about her relationship and at first I sugarcoated it because I tend to be more of a people pleaser but as months passed getting calls and messages every few days about B either ignoring her for days (he’s out of the country right now as he is in the military) or getting into awful screaming fights with her over his friendships with other girls that raise a red flag for F, it becomes a lot. So the last few weeks I’ve been saying my honest opinion without filters. She’s never expressed that my opinions or advice are a problem for her and almost always she brings it up.

From what she has told me they tend to work in a cycle where for weeks he will hardly call or text, or when she does get him on the phone he’s been quick to get off to go hang with his buddies. He’s been also maintaining a “work wife” sort of friendship that involves him going on double dates with their couple friend, spending the night at her house, spending holidays with her rather than contacting his civilian friends and family. This sort of behavior dates back to before she and I even met.

So last week during our usual chats B came up again because F genuinely believed he wouldn’t call for their anniversary. She told me if he didn’t call she was done which she has stated several times in the past and here we are. I told her I wouldn’t be surprised since he treats her like a side chick and encouraged her to stand up for herself if he didn’t go through with his promises. He did show up and I don’t know what happened after side from her telling him her friends don’t like how he treats her but she told me to check my Facebook because B said he messaged me on there ( I don’t use Facebook hardly). She wanted to know what he said because he’s never messaged any of her friends before

He sent a message that felt passive aggressive to me and I’ll admit I probably could have been more open-minded. He was asking for me to come to him if I had had suggestions for his relationship and I asked him if he was being passive aggressive. He responded he’s genuinely asking for advice. I told him right off the bat that I knew he didn’t want advice but that even so anything I could tell him would just be things his gf has repeatedly told him already so if he wants to know how to fix anything he needs to just listen to what she has to say.

The conversation that followed turned rather hostile on his part. To summarize 

-he demanded I give him actual advice or leave him alone. I reminded him that he messaged me and that the advice I’ve already given him was as good as it was going to get.
-After I said my advice (the part about him just listening to F when she communicates problems) initially his response was to call me manipulative, then when I asked him “who am I manipulating exactly?” he said “I know you are because you hyper-fixated on it”
-He said my advice that I was already giving to F was toxic and that I need to stop giving it to her because it’s pissing him off to which I responded that he cannot control my conversations and that if F wanted me to not give my opinion she can tell me herself. 
-I told him from just a short conversation he’s shown himself to be controlling, a gaslighter, and overall toxic and he responded by saying I was the one gaslighting him and F.
-Several times I told him the advice I already gave was all he would get to which he said “you’ve given me no criticisms or advice, you’ve just been defensive right off the bat

Those are just the highlights but I’ll say I never resorted to insults before telling you the next part, just observations from our conversation. I didn’t bring up anything I knew about their relationship to throw in his face because he’s already told her before to stop telling people about their fights and I worried about telling him what all she told me would backfire on her. I called him controlling, told him he was a gaslighter and disrespectful, that was about as heated as my responses were. Most of my responses were just repeating that I cannot nor would not do anything for him further than telling him to just listen to F. I told him right off the bat I didn’t believe his intentions for messaging me were pure and my gut was right because who asks someone for advice when you believe they’ve been giving your gf toxic advice? 

So the juicy part (I know, it gets worse), he then began using Facebook information to try and scare me. Just pointing out small details like the date that I announced my engagement, whatever. He asked me if he intimidated me and I told him no and returned the conversation back to “listen to your gf”. Then he sent me these lovely messages (unprompted because I wasn’t about to bring military into it, not my place and I don’t know too terribly much about it other than what my veteran grandpa [He was in Vietnam] has told us)

“You assume a lot. That’s what gets people in my profession killed.”

“It’s a good thing I serve and protect the citizens. Don’t become a communist though, I have no mercy for them.”

“Anyway you can take the moral high ground I don’t care, but if you accuse me of cheating, not caring about her or even a whisper that I’m no good for you I’ll have a very stern talking to with you” to this I asked if that was supposed to be a threat to which he replied “BAM winner, I know you would say that but no it’s not a threat for legal reasons”

My fiancé served in the military and was understandably upset by the whole thing and so he typed out a tidbit about how using his uniform to try and intimidate me was disrespectful. Never called him names, never got hostile. This sent B into a rage because he accused me of being anti-military and disrespecting his brothers and sisters in arm, saying that he wouldn’t put up with it. I responded that I have respect for the uniform, just not the person wearing it that is currently messaging me. Then the conversation ended there after he continued calling me names and told me to fuck off.

I sent the screenshots to F, he’d already done so. I assume he’s telling her that I’m trying to manipulate her into dumping him as he’d made it pretty clear to me that he believed that’s what I was doing. She defended him saying that he was genuinely asking for advice and didn’t mean anything he said as a threat. Told me she was overwhelmed and stressed and would be taking a break from all relationships including our friendship because she just doesn’t know what to think.

So basically AITA for going with my gut and not playing along with his request for advice?"

His mother has lived with us basically the entire time. Over the years she always spirals into being nasty to me and starting drama. She is physically not incapable but has mental illnesses due to prior drug use. She will, every few months, stop taking her meds and I can always tell. She makes rude remarks, sits and watches me clean with an evil stare and eventually it spirals into screaming matches and her calling me foul names. Besides this, She also inserts herself into my and my fiancé’s arguments and when things are heated I can hear them talking about me. I have told my fiancé countless times that it’s not fair for me to have no privacy in my own home and to be ganged up on and he’s said before that he will figure something out but it never ends up happening. He said that he would blame me if something happened to her while she was living somewhere else which I think is unfair. The only reason I agreed to live with her in the first place was because he “didn’t think she had much longer” and I didn’t think it would come to her treating me the way she does. She is healthy enough to live on her own. She just doesn’t want to. I don’t think it’s fair to me continue living with her and constantly feeling like I don’t have a home or safe place. And I don’t think it’s healthy for my fiancé to live with her either because it’s keeping him from growing emotionally and its effected our relationship. We don’t fight often but it has become more frequent and a few days ago I ended things because I’m unhappy with our living situation and am sick of feeling like my feelings and sense of peace aren’t important.

The only reason I agreed to live with her in the first place was because he “didn’t think she had much longer” and I didn’t think it would come to her treating me the way she does. She is healthy enough to live on her own. She just doesn’t want to. I don’t think it’s fair to me continue living with her and constantly feeling like I don’t have a home or safe place. And I don’t think it’s healthy for my fiancé to live with her either because it’s keeping him from growing emotionally and its effected our relationship. We don’t fight often but it has become more frequent and a few days ago I ended things because I’m unhappy with our living situation and am sick of feeling like my feelings and sense of peace aren’t important. AITA for this?"

AITA for refusing to give her more money

He understandably hates it. Recently we have been working together more and more and I’ve realized that he feminizes his voice when interacting with customers. 
This isn’t a normal customer service voice either, I mean at least 2 octaves higher added to his voice that is decently high already. 
At the store we work at we have a few trans employees and they have an additional label on their name tags with their preferred pronouns. His label has been removed and when I asked he said that he did it. I didn’t ask why and just thought it was weird but after 3 days of working with him straight and hearing the amount of people that referred to him with she/her pronouns it was starting to make him mad. 
So while we were closing I asked him why he removed his pronoun label knowing that he appears as a girl. Basically asking why he was mad/annoyed people were calling him a girl when he removed the one thing that told people otherwise. It also doesn’t help that he wears a lot of pink because of the random love for strawberry themed things. 
I also asked why he heightens his voice so much, making the chances of him being misgendered more frequent. He didn’t say anything for a minute and then just told me that it was the most disrespectful thing he’s ever been asked and walked away from me.

z7yifm_5130,z7yifm,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"My brother has severe developmental disabilities so he can’t do anything on his own including eating, bathing, using the bathroom, and he cannot communicate verbally. My parents recently lost their assistance with care, and they are not in the best physical health so this is really hard for them. My parents have spent their entire adult lives putting my brother first and neglecting themselves and it’s caught up to them, along with old age. They are now full time care takers and don’t get a break. 

I’ve been asked to fly back to my home state and help out. Here’s where the problem lies. My dad was abusive my entire childhood and I have a lot of trauma in that home. I also have a psychoactive disorder that gets really bad when I visit. I can handle my disorder if I maintain my routine and my environment at my house, even vacations are difficult for me. The last time I went to help out I went into one of the worst depressive episodes of my life and it took almost a month to get back to “normal”. My dad is trying to be better now, but he still has his moments of anger and it sends me into a spiral to be with him too long. 

On top of that, I grew up trying to deal with the difficulties that come with having a special needs sibling. Nobody ever talks about how hard it is on the other kids in the family. My mom did her best, but I had to step up from an early age. I don’t want to have kids because I’ve seen what having a disabled child does to a family. The sleepless nights from seizures, always having your head on a swivel, the screaming because that’s the only way he can communicate. I know that this sounds incredibly selfish, but I don’t want to be stuck being a care taker. I finally get to take care of myself for the first time in my life and I don’t want to give that up, even temporarily. 

I want to be there for my mom and my brother, and I want to be a good daughter. I’m so torn between prioritizing my mental health and stability and contributing to my family. So AITA for wanting to say no to my parents?"

I'll try to keep this short.

My roommate's birthday was this past weekend. We all agreed to host a while ago and it was a small gathering (10 people).

When her birthday rolled around, I just wasn't in a great mood. I stuck it out for a while but around midnight I got really tired and decided I wanted to go to bed. I told my other roommates that they had to kick the guests out because I wanted to sleep (they ended up leaving around 12:45 am). We never discussed the exact time the party would end, I just didn't expect it to go that late. Our apartment is small so they had to leave in order for me to sleep because our rooms are all right off of the main room. 

People are calling me an AH because even though it was late, the birthday girl (my roommate) was having a good time and I should've just stuck it out and not made everyone leave. They're saying the birthday girl should've been the only one who could say when it was over.

For info: party started at 9:30pm

 My birthday is in a couple weeks and I asked him if he had made plans or had plans to make plans. He said and asked if there was something specific I wanted to do. I said yes and made reservations to one of my favorite restaurants. I even arranged for my oldest to babysit the youngest so it could just be me and the hubs. 

The other day my brother texts and ask if I want to watch a football game. It's the same day as the birthday reservations so I told him no and that's hubs and I had plans for my birthday. I thought would be the end of it but my husband okayed my brother and his entire family (wife and four kids) to come over to our house to watch the game and celebrate my birthday.

I told my husband that this is not how I want to spend my birthday. I want to relax and take my time getting ready for dinner. I also know my husband has a tendency to drink a lot with my brother. As the game is a rival game (both myself and brother were military but different branches) my brother won't be nice and make comments no matter who wins the game.

My husband has told me that brother and SIL are taking care of food, will be gone before we have to leave for dinner, and everyone just wants to be around me for the birthday.

I honestly don't believe this as it is opposite of how my brother has ever behaved. The last thing he planned to do for me was my gender reveal and he forgot to invite people, get decorations, or order food. He only brought the colored smoke for us to find out our youngest gender. I ended up planning the entire thing last minute although he took the credit. 

I told my husband I refuse to get anything or plan for this to happen as it's beyond messed up for me to plan something I don't want. Would I be TA if I just skipped it completely and did something else just for me on my birthday?"

He was clearly upset and against it. I stated that I feel anyone should be able to wear any hairstyle and that a certain hairstyle shouldn't be gatekeeped by one race. Everyone in the group chat disagreed and tried explaining why it was NOT ok. I told them it's just like acrylic nails being from China, and them loving that we love them. Or how Wigs originated from Egyptians and they have no problem with anyone wearing what they came up with. My other friend, Alex told me that's completely different.  Which I disagree with.

In the end, everyone left the group chat, one friend un added me, and I got ignored for around 2 weeks. Someone please put me in my place if I'm wrong. Please ask questions if you feel I missed any info!


Edit: I wanna follow up my post from yesterday.  I've read all of your responses and replied to most. A bunch of you said ""NTA"" and I'm thankful for you guys, but to the handful or more that said I was TA, thank you for educating me on the situation!! All of your opinions are valid and heard! 

In part of this thread, I read one calling me ignorant and saying I turned to reddit before educating myself so you guys would hold my hand. Though it may have seemed by the way I worded my post that I wanted everyone to back me up, that couldn't be further from the truth. Replying to that comment, a redditor explained that I was looking for more education on the matter, and this opened more people up to understand the rights and wrongs about this situation. 

My memory isn't the best, so I can't quote word for word, but another redditor wrote not picking sides, but as a bystander/middle ground in this. She said how she as a white girl had curly hair and always saw others of all colors with curly hair beautiful. She said it made her tear up to find out darker men &amp; women were discriminated against in modern time due to their natural hair. 

What I'm trying to get at here is that in the heat of the moment, I didn't think about the way I said things or seeing the situation from the other end of it. I was frustrated that people were arguing over wearing certain hairstyles. Yeah, maybe white girls shouldn't wear box braids cause it fucks up our hair MAJORLY, but it's anyone's choice how they style their hair! 

I don't want any bad blood between anyone here, but I see this situation now as a learning experience for both myself and other readers!"

Edit: I wanna follow up my post from yesterday.  I've read all of your responses and replied to most. A bunch of you said ""NTA"" and I'm thankful for you guys, but to the handful or more that said I was TA, thank you for educating me on the situation!! All of your opinions are valid and heard! 

In part of this thread, I read one calling me ignorant and saying I turned to reddit before educating myself so you guys would hold my hand. Though it may have seemed by the way I worded my post that I wanted everyone to back me up, that couldn't be further from the truth. Replying to that comment, a redditor explained that I was looking for more education on the matter, and this opened more people up to understand the rights and wrongs about this situation. 

My memory isn't the best, so I can't quote word for word, but another redditor wrote not picking sides, but as a bystander/middle ground in this. She said how she as a white girl had curly hair and always saw others of all colors with curly hair beautiful. She said it made her tear up to find out darker men &amp; women were discriminated against in modern time due to their natural hair. 

What I'm trying to get at here is that in the heat of the moment, I didn't think about the way I said things or seeing the situation from the other end of it. I was frustrated that people were arguing over wearing certain hairstyles. Yeah, maybe white girls shouldn't wear box braids cause it fucks up our hair MAJORLY, but it's anyone's choice how they style their hair! 

I don't want any bad blood between anyone here, but I see this situation now as a learning experience for both myself and other readers!"

z97ym8_5203,z97ym8,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"I’m 25F and newly married to my equally baffled husband (27M). My family and friends know I use this sub and ask me “what I’ve seen” all the time. They love this stuff, so this is kinda surreal.

The  crazy stuff started at the rehearsal dinner a few weeks ago, which my  Maid of Honor decided was the perfect time to announce that she was  pregnant with twins. I told her “This is our occasion, please don’t  steal from us” and she insisted anyway, since not everything has to  revolve around me, and at least she did it at the rehearsal and not the reception. Turns out that she’s just pregnant with one baby and that the twins thing was a lie, probably to garner attention. After silently  loathing her all of my wedding day, I’m not speaking to her.

It got even worse at my wedding. For the unaware, it’s customary after the couple’s first dance for a bride + her father and a groom + his mother to dance. Well right after this, my MIL of all people did a  gender-reversal proposal to her boyfriend of 1 year (my hubby’s father  died in an accident 4 years ago) with everybody watching. Someone took a picture of my livid face and my husband's panic. He told me later he didn’t like this either, and it makes no sense to either of us since  she’s very conservative.

Thanksgiving at my in-laws was very hostile. It felt like when I wanted to join a conversation, it would shift subjects, and they were dismissive of everything I said, even about my own honeymoon which I'd just gotten back from. I felt unwelcome. Husband told me MIL said it was because I  was wearing a hat, but I know that’s an excuse. I texted her because of this (bad hair days happen!) and what happened at the wedding, I have no intention of having any relationship with her.

A  fourth incident occurred the other day, when my single mother cousin, who was a bridesmaid too, was at my door without warning asking if my husband and I could watch the kid. We’re not equipped to do that and she didn’t provide us with a changing table or anything, and we had work to do (I work from home, my husband works a 1 to 9 shift), so we said no. This made her mad. She posted to Snap that “Some people really should be  better friends” and at that point, I’d had enough.

I replied to her “Well if YOU asked ahead of time, and YOU had given us  the equipment, maybe YOU would be a better friend.” She sent a series of  vicious messages, followed by other cousins and friends trashing me  just the same. I got called out for being “a cold b\*\*\*h” for making  literally everything about me. I posted to Facebook, what my older relatives and in-laws use, “Literally ALL of these incidents happen in AITA posts. WHY ARE YOU ALL CONSPIRING AGAINST ME? You’re all awful! Is this why you keep asking what happens there?” This of course got me more replies saying that I only ever think about myself, including MIL calling me a b\*\*\*h too, and a bunch of denials. I can’t help but think me making all of these incidents about me as the common denominator. AITA?"

The past few days I have been barely been able to get out of bed, I feel so weak I can barely walk. My husband’s excuse for not being able to help is “he is working” (he works from home). Am I expecting too much for him to take a sick day and help out? 

I mentioned to him that I should probably go to the doctor since it’s been more than a few daysand I am not getting better (our baby is showing no symptoms of being sick) 
He scoffed and said “Why? You are fine”. 

Before I got sick he wouldn’t help out with the baby at all either saying “your on leave, I’m working”. And when he would be done with work all he does is play video games or leaves the house to go play rec games 2x a week. I told him I can’t take care of the baby and be the only one to do everything around the house. I haven’t been taking care of myself, he notices that. He gets mad at me and yells at me saying I need to take care of myself so I can take care of the baby. I can’t make myself food though because the baby has to be held. If I put the baby down and try and make something for myself he comes in the room, scoops up the baby all passive aggressive. Or if I ask him to make me dinner his excuse is always related to video games and how he is playing “1 more game” and next thing you know it’s 2 hours later and I am in bed. 

AITA for “expecting too much”? He makes me feel like I cannot ask for help from him.

I just feel like I am a single parent, and everything was the complete opposite during my pregnancy. He was amazing."

Tonight he was over and we were watching a movie and just talking and he made a comment about how when he was in the military that when he first became part of the infantry unit that women were not allowed to be in it and when he was leaving the military is when women were allowed to join. He made the comment that women shouldn’t be in combat because “we can’t made sound decisions during our period” and continued in saying that women shouldn’t be doing certain jobs because we can’t “lift” as much as a man. Like I understand that we may not be able to lift as much but that doesn’t mean we aren’t qualified to do the job considering plenty of guys do partner lifts. 

So AITA for being upset and potentially not wanting to see him again because of those comments?"
z9nms9_5224,z9nms9,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"This is a throwaway account as I have family and friends linked to my main account.

I 28M, and my wife 25F have had an overall good marriage (other than a few small fights). We have been married for 5 years and together for 7. Recently, my family has come to a disagreement about this situation so I thought I’d post it here and get some non-bias opinions.

Last weekend, my brother 30M and his girlfriend 29F were having their baby shower/gender reveal. They’ve been together for 6 years and have broken up a few times due to my brother having anger issues but they always sorted it out. Me and my wife were both invited to the baby shower but my wife was surprisingly hesitant to go. I waved this off as she had recently suffered a miscarriage (although we have 2 healthy kids) and I thought she was just upset about all the baby related stuff.

Eventually, after speaking to her she agreed to go. I’d like to add that my brother was the one that introduced me to my wife as they were colleagues when they worked a part time job together.

So at 2pm we drove half an hour to attend and everything seemed to be going well. There was always some sort of tension between my wife and my brother’s girlfriend, but I never thought anything of it as my wife and my brother are still close friends.

About half way through, I noticed my wife was on her phone a lot and so was my brother and stealing glances at each other. I thought they were maybe planning a surprise for my brothers girlfriend so I asked my wife what she was doing. She was surprisingly dismissive (she has never been secretive about her phone or her passwords) so I just left it.

About 10 minutes later, my wife tells me she’s going inside to go to the bathroom and my brother tells his wife he’s going to get more drinks for the guests. I start speaking to my cousin and note my wife’s strange behaviour.

After 30 minutes of my wife not coming back out, I started to get worried so I went to check on her. I obviously look in the bathroom first and find it’s empty. I then look in the kitchen thinking she might be helping my brother with the drinks but they’re both nowhere to be seen. I started to get a bad feeling about this so I searched the whole house and when I got to my brother’s bedroom the door was locked but I heard my wife’s voice so out of anger, I broke down the door (for reference I am 6’2 and go to the gym 5 times a week) there, I find my overweight brother on top of my beautiful wife. I thought he was trying to suffocate her (no offence but hes 5’3 and 20 stone) and I pulled him off of her. I then realised that they were both naked and about to have sex. I punched that fat cunt in the gob and stormed out the room.

I was blinded with rage, I stomped out to the baby shower and announced to everyone what they were doing. His girlfriend started sobbing uncontrollably and I heard my wife and brother coming outside and I started shouting at them both while everyone was watching. Here is where I might be the asshole, while I was shouting at them, I pointed out how my brother can’t even afford a baby because he’s too obese to work a proper job and his girlfriend deserves better. My wife was also sobbing and apologising and out of anger I called her a bitch and a whore. I went into my car (I drove me and my wife to the house so she had no way of getting back other than uber) and I paid the babysitter and started thinking about my next steps. My wife came back in an uber and we aren’t on speaking terms as I’m upset with her for cheating and she’s upset with me for calling her a bitch. She’s sleeping in the guest bedroom and mainly taking care of the kids (she doesn’t work and I take care of bills).

I’m getting a lot of backlash on facebook from friends and family saying I escalated the situation and saying I could’ve handled it better. The only people agreeing with me are my in-laws (my wife’s parents) and my cousin that was also at the baby shower. I’m writing this to get all my thoughts down and get myself together and maybe get some advice on this situation.

Should I divorce? Do I go to couples therapy?  Should I cut off my family? What about the kids?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

We even lived together for about a month or so. Everything was really good for quite some time. Then the day after the semester ended in May, “J” sent us both a message that essentially told us she needed a break from us and that she was done. We both asked why and weren’t really given an answer. A month goes by and J has surgery. I check in on her. We were both blocked on everything besides Instagram. My message gets ignored. At some point I ask for my missing things back and she blows up at me. Fast forward about 6 weeks later to July. I get a call from title 9 at work saying J has filed a no contact order against me. My fiancé is upset at J and is on my side. The rest of the summer we were on the same page and hurt by J’s actions. Fast forward to September when the semester starts… J wants to talk to my fiancé. IN TWENTY MINUTES THEY MAKE UP AND ARE FRIENDS AGAIN!! I was so hurt. I went through days of crying and begging my fiancé to reconsider making up with her so easily and just forgetting everything that happened. My fiancé got an “answer” from J for the NCO and it was “for my mental health”. I wasn’t happy with that answer cuz it felt like a load of BS. So fast forward again. It’s now December. My fiancé has been talking to and spending time with J and ignoring how upset I am that they’re friends. She says she should be allowed to be friends with whoever she wants to be. But it’s a school restraining order that applies until 2025…it’s just so hurtful that my fiancé is basically choosing this girl over me who she’s supposed to have a life with."

z9ti5q_5236,z9ti5q,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"So I have a sister who left an abusive relationship with her infant (less than a year old) daughter around August.
To sum it up he would hit her, push her down stairs, scream at her and even let her take the fall for having drugs in the car (which he then got angry at her for taking a plea deal to keep her from going to jail). 
His mom helped him keep her locked in the house and even refused to give anyone an address to come get her or to send police to help her leave. (she's just as bad in my opinion) 
CPS has been involved since she gave birth (my sister had drugs in her system) they told my sister if she went back to him they'd remove the baby from her custody. 
Well two days ago she had his mom pick her up from 2 hours away and take her down to her house. 
She also texted my dad saying she was going back to her ex and dropping the restraining order. I sent her messages (that went unanswered) telling her if she didn't get back to where she was safe with the baby I'd call CPS (mind you I don't agree with CPS a lot, I hate them due to me thinking they're trafficking kids, but I felt that was my only option) 
She refused to answer, so ..I called them and they came to his mom's house the next morning. 
She told my ex best friend that I didn't love her or the baby because I called cps. 
Then today she went and completely dropped the restraining order on her ex and her reasoning.

""If I'm stuck down here close to him what's the point in having it"" 
(You'd think being closer to him would mean she needs it more) 
My whole family agrees with what I did, my husband said I did the right thing to try and keep the baby safe. I know I ruined my relationship with my sister but I've told all my siblings I would if it meant keeping my nieces and nephews lives safe...

z9wdnu_5243,z9wdnu,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"So here is the situation.  My son met a girl who had a child already.  They got married and had 2 kids.  Then wife cheated on my son, dumped him, and married another dude, had a kid with that dude.

THEN, she and my son cheated on her husband and she got pregnant , dumped her husband and she and my son had a 3rd kid together.  THEN  she dumped my son again and they have remained apart.

I have no relationship with any of the kids other than the 2 he had with her the first time.  I have not even met the younger 2,(one is his, one is not his).   Her son that she had before they got together, i have obviously met, but we have no relationship.   Both of the boys who are not my son's children have fairly wealthy and involved fathers and grandparents.   one of them even gets to go to disney once a year with is dad and the others dont. Both fathers and their families really load up those boys at xmas.

Now xmas is coming, and it been a really bad year financially for my husband and I.  Basically,  I dont want to buy xmas gifts for the 2 that are not my son's kids.   If  my son and their mother were together, i would consider them my grandkids,  EVEN though i dont really know them.

SO...  AITAH  for not wanting to consider them grandchildren and  not want to give them gift?  or should i just suck it up and buy them gifts?  I will note that i have provided xmas and birthday gifts for the past several years and have NEVER received a thank your or any type of acknowledgement  that they had received them.  I do not speak to their mother at all.

Edit:  I appreciate everyones feedback.  after talking with my son, who totally understands my viewpoint, i will be getting something for those two kids, because my sons says his ex  is so vindictive that she will be extra shitty and might not let him take the older two this summer if i dont.  I am trying to think of one big gift, but their ages are so spread out....16,  11, 10, 5 and 1.     "
z9wdnu_5245,z9wdnu,top-comment,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,"So here is the situation.  My son met a girl who had a child already.  They got married and had 2 kids.  Then wife cheated on my son, dumped him, and married another dude, had a kid with that dude.

THEN, she and my son cheated on her husband and she got pregnant , dumped her husband and she and my son had a 3rd kid together.  THEN  she dumped my son again and they have remained apart.

I have no relationship with any of the kids other than the 2 he had with her the first time.  I have not even met the younger 2,(one is his, one is not his).   Her son that she had before they got together, i have obviously met, but we have no relationship.   Both of the boys who are not my son's children have fairly wealthy and involved fathers and grandparents.   one of them even gets to go to disney once a year with is dad and the others dont. Both fathers and their families really load up those boys at xmas.

This year I told him I wanted to do something special but he didn’t give me any ideas so I book a couple reservations so he could pick one. I even took off work:( Today is his birthday and he just left to hang out with his friend and said he wouldn’t make dinner :-/. I texted him saying I am a little hurt ur not letting me give u something nice on your birthday and he said he is just never going to tell me when he is going to hang out with friends because it ruins everything. And for context I was invited for a family thing they did a couple of days back but he had them schedule it when I was working. I know it’s his birthday but I am feeling a little sad and left out and disappointed I wasn’t able to do something special with him and he didn’t want to do anything with me.

za6gll_5263,za6gll,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Just a little context to set the scene. I live and work in a ski town. I am by no means a member of the upper eschelon here but have lived and worked in the service industry here and at other resorts for the past 25 years, so I’m well aware of the tourist and part-time resident shenanigans that occur on a regular basis. The account I just had is nothing new but my attitude toward it has changed so much over the past few years, as everyone seems to be in such new and improved rare form lately, that I simply refuse to hold back anymore. Today was the first time I felt zero guilt for cussing at a stranger, which makes me wonder, AITAH? 

So, I got off of work at 5pm and needed a couple of things from the store. There is a market by my work and considering I did not feel like going out of my way to one of the big box stores at prime time, I just ran into the over-priced market as I needed literally 2 things. There were 2 lanes open, both with people who had carts overflowing waiting to be checked out. I stood behind one lady for about 5 minutes before another cashier was called over. She looked at me and told me she could check me out so I walked over. Before I made it the 4 steps to get there, some entitled little blonde bitch jumps in front of me. She actually looked at me and smiled as the cashier started to ring her up. I looked her deadass in the eyes and said, “That was fucking rude.” Her eyes got big behind her school-teacher glasses and she goes, “But, but…she was already ringing me up!” I just replied, still maintaining deadass stare, “You even smiled at me as you cut me off…” (disgusted eyeroll and head shake of shame included)

I know I was not the asshole in my reaction but I feel absolutely zero remorse. Once I calmed down, I actually felt a little pride in having said something. Is that bad? Or is it simply a part of getting older and not giving a single fuck what anyone else thinks anymore?"

zad3p8_5270,zad3p8,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"So, my cousin has granddaughters, particularly spoiled... And they are the (anti) social media types.

On Thanksgiving she was uploading a test/prank video of her husband where she asked him if he would rather kiss her for $100 or the most beautiful girl in the world for $1,000.

Looking straight at his 2 year old daughter he said the most beautiful girl in the world. When she pouted he said his daughter was the most beautiful girl and she needed to get off TicTok and join in on the family stuff.

She blew up! Slapped him several times, when the 2 year old went to daddy she slapped the daughter twice... On her own live stream...

And these weren't little slaps, she hit a 2 year old in the head twice as hard as she could before family got it stopped.

He got on her media account, copied the video.

On Friday he filed a police report with her video and got a TRO, on Monday he got a restraining order rolling, she freaked out and started destroying the house, which he got on video when she got served.

This week he field for separation, full emergency custody, and locked the restraining order down.
This was REALLY fast where I live, way faster than I expected.

My cousin/his wife are waffling, her parents are solidly on her side, so are her spoiled rotten sisters and their ""On Line"" friends, so a crap show...

I'm team husband 100%. So much so my wife and I have offered SAFE child care and recommended a good divorce lawyer. He works 9-10 hour days, we have child care at my company...

The police got CPS involved. (Mandated reporters, had no choice in the matter) and the crazy train has left the station! 

100s of messages, phone calls, threats, begging, all kinds of crap since he lives on my property they think I'm supposed to rug sweep a full grown adult smacking a 2 year old in her little soft head... and the ONLY way they could have got my phone number and email was the abusive mom... 

And I'm NOT that kind of guy simply won't happen. The child is 100% my concern, I saw the incident with my own two eyes, and in no world was it acceptable or justified in any way. Just an outburst from an unhinged person... She's an adult, not a toddler.

I suggested intense (like in-patient) anger management and therapy, but that brought more insults of ME/WIFE being ""Crazy""... Isn't blame shifting a wonderful thing?

I've been a child advocate to the courts before, I offered it again, and that got them to blow up more. Right now he's not waffling, divorce is imminent if she doesn't get serious counseling, and I hope it stays that way... 

Keep in mind I've known this young man since he was in diapers, I have no reservations recommending him to anyone, and just because he's ""Not Blood"" doesn't make him any less the child's father."

zak08s_5285,zak08s,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Bit of backstory, I (23 F) and my best friend (22 M) have been friends for a couple of years now. We are very close and do a lot of things together such a travelling and going out for bfast/lunch/dinner etc. My friend caught feelings for me quite a while ago and has found it hard to move on 
Things In the past have happened between us in the bedroom which I know is not me helping how he feels, but they just happened. There has been many times where I have told him it can’t happen anymore but he always sends massive paragraphs about how he doesn’t mind us not being in a relationship and he’s happy for us to just meet each other’s needs, so I used to go along with it to keep him from getting angry at me or losing him as a friend

He has recently been away travelling for two months and he came back for a family party after two weeks, where again, things happened. At this time he has been away for 6 weeks and proposed the idea of us being official fwb when he gets back. I declined and said from experience, his feelings get in the way and it’s just not what I want to to be doing anymore. He has found himself on this trip and I have also found myself while he has been away ( went through a breakup start of this year and only starting to get over things) .As usual, he went off on one saying it’s not fair on him, he just wants us to use each other for needs to be met and I understand that sometimes it messes with his head, but this isn’t what I wanted. I declined his offer and he wasn’t happy and couldn’t accept me saying no thank you. I feel backed into a corner because he gets back in a weeks time and I don’t want to lose him as a friend if I don’t agree to this 

So AITA for not agreeing to be friends with benefits even though things have happened in the past?


Edit: I appreciate everyone’s feedback so far. Things obviously don’t ‘accidentally happen’ and that’s not what I meant by this post at all. Most of the time things have happened I have been drinking and that’s what I mean by it. There have been times where I’ve been sober and I am well aware that in that situation I am not helping either one of us. That being said, this is all in the past and I feel like I should be able to change my mind about not wanting to sleep with him anymore."

I (19M) and my girlfriend (20F) have been together for 5 years, over the past few moths she has been low on income and struggling and has been thinking of starting an OnlyFans account. I was never really a fan of this and she reassured me that she wasn't going to do it without my permission first and she would only post feet pics.

She recently got very deep into her savings is starting to not be able to afford her phone bill, car loan etc. I offered to send her $100 from my paycheque every week until she gets back on her feet which she accepted. A couple days ago I received a text from her telling me that she has opened her OnlyFans account along with promotional Twitter and Instagram accounts which shocked me however I kept my cool and asked her to show me. She refused at first and then reluctantly sent me the link, she kept her word of only having feet pictures but the comments on the photos made me feel sick to my core.

I tried supporting her but she asked me not to look at it because it was embarrassing, I agreed and let it go for a few days. My curiosity got the best of me and I looked at what she had posted but she had me blocked. I confronted her about this saying ""Hey can you unblock me as it's really hard for me to support what you're doing when I cant see what you're posting"" she refused and I told her I'm unsure if I can continue to date her if she doesn't unblock me as it adds to my uncomfortableness.

We fought and she deleted it calling me manipulative, insecure along with other names. She says no matter what I was to say it would be shitty. So AITA?"

She asked what I thought she should do. I said she should get her to talk to someone right away and not delay it. She then said she was EMBARRASSED to have to tell her boss she needed to leave work to take her daughter to seek help. I lost it. I yelled at her saying as someone who has suffered from depression that saying that in front of her daughter is disrespectful and ignorant. She then hung up on me and blocked me on everything.

I (14F) live between my mom’s house and my dad’s house. I’m with my mom most of the time, and I have 3 siblings but only one is relevant to this story. 
When I am at my dad’s house I don’t have these issues, but when I’m at my mom’s house, one of my siblings, typically the youngest (6F) will start screaming mostly out of nowhere. Now, you might tell me to just go to a different part of the house, or even go outside but the thing is, my sister is **LOUD**. One time I was walking to a friend’s house and I heard the start of her screaming fit from down the block. 
Now, my mom will tune out my sister’s screaming fits and just “leave her to calm herself down” but I will be in my room across the house with my TV on and my headphones in and I will still hear her screaming. I let the screaming go on for a bit (you’ll see why in a bit)and after a while I go and tell her “hey stop screaming” but sometimes she’ll just scream over me or yell “STOP TALKING” in my face. Here’s where I think I may be the AH. At this point I will yell over my sister screaming because I can’t handle loud noises like screaming for long (sensory issue, my mom is aware). At this point my mom will come out of her room (which always seems to be locked so I can’t ask my mom for help) and yell at me for 1. yelling and 2. not letting my mom be the parent. She then will send me to my room and not tell my sister to stop screaming, which my sister sees and then she thinks that she is right because I got in trouble and she didn’t. I have tried talking to my sister and my mom, but there is no change. So, I want to stop doing my chores because I can’t work under poor conditions. So, WIBTAH?

UPDATE: hoo boy

so, this happened again. my mom was out of the house and the usual thing happened over the phone, but this time i asked my dad to pick me up and i went for a walk. he ended up not being able to because he was busy and it’s technically my mom’s custody day BUT this big burst let to a serious heart to heart with my mom where we shared our points of view and we confronted trauma from the past. some more context that i lacked: 
1. when she’s locked in her room, she is in a meeting
2. when she is out of the house, she is trying to get stuff for one of my siblings or me
also, apparently she can tell the difference between pain screams and annoyance screams which she actually demonstrated earlier today so it’s not as much as a problem when she’s in her room.

I (14F) live between my mom’s house and my dad’s house. I’m with my mom most of the time, and I have 3 siblings but only one is relevant to this story. 
When I am at my dad’s house I don’t have these issues, but when I’m at my mom’s house, one of my siblings, typically the youngest (6F) will start screaming mostly out of nowhere. Now, you might tell me to just go to a different part of the house, or even go outside but the thing is, my sister is **LOUD**. One time I was walking to a friend’s house and I heard the start of her screaming fit from down the block. 
Now, my mom will tune out my sister’s screaming fits and just “leave her to calm herself down” but I will be in my room across the house with my TV on and my headphones in and I will still hear her screaming. I let the screaming go on for a bit (you’ll see why in a bit)and after a while I go and tell her “hey stop screaming” but sometimes she’ll just scream over me or yell “STOP TALKING” in my face. Here’s where I think I may be the AH. At this point I will yell over my sister screaming because I can’t handle loud noises like screaming for long (sensory issue, my mom is aware). At this point my mom will come out of her room (which always seems to be locked so I can’t ask my mom for help) and yell at me for 1. yelling and 2. not letting my mom be the parent. She then will send me to my room and not tell my sister to stop screaming, which my sister sees and then she thinks that she is right because I got in trouble and she didn’t. I have tried talking to my sister and my mom, but there is no change. So, I want to stop doing my chores because I can’t work under poor conditions. So, WIBTAH?

UPDATE: hoo boy

so, this happened again. my mom was out of the house and the usual thing happened over the phone, but this time i asked my dad to pick me up and i went for a walk. he ended up not being able to because he was busy and it’s technically my mom’s custody day BUT this big burst let to a serious heart to heart with my mom where we shared our points of view and we confronted trauma from the past. some more context that i lacked: 
1. when she’s locked in her room, she is in a meeting
2. when she is out of the house, she is trying to get stuff for one of my siblings or me
also, apparently she can tell the difference between pain screams and annoyance screams which she actually demonstrated earlier today so it’s not as much as a problem when she’s in her room.

We have them on a regular basis. I have my own children 16 &amp; 14 who live with us. All the children get along really well. We have alternate weekends with the children, so one weekend with all four and the next weekend with none. From the start I have stipulated that I am not comfortable looking after the 4year old on my own during the day. I don’t mind the 12year old so much as by that age, like my own kids they are self sufficient, sort themselves out and need little or no help from me. However, my partner has always had time off work or worked nights so the little one has been in bed while he’s at work which after several months I compromised to looking after them then as they are asleep. My partner has a new job now where he will be working 12hour shifts (meaning he’ll be out 6am-8pm including travel, so won’t see the 4yo at all) His shift pattern means that some weekends he will be working the whole weekend. It is on these weekends(It’ll be once in every couple of months where it falls when his children are due to visit) I have said that I will not look after his children. Not for any particular reasons, they are not naughty or anything, but I feel I’ve been there and done that with my own children and previous step children. I don’t want to spend my time looking after little children, and quite frankly I don’t think I’d have the patience to deal with a four year old all day in my own and i don’t want to start resenting the child and dread themComing which I know I would do if I was forced to look after them. I know it sounds very selfish, and past experience and relationships have made me that way. It’s self preservation of me and my mental health. after years of being in an abusive relationship and being told what I can and cannot do, being nothing but a mum and housewife, I enjoy my free and child free time away from my own children (we have alternate weekends with all four children and no children) and I refuse to give that up. I work hard Monday to Friday and need my time to relax and recharge over the weekend and struggle to do that when his children are here as we alway make sure we are doing things with them. But I just get on with that. I feel I have compromised enough from my original boundaries. My partner doesn’t drive so at first he was getting the train because it was too much a two hour drive to pick them up on a Friday after work, Now I drive an hour and 20mins and the childs mum meets us at a mutually convenient location which I am very thankful to her for. I also at first said I would not have the children on my own at all but have compromised to having them if he was working nights. I have told my partner that his children and himself should be his priority and not me. Just as I am my priority along with my children. And he has to make a choice as to what he does. Id hate to lose him because of this and he said that won’t happen, but I’ve set my boundaries and will not compromise further on them. AITA?

Edit - when we have the children I plan day trips, weekends away, activities etc to make sure we are always doing something fun and exciting with them. 

Second edit - I have also told him if it falls that he’s working a Friday but off the Saturday and Sunday, I have no issue going to collect the child on my own and then they are here ready for a weekend of activities and fun.

Third edit- I am also at uni as well as working full time in a high stress job so any spare time I do get I’m working on assignments and research projects for that.

I think the difference is, my children are older and self sufficient. If I’m working late they will cook for themselves, and often my partner too so he’s not expected and doesn’t have to do anything for them."

I was called dramatic for getting anxious about running out of/not taking meds. I was called a hypochondriac for doing exercise to slow side affects. I’ve been belittled and made fun of, called a “dirty hippie” for changing my diet and taking supplements. My whole family treated me like some head case for being worried about my own health 

(disclaimer: I’m not that obsessed. I just like not to feel sick all the time so I look after myself)

I’ve moved out a while ago and my health has never been better. My sister on the other hand is saying her illness has gotten loads worse. I offered some tips and was met with a barrage of comments about it being “too late” for all that. My mum says I’m selfish and should have encouraged her to look after herself before it caused problems. 

I spent my whole young life encouraging both my mother and sister to do better by their health and was made fun of for it. I don’t personally feel I’m in the wrong as they ignored all my best efforts. 

My mum and sister think I’m selfish and that I’m rubbing my current good health in their faces. My mum thinks it was my responsibility to “teach” my sister as we had the same illness. 

AITAH: family ignored my effort to help them with our shared illness. Sister is now 10x worse and says it’s my fault for not warning her of complications"
zbh2g3_5338,zbh2g3,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I (m29) and my Fiancee (f29) have been together for 5 years overall, engaged for 2. I have always thought we were compatible but recently that has not been the case. 

My Fiancee, started a new job just over a year ago and I was ecstatic for her. She loves her job and has made alot of new friends who are generally cool people. One of these friends I will call, Becca she has got extremely close to and considers her best friend.

Last week we were having a few quiet drinks after date night and my Fiancee began talking about Becca and how her and her husband are ina open marriage. I kind of suspected this is the case from the times we have hung out with them and I don't judge them for it, they seem happy. I do know however this is something that i wouldnt want, and i was clear about this at the start of our relationship.

My Fiancee then admitted she had been talking to Becca about it and states she has been thinking about it over the last few weeks and she would be curious to hear more about it and wanted me to do some research with her. I was quite taken back and reminded her of my stance on open relationships, that we have discussed previously. This started a small argument of which she said that people can change their views over time and was upset that I refused to look into it with her. She called me narrow-minded and said it is better to be educated about such things, even if we don't end up doing it. I declined to look intp it and she ended up going to bed after this and ever since she the atmosphere has been cold and she has been distant. 

I love her very much and don't want to lose her but I know that I wouldnt be able to have an open relationship or invite someone else to bed with us. 

I'm not sure if there is any type of compromise or not, and not really sure if our relationship is over now? AITAH for not researching it with her?"
zbm3in_5344,zbm3in,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"So I’m 25 and currently writing my PhD thesis but attended a conference and got talking to a supervisor/PI who has a massive lab in America and is one of the top in the field (he literally was part of making a clinical device as part of his PhD nearly 30 years ago and has continued doing his research using it). There’s also no one else in Northern Ireland who uses this device so I’ve had to teach myself basically and I would gain so much experience going. There are people in republic of Ireland and UK using the device but there are no jobs currently available. 

He offered me to come over and give a talk to see if I like it but the post doc job would be there if I wanted it. I wasn’t originally looking or thinking of America because I never thought it was even on the cards that I would get the opportunity. 

My boyfriend (also 25) and I have been together/ living together for nearly 3 years. He’s my best friend and I want to spend the rest of my life with him (the possibility of marriage and kids etc in around 5 years has been discussed). 

From the start of my PhD we discussed how I would have to move away given the lack of opportunities in Northern Ireland for post docs. On top of that covid has reduced the amount of funding available for research and labs here are really struggling. We even told his friend, a couple of months ago that we wouldn’t know where we would be next year because of my job situation. I said I may have to move to Europe or at least mainland UK.

I was in France at a conference and the opportunity of being written into a grant was discussed. I spoke to my boyfriend about this but he felt it would be too difficult for him to integrate into Paris life as we don’t speak French and while I would be ok in an English speaking lab he probably wouldn’t have that at a job. I thought fair enough that’s a very valid point which would surely apply to all European countries. I did consider if I could go alone and do long distance for a year or so given it’s only a 1.5 hour flight and I felt really comfortable on my own there. Nothing ever came to fruition from it anyway and so we didn’t speak about it again.

When I was offered the all inclusive paid trip from the American PI to go and see if I liked the area and lab I was so shocked. It was only a few days later after meeting him so it was pretty overwhelming but he had outright said it’s ok if you don’t like it, it’s still an invited talk for your cv and I thought no brainer I’ll go for the 5 days. My bf agreed to come too to see if he would potentially move with me. That was all ok and my flights were booked. I got really excited about the opportunity. 

Weeks went by and I kept asking my bf to apply for his ESTA but he kept putting it off. He finally revealed he didn’t want to move there so felt there was no point going. This came as a shock to me but I blurted out the words ‘do you think we could do long distance’ without really thinking about it. He burst into tears and then so did I. I tried explaining how these opportunities don’t come around to everyone and that it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I quoted one of my colleagues that this was the PhD dream to go to a conference and be offered your dream job from just speaking to the PI. I advocated for myself which is something I really struggled with in the past. But it didn’t feel good. It felt like I had put a knife to his heart and twisted it with every word. So I stopped and we sobbed. 

We sobbed for a few weeks every night. He works from 7am-10/11pm 5-6 days a week with no time for conversations in between so we were both knackered but him especially. After a week or so I brought it up again and we sobbed again, he asked could I not just get a job in industry. I felt insulted considering he worked at an industry company here and hated it and left after 6 weeks. And I’ve heard so many of these stories about pharmacompanies and industry and I want to stay in research it’s my passion. That’s not to say it doesn’t have a plethora of flaws. 

But don’t I owe it to myself to try? I’ve been in uni 8 years+ to get to this point I’ve worked so hard. I asked him if he could just support me in trying this for myself but he said ‘how could I support you leaving. You’re leaving your family and friends and everything else behind.’ I felt pretty frustrated at this point so i just turned around in bed and cried. There was nothing I could say or do to change his mind. 

I feel so guilty -I’m the one cause for his pain and in advocating for myself I’m not taking it away. I supported him for over a year with his new job even though it has awful working hours and I have felt so alone and ignored and 2nd best to it because he would say there’s nothing I can do this is my job I need this experience. And so I compromised and said I didn’t know what I would do in his situation either so I’ll try and support you. So I was really disappointed in the lack of support from him. 

So AITAH?"

zbuv2s_5370,zbuv2s,top-comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"So before i start getting bunch of hate, let me explain.   


I (18F) have been in a 2 year relationship with my boyfriend (18M) and he and I understood what we were going into as I grew in a pretty religious Christian household while he lived in a religious Buddhist home. He and I understood what our political views were and moral views were and we were both fine with them. Even before this he came out as Bisexual and I didn't care as i still love him no matter what. Now, i'll make it short and say a few nights ago he told me, he was thinking of transitioning.   


Without a second i felt my stomach twist but not in disgust but... pain? Hurt? Betrayal? I myself don't even know what I felt since i never had to deal with this before. I soon slowly started crying as he told me he thinks that is what he wants and explained to me how he's been thinking about this for months. As i listened to him, he then asked me if i'd date him if he transitions. Now the thing is... I dislike changes, idk why but i do. I also been growing up with two religious parents who drilled all these religious things in my head that it is honestly difficult to forget or take out. So when he asked me if i'd date him if he was a woman, i said not. I said i can't and explained to him why. He soon said then he won't change since he wants to be with me forever.  


I then told him i don't want to do that since i don't want to stop him from being who he truly is meant to be. I don't want to stop him from being the person he's meant to be. He said he needs time as he is still figuring out what he really wants and he'll tell me what he wants to do and that he'll forever love me. I told him if he pushes through it, i'll still support him and love him no matter what, but i can't be with him romantically as that isn't what i believe and what i want in the future.   


I don't know if how i reacted was normal and if i was the asshole here. I don't know if i reacted normally, i don't know if crying on a 2 year relationship was normal and that i should've just forgotten my believes altogether. AITAH?

Edit 1: I just wanted to thank you all for the support and reassurance with this. Now one thing I noticed was the part where I mentioned my religion. Now when I said that I didn’t mean that is why I couldn’t be with him(kinda) but that it was already complicated me date him when he came out as Bi, and it was easy to forget as my religion is stupidly strict and has many limits that to me is too much. But the main reason I don’t want to date him afterwards was because I’m not into women.

Edit 2: We just spoke a few hours ago and he has said that he won’t be trans but push through with being a bit feminine (crossdressing but in private, painting nails and doing his makeup) but he said he can’t promise me that he won’t think about it and for us to forget about it and to enjoy the time left till he decides to do it or not. He said he still identify as a man and will continue to be my boyfriend."
zbuv2s_5372,zbuv2s,top-comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"So before i start getting bunch of hate, let me explain.   


I (18F) have been in a 2 year relationship with my boyfriend (18M) and he and I understood what we were going into as I grew in a pretty religious Christian household while he lived in a religious Buddhist home. He and I understood what our political views were and moral views were and we were both fine with them. Even before this he came out as Bisexual and I didn't care as i still love him no matter what. Now, i'll make it short and say a few nights ago he told me, he was thinking of transitioning.   


Without a second i felt my stomach twist but not in disgust but... pain? Hurt? Betrayal? I myself don't even know what I felt since i never had to deal with this before. I soon slowly started crying as he told me he thinks that is what he wants and explained to me how he's been thinking about this for months. As i listened to him, he then asked me if i'd date him if he transitions. Now the thing is... I dislike changes, idk why but i do. I also been growing up with two religious parents who drilled all these religious things in my head that it is honestly difficult to forget or take out. So when he asked me if i'd date him if he was a woman, i said not. I said i can't and explained to him why. He soon said then he won't change since he wants to be with me forever.  


I then told him i don't want to do that since i don't want to stop him from being who he truly is meant to be. I don't want to stop him from being the person he's meant to be. He said he needs time as he is still figuring out what he really wants and he'll tell me what he wants to do and that he'll forever love me. I told him if he pushes through it, i'll still support him and love him no matter what, but i can't be with him romantically as that isn't what i believe and what i want in the future.

zbz374_5377,zbz374,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,"I had a baby about 8 weeks ago. My pregnancy was completely healthy, zero issues. At 38 weeks, my doctor tried to push me into having an induction, but I wanted a natural birth. The next day I wasnt sure if I was having contractions or not so I called and I was told to go in and have everything looked at. My doctor called the hospital and told them to admit me regardless of labor. I wasn't very dialated but when the nurse was checking my cervix the second time, I hadn't dilated more but my water broke. She was way rougher than the first check as well. I ended up being in active labor for 22 hours. The nurses kept checking the baby but she wasnt progressing past my pelvic bone at all. They kept trying to turn her or have me push her out a little more but nothing was happening. I was stuck at 9 centimeters for 5 hours flip flopping. When my doctor got there, she also tried to adjust my baby but to no avail. It turns out my pelvic bone had not loosened during pregnancy so my baby couldn't come out. Instead of offering me a C-section (I was already numbed), she pulled my pelvic bone apart and attached a suction to my baby. Then to top it all off she had a nurse put all of her body weight on my stomach to keep my baby from going back in. This experience was incredibly traumatic for no reason. I'm considering suing for emotional damages and unnecessary medical practices. But I also feel kinda bad about doing so."

I'm in a 1.5 year relationship with a partner who is separated from wife. 

We live togheter but he stays at the the wife's place 2 nights weekdays,  and every second weekend.  
He spends with me 2 nights a week some weeks and alternate  weekends. 
We live 1.5  hrs away from wife's house and we are building a house togheter. 
I have accepted this  arrangement until our house is built  for the sake of the kids.

5 days ago he got sick and ER thought it was heart failure , he was hospitalised ( hospital same city as wifes) 

I was  distressed, I broke down crying at work, he is my only person ( my family live abroad ) . Other than my colleagues I have no support. 

He was discharged 48 hrs heart issued were ruled out, and I had offered to visit him and pick him up after he was discharged. He said it would be too much hassle and anyway was his weekend on with the kids so he was staying there.
It turns out he had to go to emergencies again and he was being admitted to hospital yet again (but he decided to leave the hospital as he saw no point).

Instead of coming down to where we live he stayed there, I said to myself , "" well he is tired so he might as well"" 

 I asked him if he could make an exception and come down see me, I offered to meet him half way the wife's city, he said he didn't feel like driving.  I offered to pick him up ( this was a conversation on a Friday) he said that we will meet Sunday eve as usual. ( even though he was feeling much better)

I argued that I was distressed and that he was still having symptoms and that no one could guarantee he wouldn't have to be admitted again in hospital. That I really wanted to see him sooner than that.
He refused, I said, well is it because you are driving the kids to matches ? He said no, he just wanted to rest.
I asked again on Saturday if he could come down, as he said he was felling better. Again refused.

I'm going to be away from the country for 5 weeks in a weeks time. He has teh whole Dec to spend with his kids.

I feel devastated that he is snubbing me.

 I wanted him to be  recovering  with me, not with the ex.  My colleagues at work were asking when was he back at home with me, I was embarrassed to say he wasn't. 

I have broken up with him unless he changes his sleeping arrangements.  He said he needs to wait a couple of years as his kids are small ( 9 and 11 and two teenagers) I said I couldn't wait that, that he has the means to pay for a nanny and so does his wife ( he does quite well financially) 

I need advice on way forward 

Summary: partner lives with me, yet decided to recover with his wife.
They thought it was his heart this has been ruled out, he is just swollen around the legs and face but that is improving..so possibly is something minor.



Edit because some people are asking: 
1* I gave him options to go and visit him, he said no. 
2* Pick him up drive him to our home

4'* he told me I could not visit because of covid restrictions, but then he told me that the reception area was opened and he saw the kids and wife
5* even my boss offered a ride.
6* all along he said he was feeling fine, he drove around to go for pizza with the kids after discharged.  Went to drop kids the day after to different sport


Edit: I'm talking to him...he has been treating Me like a side piece. 
He is saying he wants me to meet his wife

Edit 2: thanks to all of you for your advice

UPDATE: he is saying that his divorced papers are stalled because she now wants more money. My background is legal so I know that this doesn't prevent him from serving the divorce papers. He just told me he didn't want to tell me about the stalling. 

Apparently I could have visited him in hospital.

When I asked what would happen  if he had an accident when he is visiting, say scenario "" car crash nearby the wife's home..ends up in a wheelchair "" he nonchalantly said he probably will stay in her house. I said I can get a special taxi to take you back to.our place ...he said maybe he will be better off at the Exes.. same answer when I posed the cancer scenario.

He is promising me he will arrange for the kids and the wife to meet me, will send my hone number to his family.

Didn't answer anything about meeting his parents. 

That kinda shows the life I will have .

Nope !"

I (21f) and my best friend (21m) we will call him “B”, had been best friends since we were born, growing up right across the street from each other. When I say best friends, we literally talked (if we weren’t hanging out) until this incident all day everyday. 

Last February (2021) B met a girl where he lives named E (19f) and they began dating, B moved 3 hours away after high school but we still saw each other frequently. He wanted me to meet her, so he brought her to our hometown to hangout. Her and I got along so good, and for about 2 months we all remained close, I considered her one of my best friends. 

Her and B had an argument, B reached out to me via text to vent. I do not like to be involved in any way, but he is my best friend and it is my job to be a shoulder to lean on. He didn’t say much, and in my responses to him I sort of defended E as this situation I understood her side more. There was maybe 6 exchanged texts totals and they were fine not even 20 min later. Or so I thought…

Fast forward to Easter, E goes through his phone and looks at our texts. I had not known this until asking why she began to ghost me for a week. She broke up with B and blamed him venting to me as “being a part of their relationship” even though B is the one who came to me, and told B she felt as if he listened to my advice more serious than hers. So as you readers can already see where this is going, it was a “her or me” type deal from E. She told B she would not give him another chance until I talked to her and apologized  for “being a part of their relationship.” B begged that I do this for him despite him admittedly knowing she was in the wrong. I did it only because I knew how much it meant to him, not that I felt like I did anything wrong. She never responded, she didn’t get back with him like she said, she instead tormented him and emotionally abused him said extremely disgusting things about me. B even caught her back with her (said to be abusive)  ex. At this point, B was in pain so I sent an additional text telling her to grow up. This made things harder for B as she immediately blocked his # and he decided to blame loosing her on me, in which I sent a final text to him as well telling him how I feel about him throwing me into this situation and how hurt I was. He never responded and it has been 7 months since we have spoken. 

I thought I did everything I could for him despite the situation he dragged me into and how badly E treated me, and how he let her do so. AITA for sending her that final text and causing this? I am so hurt that I feel I should have let them continue to treat me poorly so I didn’t lose his friendship permanently. I feel I am grieving the loss of someone who is still alive.

zcjnnv_5411,zcjnnv,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"My (31F) husband (36M), learned he had stage 4 cancer and began treatments in January. Through the entire process, I was by his side at every appointment and at home. I was always there and caring for him through this devastating and terrifying ordeal. His biological family? Not so much. They didn’t really check in or anything. His mom called every once in awhile to harass him in some way. For example, she would go on a diatribe about how he needed to pray more for God to heal him. That he needed to quit his job. That he needed to get rid of our birds (she believed that the birds caused his stomach cancer). This list can go on and on for days. 
When he was in the hospital for neutropenia, she again harassed him about getting rid of the birds and he refused. One of them was his ESA. He adores her so much. He made a full recovery within 5 days and was back at home and cried when he saw his bird. He was so happy to be reunited with her. 
A month later, he was admitted again but this time because he was literally bleeding internally. His mother spread a rumor that he was hospitalized for histoplasmosis. She even had his sister make a hateful post towards me saying I was killing him with my refusal to get rid of the birds even though they didn’t cause his cancer, weren’t making him worse and they actually brought him joy. At that moment, everything changed. He became very irritated which was so rare and an order was put in place by the doctor that any visitor had to go be cleared by the nurse station. They said my husband told them that he only wanted to see his wife (me).  His mom called the hospital every 15 minutes, trying to get info but was denied that due to HIPPA. She was fuming. She then called my husband screaming at him, insisting that he had histoplasmosis, that he needed to get rid of the birds, that she had a right to know what was wrong with her (adult) child, that he needed to quit his job and that his siblings were “afraid” that their brother will die due to this. (Why wasn’t the fact it was stage 4 concerning to them?)
The last 3 days of his life, he was in the hospital as he went into sudden liver and kidney failure. The second day, I was in meetings with hospice, transport and doctors. This gave his family alone time with him which I was sure they appreciated. However, it came to my attention that while I was signing the papers to place him in hospice and transport him home, his mother attempted to undermine me and have him taken into in-patient where he already expressed he didn’t want to be. He already expressed his desire to be at home. I honestly thought that this was all about having more access to him but I later learned it was because she believed that he would live longer there (and suffer longer). Spoiler alert: the level of care is no different whether you are in the in-patient hospice or home hospice. 
She even tried to get a doctor to agree with her on him being transported to in-patient and insisted that his wife shouldn’t get to decide because “they haven’t been married long enough” in her eyes. When I left for home to ready the house for his arrival, his brother stole my husband’s clothing and shoes. I had the good sense to take his wallet with me but the cash that he always kept in his wallet was gone. 
My husband arrived home at 9pm that night and passed away 6 hours after his arrival. 
The funeral planning began instead of being buried in a plot purchased by his mother, he wanted to be cremated with the condition that part of him would be made into an artful ash sculpture. I was totally content in providing his family with a portion of his remains until I was on the receiving end of their relentless hatred. 
The day before his funeral, his mom took to facebook to make a bold claim that I was going to his place of employment, begging for money. He had a high security position that requires a badge to get in the doors. So even if I wanted to do that (which I wouldn’t ever) I couldn’t. 
I was also accused of killing him. 
His mom also said that I would’ve rather had the life insurance policy than my husband which is another huge lie. I’d give up everything I own to have him. I’d live homeless, under a bridge to have him. 
His brother stole a gift that my husband got for my dad and brother. It was at his place of employment. 
And the deciding factor of this decision was the fact that I learned that my late husband’s brother sought a lawyer to try to strip me of his possessions and his insurance policy.  The state law gives everything to the surviving spouse unless otherwise stipulated in a will. We had all the documents ready because of his condition. Everything was left to me just as everything was left to him in mine. 
They cared more about his stuff and his money than him because if they didn’t, they would’ve checked in on him. They would’ve showed up to support him. They would’ve been there for him in that last year of his life but instead, they threw a fit because they received nothing. 
They asked for 6 artful ash sculptures (they’re $185 per sculpture) and wanted me to foot that bill and I refused. After everything they’ve put he and I through, and trust me, there’s plenty that isn’t in here, I don’t feel they should have any bit of him. But I wonder… am I the asshole?"

My husband arrived home at 9pm that night and passed away 6 hours after his arrival. 
The funeral planning began instead of being buried in a plot purchased by his mother, he wanted to be cremated with the condition that part of him would be made into an artful ash sculpture. I was totally content in providing his family with a portion of his remains until I was on the receiving end of their relentless hatred. 
The day before his funeral, his mom took to facebook to make a bold claim that I was going to his place of employment, begging for money. He had a high security position that requires a badge to get in the doors. So even if I wanted to do that (which I wouldn’t ever) I couldn’t. 
I was also accused of killing him. 
His mom also said that I would’ve rather had the life insurance policy than my husband which is another huge lie. I’d give up everything I own to have him. I’d live homeless, under a bridge to have him. 
His brother stole a gift that my husband got for my dad and brother. It was at his place of employment. 
And the deciding factor of this decision was the fact that I learned that my late husband’s brother sought a lawyer to try to strip me of his possessions and his insurance policy.  The state law gives everything to the surviving spouse unless otherwise stipulated in a will. We had all the documents ready because of his condition. Everything was left to me just as everything was left to him in mine. 
They cared more about his stuff and his money than him because if they didn’t, they would’ve checked in on him. They would’ve showed up to support him. They would’ve been there for him in that last year of his life but instead, they threw a fit because they received nothing. 
They asked for 6 artful ash sculptures (they’re $185 per sculpture) and wanted me to foot that bill and I refused. After everything they’ve put he and I through, and trust me, there’s plenty that isn’t in here, I don’t feel they should have any bit of him. But I wonder… am I the asshole?"

My parents are South American immigrants and Spanish (+ Portuguese) is my first language however I am also fluent in English. I speak Spanish exclusively to my children or family members, and I do not speak Spanish outside of that. I like speaking English and sometimes it’s tiring not being able to have a conversation in English. I don’t even admit to speaking nor understanding it to *anyone* because I’d rather coworkers or friends not ask me to translate or speak it outside of my home.

Now here’s where I may be the AH. I am one of 3 managers and we had an absolutely irate woman who was trying to get something specific and she simply wasn’t being understood. After 15 minutes, I finally had enough of the other two giving her the run around and told them what they were doing wrong, how they could fix it and what she actually wanted, etc. Both managers speak Spanish, though they are third generation if that matters? It’s more spanglish to me when they speak. Now I’m adding in this part: My job title is Manager - data analytics. The other two managers job titles are Manager - customer service however all three of us are over the entire department, though I solely run the data side of our company. People ask me questions because i generally know what I’m talking about, and sometimes if there isn’t another manager i will have to step in and de-escalate however it is not in my job description to do so. 

The next day I got called into HR where they asked if I spoke any other languages to which I responded “no” The HR woman said that it was reported I did and she would write me up if I avoided a customer again (putting it on the other two managers.) she said she knows I can speak Spanish and I need to be helping these customers. I gave my notice because it’s not my job to help them, I’m not getting paid for it and I don’t want to speak it. They hired me knowing damn well I could “not” speak Portuguese or Spanish. They will not adjust my pay to speak it occasionally. Thus, I will not continue my employment if they still expect it of me. The complaint also mentioned that I could’ve been eavesdropping that whole time and they felt violated. Although I didn’t feel that comment was necessary for the post since it wasn’t related to me asking my question , that is the main reason I put in my two weeks.

Everyone at my work is talking badly about me including the other managers because I still refuse to help out with spanish speaking customers and I’m leaving “more work” to the other two managers. The way I see it, I exclusively speak Spanish 80% of the time, let me have my English time plus I don’t even get paid extra for knowing two other languages. I told my family about this and it’s pretty split. AITAH?"

I (18F) recently move into my first apartment in a city 7 hours away from my town to study in college. About two months ago I surprised my family back in my hometown but as it seems I was the one getting the biggest surprise and not in a good way. My father ANNOUNCED to me that my cousin (21F) will be moving in with me for 4 months on March because of her job. Never talked to me about it, we never discussed anything, he just announced it to me. I got really mad when he told me that because first of all I haven't spoke with my cousin in more than 10 years and I don't really know anything about her so I can't just let in a stranger. Second of all my house is not really that big. There's only one bedroom and a closet so that means that she has to live on my couch and I have to find a place for all of her clothes because they don't fit in my closet. I basically have to change my whole life because I was used to living alone. I had things the way I wanted and didn't have to worry about anyone. I also recently found a job in a night bar so that means that Ill be coming home late at night and now I will have to worry about waking her up. I tried to talk to my father about it because I really don't feel comfortable having a stranger in my house and just having to share everything with her. I know she is my cousin but I don't know anything about her or what kind of person she is. He never tried to understand me or at least listen to me so there's nothing I can do. He already told my aunt that I would be really happy to have my cousin around but that's not the truth. So am I the a****** ?"

zcvna8_5432,zcvna8,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"I (22M) and my girlfriend (21F) having been dating since high school years. We’ve been high school sweethearts since sophomore year. I’m in my final year of college and she is a third year. I say I know her very well, possibly the best anyone else does. She’s athletic due to her prodigious skill in volleyball and competitive cheer, a genius in business and economics, and a jewel with an amazing singing talent. Some perceive her as a cold, blunt, straightforward machine. So did I when I met her; but she is everything but that. She’s a sensitive, caring, energetic, classy woman who just needs to warm up to people. We met when she had just transferred to my school, she became a known name very quickly. My girlfriend is a jewel, a gem, a beauty. She’s gorgeous and my heart still flutters when her name is brought up or I see her. I was on the male’s football team as she was on the volleyball team. I came across her in the gym and we began to play volleyball and since then history was made.

Besides all the glorious love and butterflies, something has been off with her recently. I’ve seen my girlfriend get happy, sad, and disappointed. One thing she tries to avoid at all costs is her getting irritated, angered, annoyed. If she does become any of those emotions, it never really ends well for the other party. This is where the “machine” part comes in. It’s as if my girlfriend shuts down and she becomes someone different. She either expresses her anger through eye contact and silence or the opposite. She becomes verbal and extremely expressional, once or twice she nearly became physical. My girlfriend has anger issues but she keeps it extremely concealed, isolating herself from other people and crowds when she is pissed off. It’s a trait of hers that I appreciate. She cools her mind before that “other person” says something.

However, recently she’s been irritated too easily. My girlfriend comes home to her apartment, calls me and we FaceTime, and I can feel the tension and uneasiness. I feel as if I’m not talking to the girl I fell in-love with but instead Im talking to the girl everyone thinks she is. I’m not worried that she’s cheating or falling out of love, she would be extremely straight forward with it. She doesn’t drink, she finds alcohol as a sin due to events in her past. The most I’ve seen her drink was light wine (only a few sips). Yet every time we call I see a glass of red wine in the back, just sitting there. Her roommates do drink but it’s not theirs. When I bring up her day she becomes cold, dim, and unamused. Usually says “Nothing much. Same shit.” and I’m not sure what to respond with. Yet, in person she’s the same girl I asked out.

Here’s where I got confused. My girlfriend and I have good pays, so we treat ourselves to dinner every now and then. As if it was planned against her, an old friend of hers reserved the table next to us. My girlfriend got annoyed quickly, standing and staring at the individual as if she had just committed a crime. The other girl made sarcastic remarks which would normally set my girlfriend off the rails but instead my girlfriend just stood there. No words exchanged, no sighs, nothing. As if she had shut down again. Immediately as soon as my girlfriend finally exhaled a breath, she walked over to another table and apologized, grabbing their drink and threw it on her old friend. Hell was opened, yelling and insults, nearly trying to fight my girlfriend, everything. Yet she just stood there with the glass clenched in her hand and she looked AMUSED.

Normally I would think my girlfriend has some remorse or sympathy for the poor girl but she enjoyed doing that. Seeing someone else freak out and go berserk was fun to her. To be frank, I was a bit taken back but I’m extremely confused. We were escorted out of course but she acted as if nothing has happened.

I don’t know if she had does this before and  figured it was the time I had seen another side of her.. However, my girlfriend wouldn’t just throw someone else’s drink on someone she disliked? Do I know her or am I thinking too hard? As soon as I brought her to my apartment I expressed how I felt. Well, I yelled at her. She had gone over board and ruined the dinner night. Yes, the remarks was immature but it was not needed. My girlfriend froze and looked at me as if I DID IT?

This happened on Friday and it is currently Sunday night, no calls or texts had been exchanged. Am I the asshole for telling her she was in the wrong? That she should’ve just sat down and ignored the smart ass?"

zd1it1_5439,zd1it1,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"So I (21)M and my 19(F) have been dating for about a year now, and she hasn’t ever acted this way before. So what happened was we were tiding up my apartment one morning around 11 am after she spent the night, when she started acting strange, when I asked her if she was ok she said she was fine. Well as time would tell she wasn’t, she started to stumble and become incoherent. I had no idea why she was acting this way because I had been with her all morning. She is on medication that doesn’t mix well with any other substances and such. And I thought maybe since these meds were relatively new that maybe she was having a side effect or was having a reaction to the cleaning supplies. Well she starts to get very aggressive and cussing me out and overall verbally assaulting me. Remember this is around noon I haven’t seen her eat or drink anything, the only thing I found was a cup under the sink in the bathroom earlier while cleaning and thought “that’s a weird place for the cup to be” (I know I’m oblivious but makes sense later). Well now she is screaming at me and hitting me for no good reason other than the floor wasn’t clean yet and she was going to drive back to her place. I obviously didn’t know what was happening but I wasn’t going to let her drive if she couldn’t walk. As I’m standing in front of the door she grabs and claws at me to get past all while she’s screaming, she falls over and start puking and not responding to me , at this point I call 911 and she starts screaming that she doesn’t want anyone over and the operator lets me know an ambulance and officers are heading over now. Once they get to my apartment he doesn’t cooperate and refuses treatment but also gets a super bad nose bleed that she’s prone to having. I mean it’s bad enough the responders decide ti take her to the hospital just for the bleeding. They had to restrain and sedate her once she got to the hospital. The officers questioned me and the EMTs about when the bleeding started obviously looking for domestic abuse, luckily the EMTs vouched for me. After they leave I look in my fridge and a good portion of my wine I purchased days ago was missing, then it clicks she was sneaking drinks when I wasn’t looking. In my state idk about others but if a drunk driver kills someone the supplier can be held liable. Well long story short we had some talks and she said she would never do that again, well I woke up at 8 and found her sneaking drinks again, when I confronted her she lied to my face, I literally found a cup with wine in it. Now she is angry that I have dumped all my alcohol and told her that she has to pick that or me. She said she is her own person and is mad that she has to pay medical bills after she saved money to buy gifts for her family. Idk if what I did was right or if I should continue this relationship or help pay the bill."

I’ve been slowly falling out of love with her before she was pregnant and before we lost the child. She broke me when I woke up to a text and a picture of my child in the doctors hand and later her saying that she can’t have any children because of how complicated this pregnancy was which ultimately ended with our child passing.

I called him in the evening and told him how he made me feel for not socializing and being there with me. He said he didn't see if he did anything wrong. I just got mad and asked for a break.

I had a boyfriend of 5 years. (Prior to that we were best friends for 2 years) We were dating online for 4 years and he came to my country one year ago. 
As soon as he got here, it was like a whole different person then what I’ve known. 
He wasn’t kind like online and he was very controlling.
He also did some random stuff I won’t put in detail rn but it weirded me out a lot.
I’ve tried talking about it but he’d always say it’s the culture difference.
I’ve once vented on this application the things he did and everyone adviced me to break up.
I finally did after a year and he didn’t take it so well.
He’d come to my home, hid until I went to work. Tried to pull me back to him, kiss me,…
It scared me a lot and after 8 times saying no we are done he asked me for a final decision, once again I said it’s done and it seemed like he understood. He asked me not to reply to him.
I have to say I have been really friendly in this break up and said he could still count on me just not as a couple, I said he’s a good guy we are just not a good match.
He went quiet for one week and then suddenly texted me saying we can put the Xmas tree up togheter and act normal again. I ignored him as I’m really exhausted by this whole situation. The love is just gone, I went trough to much and regret ever dating him.
The day after he threw a fit and said I’m ghosting him and played a dirty game on him, and that he sacrificed so much for me.
I still did not reply and afterwards he started begging again for a chance.
What do I do? AITA for not replying anymore?"

zdgsl2_5475,zdgsl2,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Okay so, I f24 recently came out to my parents. From the beginning i knew there were 2 outcomes . Either they accepted me or they would kick me out. So i’ve known i was gay since i was 15 i tried coming out to my parents and they did NOT take it well. They threatened to send me to conversion camp, they cut off all my communication by taking my phone up and making me delete all my social medias. Also aside from all that my mom got physical with me. (I guess wanting to beat the gay out of me) . To make it stop i told them i was just confused and had mistaken my friendship with my back then gf. I started to overly go boy crazy changing boyfriends like clothes. Fast forward to this past september where there was conflict with my parents and i decided to come clean and tell them i was gay hoping it would make the conflict go away. By telling them who i was dating and where i spent most of my time. I know i could have done it better but out of fear for what happened when i was 15 i told them over the phone. I just ripped the band aid off. I told them i was tired of lying and hiding. So i came out. My parents completely blew this out of proportion. Both of them humiliated me, telling me i was going to hell, and that my life style was a sin, and that i was disgusting, etc. (i am currently in college , so i rely heavy on my parents during the semester to help me out financially) as soon as i came out. They cut me off financially, which i saw that coming bc they like to hold that over my head. Hours later after coming out, i got a very extensive and demeaning text from my mom. Telling me how i wasnt shit, and how i have to go back home, work at a place she picks, and how id have to give them my car back. Aside from the verbal and emotional abuse i decided to be the better person and not reply. Once the weekend rolled around. They expected me to come home , but i was too scared of them to face them. So i blocked everyone in my familys #’s so i could have a moment of silence to think of what i would do. Almost instantly my mom started calling all of my friends that she knew off, and started playing the worried mom card . Telling my friends i was missing, and she hadnt heard from me all week. When literally 2 days earlier i had came out to them and got shunned from my family. As the day progresses she starts going over board . Calling , and calling my friends. At this point im anxious as can be with a fear of her finding me. Just as i was about to call her i receive a message from my brother (the only one in my family to accept me and have my back) telling me “hey mom is angry and is looking for you to beat your ass for not coming home” . Which sent me into and anxiety attack. Thankfully my friends hid me and my car away . She decided to drive to my apartment and broke in, tried to break into my room , forcing her way in breaking my doorframe. She then restricts my internet access on my phone, then ironically decides to pay everyones phone bill with my card knowing i am not currently financially stable being in school. Lastly she texted my girlfriend threatening her by telling her she made a “enemy of her” and telling her i was no longer welcome at home and i was no longer part of the family. Finishing up with “also since she wants to hide from me i will report her car stolen” and lastly procedes by calling the cops on me. Thankfully i was able to revert everything she did in 2 days in 1 . Had my locks changed as well. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. She showed up to my apartment with no warning wanting to talk things out. Which even after all that i was nice enough to listen her out. Which i ended up regretting. I had to go thru 2 hours of hearing her victimize herself talking about how this affected her way too much, and how this makes the family look. With no regards of how in a span of 2 days she turned my life into living hell. If only she knew that for the past 2 months i have been living with ptsd everytime i hear a car passing by my apartment , constantly looking over my shoulder at stores with the fear of them finding me. Aita for cutting them off after how they reacted?

Edit: first of all thank you all for the advice i kindly appreciate it. Thankfully before any of this happened i had already payed my school, i work very hard during the summer and winter break to save up money for every semester to pay for my own school, the car is under my name, yet they threatened to take it from me because my dad co signed it. When i said they help me financially i meant they help me when i am in school. Unfortunately i work less hours and i dont make enough to pay for all my things . I have read about applying for a loan which is something i hadnt thought about. Thanks to you guys i’ve put that into consideration. Im not asking for you guys to feel bad for me. Its just something so personal and something that hurt me so deeply i didnt know who to talk to or ask for advice. But i am thankful for the advice i was given today."
zdiu7t_5480,zdiu7t,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Edit: Verdict is YTA (AKA I'm the asshole) for having suspicions regarding my mother's intentions about buying candy.

---------

I know, it sounds ridiculous at first, but hear me out.

When I was younger, my family had a tradition of filing the stockings with candy. I don't remember much of this time, but originally my sister and I's stockings would be filled with the candy we liked (or at least I hope my sister's was. I was favored and I don't remember this time very well.) This tradition abruptly stopped a few years ago; there was no longer any expectation of it happening.

So imagine my surprise when my mother suddenly tells me the stockings have been filled, even though we have extra people living with us and are strained financially for Christmas from a bunch of expensive purchases the past several months. I'm already highly suspicious of my mother's intentions for a lot of other stuff, so I was more so confused and questioning, rather than excited.

I decided to check what candy was actually in it, and it's a mixed bag. The first that catches my eye are some sweets or versions of sweets which none of us have even had before, such as pockies or cookies n cream hershey's chocolate. The second thing that catches my eye are hershey's chocolate with nuts in them, which the entire family has known for years that I hate and will not eat (my mother loves them though.) The third are kit kats, which isn't anybody's favorite in the family. There are SOME which we actually like, but I find the mixed bag that she went with as being kind of odd. Additionally, the candies I did find that I would like are all collected at the bottom, suggesting a separate smaller bag...odd, considering there'd be no point in the rest (which we know from past experience will likely go uneaten) other than to make it completely full.

Perhaps there's some context that explains it, though?

As I mentioned before the budget is lower this Christmas due to financial strain and extra people in the house. We had to replace multiple electronic appliances (a dishwasher, dryer, washing machine, and care), so maybe this is all we could afford? Yet my mother was perfectly willing to also buy tons of random baked goods and candy the past several months, too, as well as a new coffee maker (the old one worked fine), along with various flavors and stuff for that coffee. She's never had any qualms buying the higher-quality stuff, even though we're under financial strain and she is not the one working. And when she buys this stuff, she isn't asking the family what they want, but just buying TONS of stuff SHE wants to try with DAD's money (she has never asked Dad before buying anything.) We receive lots of Amazon packages under her name, so I suspect she's also bought a lot more unnecessary stuff we don't even need than I've realized. Some of it is dog stuff (we already receive toys each month and the dogs are well cared for already). Additionally, why use what limited money we do have on candy that no one is even expecting, since it hasn't been done for years, and do it on candy which likely won't even get eaten? It doesn't make any sense to me.

The only other thing I can think of is maybe they literally couldn't find the right candy to fill the rest of the bag? But that also makes little sense to me, as that would mean my parents knowingly wasted money on candy no one would eat for a tradition we stopped years ago, at a time when my mother had already bought plenty of treats to satisfy everyone for months. Additionally, we don't need the stockings completely full, because again, there's already been unnecessary amounts of sweets my mother has bought (my father doesn't buy sweets often unless asked to). I'm too afraid of upsetting my mother to ask about it, as I don't want to be accused of being ungrateful or cause unnecessary stress for my father. It's not my money, afterall, and I don't even want more candy as there's already been a ton the past several months, so I figured it'd be best to just leave it alone.

But I can't help but think that perhaps the point of the candy wasn't as a surprise gift, but an opportunity for my mother to make herself look good while there's other people in the house. Things have been unusually calm in the house since my sister and her roommates moved in. Am I paranoid? Ungrateful and spoiled? Or might there actually be some merit to my suspicions?

Am I the Asshole for suspecting my mother of getting us candy to look good?

I'm 19F, soon to be 20. My sister is about 5-6 years older than me at any given time, so we're both adults. Not sure if it matters, but I'm jobless trying to get a grip on my mental health, while my sister works in the food industry, and had to move in with her roommates due to unaffordable rent. It might lead credence to the idea of me being spoiled, as well as give context as to why there are so many people in the house (6 total, 4 family, 2 roommates). Currently, there are 4 dogs and 3 cats in the house. We're middle class. United States for cultural context. I tried to cover everything I could think of, but let me know if you need any more context."

On November 21st my 18m friend 16m asked me to cash one of his paychecks for him, which was a pretty common occurrence, seeing as he doesn’t have his own bank account. The check was for about $200 and I had about $100 in my account, he asked me to give him $100 immediately, and I took the $100 in my account and gave it to him, and he spent it immediately. We went to go cash the check and it wouldn’t clear until December 1st. At the time we didn’t think this would be an issue and I would pay him back when the check dropped, but because I gave him my $100 and the check did not drop, I had $0 in my account. 

Now the issue is my phone bill got pulled out automatically, while my account was still at $0, causing it to overdraft from both t-Mobil and chase. I told him this the second it happened and even tried to contact my bank about getting the check cleared earlier, and they told me it was a problem with my friends bank, the bank his employer uses, I informed him of every mishap that happened with his check immediately, so he was aware that my account was negative the amount of his check, and that I most likely wouldn’t be able to pay him the second the check actually cashed. December 1st came and I told him I couldn’t pay him yet as I had no money in my account due to the fees. 

He texted me three days later super aggressively, and when I told him I could pay him at the end of week, he told me that wasn’t going to cut it, and continued to argued with me about it, threatening to call the cops saying I stole from him, and that he was going to get his mom involved. I told him to give me his moms number as I thought it would be more reasonable to talk to an adult about financial issues, because he clearly wasn’t understanding what was happening, she threatened to call her policeman brother, and basically refused to talk to me or her son to resolve the issue. I’m still paying him at the end of the week, I just wanted to know if I am in the wrong.

zeetwz_5494,zeetwz,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"Before you call me an AH, I know how the title sounds but hear me out.

I (24f) am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (25M). We'll call him Dave. I have a daughter (4F) from a previous relationship.

My boyfriend and I met online through a game and mutual friends. We had dated previously in the year but ended on a sour note. Recently however we decided to try things again. 

Dave likes to call when he wakes up which I have no issues with. I love spending time with him, playing video games or even watching movies. He tries to include my children occasionally. 

 Here's where I may be the AH.

My daughter likes to be outdoors and adventurous. I have always taken her out and encouraged her curiosity. With the holidays approaching,  she is very big on being outside when there is ice because she enjoys playing on the ice patches. I stay with her and make sure she doesn't slip and fall. We've gone to see several tree lightings since the start of December along with Santa visits. We've gone to do crafts, decoration shopping, present shopping for her father. Dave, however, gets annoyed when we do these things because my children and I are out for hours at a time. Sometimes the entire day.

If I don't answer my phone when he calls or texts me, he starts to get angry. He accuses me of ghosting him or ignoring him. I have to tell him what I'm doing at every point in the day. It might also be important to say that Dave has no children of his own and isn't a big fan of kids himself. 

When I explain myself to him, I feel as if he shrugs it off as nothing because it always comes back that I'm in the wrong for never spending time with him. It gets hard balancing 2 kids and a distant relationship on my own. I can't talk to any friends about this because they tell him and he gets angry with me again.

I've always been the shy type and I find it hard to tell people know. I'm afraid of confrontation and retaliation. I try to avoid it at all costs.

Yesterday, Dave and I had made plans to watch a movie and play a few video games. I messaged him when I woke up but got no response until mid-afternoon around 4. By that point I had taken my daughter to listen to christmas music and play on ice patches with other children. When I told him I was watching my daughter play on ice, he laughed and accused me of lying to him and not caring about him. He said I never want to spend time with him and that he cant trust a word that comes out of me.

So am I wrong for taking my daughter to play and listen to music?"

zembdm_5508,zembdm,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Hi yall, I know the title sounds horrible, it is horrible and I never meant for it to happen. My (23F) soon to be ex husband (34M) and I were together for a little over 5 years now. Dated for around a year, married for 4. During these 5 years he had made it very clear that he wanted kids, soon. I had tried to express that I didn’t want any for the time being, which led to him getting upset with me. 

I reluctantly agreed that we would start trying after he set up a nursery with my MIL while I was traveling out of state for my best friend’s wedding. This hurt me a lot. I knew he wanted kids and don’t get me wrong I want kids too! I am still young and we do not need to rush anything. We got into a huge argument and he went to stay with his parents. Since this argument, MIL has not liked me. Before she loved me, if she didn’t I doubt my ex and I would have ever gotten married, he’s a huge mama’s boy. 

I had to beg him to come back home. Everyone I knew was telling me I was making a huge mistake, that I could lose my marriage and that I should “just give in because I want kids anyways.” That argument was mid March this year we weren’t speaking again until early April. This was the first time we’d ever gone so long without speaking, he never checked up on me once. He didn’t answer my calls or text when I sent them, I was worried about him the whole time. I had to go see him in person to make up, in the end we agreed to start trying.

Although we made up before April, MIL refused to invite me over for Easter dinner. MIL invited my ex over though, he went. He left me all alone on Easter. I ended up going out with my friend’s family after they kindly offered, he yelled at me for going.                     

Around May I found out I was pregnant. Ex, MIL, and all of my family were ecstatic, I was the only one who wasn’t. I felt confused about my whole marriage, let alone having kids with him. I let myself get overwhelmed with stress, which caused me to miscarry 2 weeks before my gender reveal. 

When I found out, I was in hysterics. I still am. I stressed out so much over having a baby, it eventually took my baby. He didn’t look at me the whole car ride home. I remember just sobbing as he walked inside the house, I stayed in the car for a while. Until my MIL came over, she was sobbing too. She pounded on the car window and screamed at me. She just kept screaming through the window how I took their baby away, that I was a monster, that I planned this because I didn’t want kids. My door never unlocked since I never got out, Ex’s door was unlocked and he eventually came running outside to stop MIL since the whole neighborhood heard. He grabbed my MIL and hugged her, went inside with her and left me again. I never felt so alone besides right in that moment. 

Eventually my ex comes out to the car, demanding I open the door. I thought he would hug me. The one who lost the actual baby inside of her. But no. He pulled me inside by my arm, he had his hand over my mouth because I guess I was crying very loud. That’s what he told me after. 

He yanks me inside, he starts yelling about how our neighbor was concerned. Somehow MIL gets in my face, accusing me of killing my baby. My head was spinning and I don’t even remember why I decided to do this but she pushed me after getting in my face. My ex turned away, I just remember looking at him and looking at MIL. MIL was standing somewhat near the door, I turned her and pushed her into it with everything I could. I screamed that I didn’t do this and I loved my baby. 

MIL is a heavy set woman. My door was an old one, we aren’t rich by any means. She fell through it. My ex threw his phone and raced to MIL’s side. She screamed out in pain and I just felt like she was right. I felt like a monster. He put his hands on me after, I don’t really want to get into that. It wasn’t the first time. I grew up with DV in my house, so leaving my home to his wasn’t much of a difference.

The cops were not called. I do not live in a nice neighborhood, yelling/screaming/violence is normal in my neighborhood. Since the cops were not called that night and there are cuts and scabs all over MIL they have been threatening to press charges. There was a lot of blood when she fell, she hurt her hip bad,  and more stuff among those lines. 

My ex and I are in the beginning process of our divorce, he’s seeing someone new. I think they had something  behind my back beforehand, the more I think about it. They are already expecting. What I feared most that night has already happened and I can’t help but feel hopeless. His girlfriend is 19, I want to tell her about this but I would probably be seen as the crazy ex. I just want to find my own peace and let go of all of this craziness. 

There is my story. I know in my heart I’m not the AH but I can’t help but feel like I am the cause of all of this. I'm sorry for the lengthy post, I’ve rewritten this enough times to not leave any big red flags I never saw before. I still miss my baby everyday, I feel like I will everyday til the day I die. I just feel crazy."
zembdm_5510,zembdm,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Hi yall, I know the title sounds horrible, it is horrible and I never meant for it to happen. My (23F) soon to be ex husband (34M) and I were together for a little over 5 years now. Dated for around a year, married for 4. During these 5 years he had made it very clear that he wanted kids, soon. I had tried to express that I didn’t want any for the time being, which led to him getting upset with me. 

I reluctantly agreed that we would start trying after he set up a nursery with my MIL while I was traveling out of state for my best friend’s wedding. This hurt me a lot. I knew he wanted kids and don’t get me wrong I want kids too! I am still young and we do not need to rush anything. We got into a huge argument and he went to stay with his parents. Since this argument, MIL has not liked me. Before she loved me, if she didn’t I doubt my ex and I would have ever gotten married, he’s a huge mama’s boy. 

I had to beg him to come back home. Everyone I knew was telling me I was making a huge mistake, that I could lose my marriage and that I should “just give in because I want kids anyways.” That argument was mid March this year we weren’t speaking again until early April. This was the first time we’d ever gone so long without speaking, he never checked up on me once. He didn’t answer my calls or text when I sent them, I was worried about him the whole time. I had to go see him in person to make up, in the end we agreed to start trying.

Although we made up before April, MIL refused to invite me over for Easter dinner. MIL invited my ex over though, he went. He left me all alone on Easter. I ended up going out with my friend’s family after they kindly offered, he yelled at me for going.                     

Around May I found out I was pregnant. Ex, MIL, and all of my family were ecstatic, I was the only one who wasn’t. I felt confused about my whole marriage, let alone having kids with him. I let myself get overwhelmed with stress, which caused me to miscarry 2 weeks before my gender reveal. 

When I found out, I was in hysterics. I still am. I stressed out so much over having a baby, it eventually took my baby. He didn’t look at me the whole car ride home. I remember just sobbing as he walked inside the house, I stayed in the car for a while. Until my MIL came over, she was sobbing too. She pounded on the car window and screamed at me.

Never, since we've been together, has he complained about my cooking. He only wants to eat the same things over and over again and refuses to eat anything that isn't those few things he likes. As if he were a little bratty child. I honestly got fed up and stopped trying to please him, all he wants to eat is frozen or fried food. I kept on cooking how I usually do and stopped caring if he likes it or not. Suddenly now he hates spices, likes everything bland or extremely sweet, with chocolate or dulce de leche and the salty foods must be something he can eat with mayonnaise or else he barley touches his food. He wants me to cook more like his mom and he goes over on weekends to bring back Tupperware of left over food for him to eat. 
I cook up a very varied menu but we do however have a budget and our budget doesn't allow for me to cook us different plates for every single meal.
He started loosing weight now since he's refusing to eat and that worries me because he isn't an overweight person, he's very tall and is huge in body proportions, now he has lost a significant amount of unhealthy weight. 
I'm tired of this eating issue and I don't know what to do , I thought that if I ignored it he would eventually stop this stupidity and eat what there is to eat, but he's not eating and it feels like a war and a struggle at meal times.  
I think he's being an absolute bratty AH but maybe I'm also the AH for not feeding him what he wants .

zf9n71_5543,zf9n71,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,"I live in an old house that's been converted to three apartments: one unit on the first floor (along with a community laundry room), one unit on the second floor, and me on the third. All of it is connected by a narrow, wooden walkway and stairs.

My second floor neighbor had a very sweet longhaired dachshund, who is currently sitting beside me on my couch. He's black and brown and his nametag says Peanut Butter Cup (PBC), but I always heard my neighbor calling him ""P"". My neighbor would leave the dog alone most weekdays and upon returning home yell at ""P"" about the the messes he had made. (""YOU PISS ON THE CARPET AGAIN, P!"") Literally every day. But PBC is a little dog, and you can't leave ANY dog alone like that and expect the best.

When my neighbor *is* home, he listens to loud, bassy music, so loud that I feel the vibrations when I'm laying in bed. The landlord knows it's a problem and won't renew my neighbor's lease at the end of February, but anyway, that's all to say that such loud music can't be good for a dog, right?

Also, when my neighbor does walk PBC, he doesn't use a leash. I understand why, PBC is such a sweet dog, but you never know what could happen. We live on a busy street, there are lots of other animals around, and I hate to think what might happen if PBC ended up getting hurt (or worse) for no good reason.

Anyway, I was walking home yesterday evening and someone was in the laundry room. I climbed the stairs and PBC was on the wooden walkway by himself, outside of my neighbor's apartment. I don't know why he was outside, but assume that my neighbor had let him out (off the leash again!) while he was doing laundry.

PBC was happy to see me--his tail whipping around, his head lowered, looking up at me. I said hello, approached him, and he fell to his side for a belly rub. The poor thing's fur was completely matted on his underside and he felt thin. (That might just be a wiener dog thing, but still.)

I stayed on the walkway with him a few moments, scratching him all over. He licked my hand, rolled onto his other side, was such a good boy. It was very relaxing, distracting, so when I heard the laundry room door shut and my neighbor on the stairs, I panicked--almost like I was about to get caught cheating, or something. Whatever the case, I wasn't thinking clearly and snatched up PBC and took him into my apartment. I fed him some leftover chili, which he ate like he was starving.

I love PBC and am not planning to give him back. AITA?

UPDATE: Heard you all loud and clear. Returned PBC to his owner, who listened to my suggestions (get a groomer, puppy pads, use a leash). I feel like my neighbor will do what's right. Good luck PBC. I still love you."

So when the new school year started I sat in chemistry room with anna and we sit girl, girl, Anna, Me, Jacob, guy. And Anna always talks with one of the girls Caron (17 f, the name is not really important ) and she never pays attention in this class or any other. 

So when we do some work. I work and talk with Jacob. We were in the same school friend with J group but we didn't knew each other very well. And I have 3 classes with him (chemistry and English also with Anna, and PE where Anna is not). And we naturally started talking more. 

Anna and Jacob were always close. And I always shipped them. They would be cute together. But she has been saying that she sees him as brother. And one time I met him accidentally after school. And I had time before I had to be somewhere so we talked about everything especially about our sports (judo and swimming). We were out about 1 hour. 

At the time I didn't know she liked him. Now one time she has told me that she had a dream where she was dating him. And I asked her if she likes him multiple times and she said no. And after some pressure from me she said he's cute but that's all. 

And life goes on. And me and Jacob let's say flirt. We push each other. Like if he sees me he punch me in my arm. When we sit together we kick each other. And we exchanged boots (school boots) so he has one mine and I have one of his. I tried to get my back but he didn't want to so I didn't pressure it. 

And yesterday in English we have movable chairs and we were working in a group and Jacob was kicking me. And for a time he rest his feet on mine I didn't mine it. Bc we there wasn't really a lot of room so I was also touching guy next to me. And Anna and Carol noticed.

Anna came to school today and didn't even speak to me. She acted like I was trash. And I tried to talk to her vut nothing. So I asked Carol and she said that I have to talk to Anna but she didn't even want to see me. So I texted her and she ignored me at first so I texted Carol and she said that's she pissed bc of Jacob. And then Anna texted me saying: you know what you did. 

Also I feel it's important to say I have boyfriend. And we talked about him in front of Jacob so they both know I'm taken. I love him and he's my everything ❤but we had a fight today but that has nothing to do with this.

Edit: my boyfriend knows all of this and is totally ok with it. Also we're not strictly monogamous. So flirting doesn't hurt anybody. But anything more serious needs to be talked about. Which I don't want at the moment"

MIL is your standard housewife, she cooks and cleans the house while my husband's stepfather Bob works. Bob is not my FIL, my husband barely acknowledges him. MIL and my actual FIL got divorced after MIL cheated with Bob. MIL and FIL are now on good terms but hubby doesn’t like Bob. Back to MIL, MIL has never really liked me but my husband said we just had something he’d never had before and he wasn’t willing to lose me just because MIL doesn't like me. MIL hated that hubby “chose me over her.” Her words not mine. MIL has done horrible things to try to break us up, after we got engaged MIL tried to set my husband up with a younger woman. Hubs told me immediately and we went NC for a while. 

We went NC up until I got pregnant (late August) she then insisted that we have to come over for Thanksgiving dinner and make the family whole again before the baby arrives. Husband is sketchy about it but I insist on going. I really wanted to be one big family. Husband agrees with MIL that if they get to be ‘one big whole family’ FIL has to come, MIL argued it. Hubby did not want to have FIL alone on a day about family. 

Thanksgiving day rolls around and almost everything is pork, only drinks are alcohol. I am Muslim, another reason she does not like me. Said I was going to convert her son, never have even tried. MIL and Bob rarely even drink, so the excessive amount of alcohol was clearly MIL’s way to mess with me. I obviously refuse to eat or drink anything, Hubby is very upset with MIL. MIL tries to force me to eat claiming she slaved away on this meal. Everyone is getting into a screaming match, MIL is calling me over dramatic and Bob is supporting her. Hubby and FIL are defending me until we just went to FIL’s house where we ate our own meal, much later than we liked but we were happy.

Hubby and I have talked about wanting to go NC again since MIL blew the one chance she had to make this all right again. I agree, once we told MIL she argued that the baby is on the way and that we need to be a big happy family. 

Was going NC too much? As of now hubs and I agreed that we were going to remain NC until baby arrives."

I don’t care about the fact it is on my birthday. What upsets me is that my entire family didn’t care enough to know the date of my birthday or that I was graduating this coming spring even though I have told them several times.

I did not get an undergrad graduation ceremony because it was in 2020 during Covid. I am the first in my entire family to earn a masters degree. My cousin is the star of the family due to her mom being the golden child of my grandparents, therefore, all 3 of her kids have received all of the attention and emotional / financial support whereas I have never gotten the attention that my cousins have gotten their entire life. 

The icing on the cake is that I am about 90% sure that this would have been the day my boyfriend of 5 years was going to propose. Regardless, this is going to be one of the most special days of my entire life and now none of my family (except for my parents) will be there. In fact, I don’t think they would even bother to come if the wedding was on a different date. They have attended all my other cousins high school and bachelors graduations but have never attended any of mine.

zfpasx_5569,zfpasx,top-comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"My boyfriend (23M) invited me (22F) to an event that happens to be one of my favorite things to do. It was a one time opportunity that only happens annually, so I was looking forward to it for weeks. 

The day of the event comes and my bf told me he would pick me up after work, unfortunately his shift ended later than expected so our plans were already a bit messed up, but shit happens and I was still just happy to be able to go at all. When he picked me up, he was on FaceTime with some of his friends/coworkers (18F and 20sF), who had invited us to dinner before we go to the event. He asked me in front of them if I wanted to go, and I didn’t feel as though I had any choice but to say yes, so that’s what I did. It was a restaurant that I couldn’t eat at as it only offered a variety of one thing that happens to make me sick to my stomach, and we only had a very limited amount of time before the event ended, so I was a bit frustrated at this point. 

I told my bf I did not appreciate him putting me on the spot, that I didn’t feel as though I had any actual choice, that we were already late for the event, and I couldn’t even eat at this place. He said nothing today was going as planned, and just brushed me off. I remained quiet for the rest of the ride. By the time we got to the restaurant, our event had 2.5 hours until it was over. 

I had never met these friends before, so the first 5 minutes of the dinner were the girls and I getting to know each other. After that, I was not acknowledged at all, and I was unable to join in on the conversation as they only talked about things that only they knew about (like work and continuing conversations from work). At this point I was fuming, I felt as though my bf chose his friends over our date, and it didn’t seem like he cared at all. For the rest of dinner I sat on my phone and ignored everyone (which wasn’t hard since it seemed they were ignoring me too). I’m sure you guys will probably think that I never tried and seemed angry from the beginning and that’s why they left me alone, but no I genuinely tried to act like everything was okay and interact with them, but it felt like I was unwelcome. 

Once they finally decided it was time to part ways, I immediately got up and walked out of the restaurant without saying anything or waiting for my bf. Once he caught up, I told him there was only an hour until the event ended, which wasn’t enough time to do anything there, and I wanted to go home, I was so hurt and angry that it took everything in me to not to cry. Once we got to my place, I asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said he had nothing to say so we just ended the night there."

It turned out to be a girl. When we told my family they were all excited. Obviously Nicks family was not…they wanted a boy…me and Nick don’t choose the gender. 

Nicks mom decided to throw a early baby shower…it was a shock when me and Nick walked in and we saw blue balloons and everything was blue. We tried to correct everyone but my FMIL didn’t accept it. She said it was a boy so Nick can carry on his family name. 

The baby shower went by fast because there was a bunch of blue gifts…obviously Nicks mom was crying and when she asked why I’m not happy for this…I told her that she is lucky I stayed through the whole baby shower even though the baby isn’t a boy. Everyone was shocked and some were upset. So Nick told the truth that our baby is a girl. Nicks mom cried like a baby….literally. I got mad and started yelling at her and she kept crying. 

Her best friend called me a asshole for this and for not appreciating what my FMIL sacrificed to make this baby shower. I told her that it’s not my fault that she only cares about Nick carrying on the family name. Nick was mad and told his mom that he is going NC with her and the rest of his family because of how they treat me. 

Now, his mom keeps threatening me about calling the cops. I didn’t even do anything…all I did was yell. 

P.S. Nick was recording the conversation when his mom was “crying”. She tends to fake cry. Just like today.

Update: 

I really appreciate everyone taking the time to comment, thank you. I do feel he is being viewed in a different light than reality because I only listed the issue not every area he does well in. I have ASD myself so speak factually and so things can be lost in translation.

He did take a lot on board. Time will tell I am sure but he also has a lot of anxiety and so avoids issues (I’m the opposite so I find this maddening) but fully accepts he is in the wrong. 

He also had an abusive ex partner which did a lot of damage and he lacks a lot of faith in himself. I am choosing to work with my partner on these issues (I am sure many will disagree!) because I do think they fundamentally stem from ADHD and anxiety and not laziness (he is not last in other areas not does he actively try to avoid activity for that reason).

I do think he fails by not working on his issues and I’ve been clear on that as that’s on him. If that doesn’t change I will reassess but it’s only a few months into him knowing he has ADHD and he is struggling with accepting that too. 

And for the guy that messaged me for ‘conversation’ yet is a member of a pregnancy pork group, words fail me! 


Well I’m sat here feeling wretched again, I’m 39 with first pregnancy and had so many issues and I am on liquid morphine for pain.

I’m well into third trimester and never sleep due to reflux and vomiting which can go on until 5am. I’m still working as I’m the breadwinner and I don’t get paid leave.

I cover the majority of rent and all bills and have bought all baby related and pregnancy related things bar one.
I do not mind that generally as I make a lot more than my partner and he is self employed. But he never (once a week maybe) gets to work on time so he could make more. He stays up til 1am on a good night (3am others) just watching rubbish, not sorting anything baby related (I can’t even bend and a load of stuff still in boxes). I have antenatal checks at 7:30/8am that he apparently can’t come to due to work yet didn’t get to work yesterday until nearly 1pm.

I’m so tired of asking him to do basic things and he wants a gold star if he puts the bin out. 

This morning he moaned because I kept him up vomiting all night as he could hear (I get no sleep and he snores like a tractor!), it’s just the last straw I think. He still didn’t leave on time for work yet I had a meeting and I can’t skip work! 

I just feel like I’m doing it all myself and snapped and I am so scared of being in pain forever (I have surgery in March and I’m a disabled doctor so I have loads of issues) and looking after the baby and going back to work after a matter of weeks. 

My family live 4-5hrs away but have offered to come and help, my partner thinks it’s not necessary as he can help but he does the bare minimum and that’s only after I ask ten times or more. 
I feel like I’m the problem now and should just suck it up as he has ADHD and struggles to focus but I don’t know at this point.

I’ve contacted his dad before who did talk to him but he improved for a day. I can’t survive much longer like this. My family are all concerned."

WIBTA to just leave or breakup with my boyfriend?(throw away acct)

i 22 F have been dating 27 M for up to 4 yrs now, he has a child who i am the step mother to. recently, i have had thoughts of leaving my boyfriend, for context, i am just tired of doing everything, i feel like i am a mother 2 kids.

i pay the bills, HIS car insurance i pay for, i even pay for his damn wax for him to smoke... im always doing the cleaning, cooking, letting out the dogs, making sure my boyfriend kid is up and takes a shower and dressed for school. Then i work a 830-5 job i remotely work, but i am always late to due to having to wait for my step-kids mom to pick her up for school (we live about 20 mins away from the school my step-daughter mom wanted her to go to so she picks her up she is usually picking her up by 845 and step-daughter has to be at school by 9am) i also have to let the dogs out and feed them in the morning so i dont even get to work until maybe 9am or later, i have already told work about whats going on and im so very close to losing the job due to my boyfriend just sleeping in and refusing to get his kid ready for school so i can get ready for work. he'll get very mad at me and throw a fit basically if i tell him he needs to get up as he hates getting up in the morning.

Recently i have had the thought of just leaving when my step-daughter is at her moms so she doesnt witness what would end up going down. i love my boyfriend a lot and i love his kid as well, but it is becoming overwhelming and i feel like i have no space to breath, my boyfriend constantly tells me how he wants someone in his life to help relieve his stress and make him happy not put stress on him, so because of that obviously as stated before, i take care of his kid basically while he sleeps in, his daughter gets home around 4-430 pm and so i leave work early (Again my job is not okay with this but his daughter will not leave me alone to work my shift and will constantly ask me to get her stuff even when i am on phone with a customer when i am not suppose to have background noise or other people in the room as i work per my work remote home contract i had signed) to tend to her while my boyfriend stays asleep till maybe 5-530 or later depending how tired he is.

i let out the dogs and feed them because if he does it he complains how he did not want them and wants to get rid of them and how he always has to do it even though hes let them out maybe 5-6 times in our 4 yrs of being together and one of our dogs is a germen shepherd that he WANTED and i had bought for him 3 yrs ago.

i do all the cooking even if my boyfriend is up in the AM, i make his daughters food make myself food then my boyfriend food BUT i dont even eat my food until im done with the dishes and done wiping down the stove and counters. After im done eating and picking up after everyone, i sweep and mop, then i cooking dinner do the same thing i give everyone one else their meals while my plate sits and gets cold as i clean up dinner and clean sweep and mop. why? because if i dont i wont hear the end of it.

i sit here and think about leaving because my boyfriend doesn't do anything refuses to look for a job because he hates doing the application but expects me to do it, as if i enjoy doing the application and apply for him. he refuses to help me a good 97% of the time and when he does help he gets very OCD and tells me how to sweep and mop and then goes off saying how im a terrible cleaner and how he will just do the cleaning then ask if im going to sweep or mop. everyday i wake up stressed out with a headache because im afraid ill be yelled at early AM. im starting to hate living with him and rather live by myself, the funny part is my boyfriend acts all nice and loving towards me and doesn't yell as much when he daughter is not here, but as soon as its his week with his kid, everyday is an argument, i can tell him how much i dont want to argue in front of his kid as i can see how its effecting her, he will ignore it and continue and then tell me how much he hates me and doesn't know why he continues to deal with me and how i never do shit and hes doing everything, i can list to him everything i do and his response will always be ""The women in my opinion should be the one to take care of the kid and do the cooking and cleaning"" he didn't like my response back of ""Then i guess instead of me being the bread winner because you are the man, you should get a job and become the bread winner"" he obviously went off on me for that comment...

As i type this, my mental health has hit rock bottom and continues to spiral down to where? i dont even know at this point, i feel stressed constantly...i want to tell him i want to break up, but i can already tell you guys, this will be his reaction

""There is no breaking up, i am not starting over with someone else, we have been together for 4 years, i thought you loved me and my daughter, you're so selfish always just thinking about your self never thinking about me or my kid, if you leave im just telling my daughters mom she can keep her and her boyfriend can be my kids daddy and ill just drive off somewhere....""

there is more to that as he will try to gas light me then pull me in for a hug to tell me how he loves me and doesnt want to lose me...i stay for the sole reason i have no where to go, due to me paying for everything, i have no money left over to spend on myself or to leave, i have no family to go to and my 1 and only friend, has no room for me until her one tenant moves out and that wont be till end of tax season and if im being honest i dont think im going to last till then....id rather sleep under bridge at this point

even though there is more to this i will stop it here unless asked for my details on anything that is unclear as if i continue id be at my computer for hours typing a story about my life and how crappy is basically is.."

zg94hb_5616,zg94hb,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,"I (21) M have always treasured my birthday as the one day a year where i could decide how I would celebrate it with my family and what we would do as well as having an amazing time all the family together. Although only partially given that i share my birthday with my younger sister however that's never bothered me because i even liked sharing that special day with my sister.

It is true that i have always been kind of possessive with my things and that same attitude has resulted in me getting called childish given my age. But no with material thing but with symbolical things such as this situation in which i may be the asshole.

I have two cousins (1M and 4F) and, like every yooung child they always want to be the protagonists of every family get-together. I am usually okay with all that because they are just children and it is not feasible to want a child to act othewise. My 4 year old cousin usually stands out in this aspect because her parents have always raised her in an enviroment where she always was the most important person, the one who is the best and just very competitive overall. So I knew my birthday was no different. My 4F cousin (lets call her Diana) would want to be the center of attention and have things go a certain way or she would throw a fit. It is true that she is young and that behaviour is expected from kids that age so I don't normally blame her that kind of behaviour she is, after all, a child.

As background it is also important to know that in any family birthday Diana has always wanted to be the one to blow out the candles of the cake (whether ir be her own or no). Normally, the people in my family don't really care and just let her be the one to blow out the candles (either she alone or with the birthday person together). I have always thought that if they didn't my nor did I. However I knew that I wouldn't let her do that in my birthday (normally it is fine because my sister lets her blow her so she usually leaves me alone in that aspect).

But last week we celebrated my birthday and I, because I can't expect a 4 year old to understand that today isn't her day and as such needs to step back for onen day, i let her put whatever music she liked so she could feel special (mind you Let it go at least 10 times in a row) and I was just happy to see her dancing and laughing while imitating Elsa.

Some time later the cake was brought out with the candles lit and my sister was up first to blew her candles. Diana said, as expected, that she also wanted to blow them out so they did it together, then Diana alone (although it was not her birthday but she wanted to do it without my sister) and lastly my sister alone. Then my turnbegan, i sat in front of the cake and the problems arose. This time Diana decided that she wanted to blow out the candles ALONE and FIRST (not together and not a second time alone). I firmly told her that it wasn't possible because it was my birthday so I had to be the one to blow out the candles. I reassured her that after I was done blowing my candles for the first time she could do it as many times as she wanted. However she didn't like that one bit and proceeded to throw a fit throwing herself on the floor and screaming and crying (like any 4 year old would to achieve what they wanted). I stood my ground and told her it wasn't possible. Then my mum and uncle (not Diana's dad) practically had me standing up from the chair so that Diana could have a seat and blew out my candles for the first time in my birthday. Then, and only when Diana had decided that she was done blowing the candles did my family let me have a seat, relit the candles and I blew them out. Know that Diana's parents were silent the whole time not saying a word to their child on how what she wanted wasn't possible or offering, at least, alternatives so that she would stop screaming.

After that, I was very upstet and I let my feelings be known in a very polite and no drama way (just to my parents and uncle, not everyone at the party). I said that I would have liked that, given that it was my birthday, to get to be the first one to blow my candles and make a wish. But all I was met with was angry stares. My parents and uncle all told me that I was childish in wanting to have that over my cousin because she was a child and would not understand so being older i had to let her do those things and not be upset.

My siblings and older cousins all sided with me saying that I had a right to be upset and that, while Diana was not at fault because she would not understan my demands, her parents should have done something to prevent her from blowing out my birthday candles first. So, am I the asshole for getting upset at my 4 year old cousing for blowing my birthday candles?"
zg94hb_5618,zg94hb,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (21) M have always treasured my birthday as the one day a year where i could decide how I would celebrate it with my family and what we would do as well as having an amazing time all the family together. Although only partially given that i share my birthday with my younger sister however that's never bothered me because i even liked sharing that special day with my sister.

It is true that i have always been kind of possessive with my things and that same attitude has resulted in me getting called childish given my age. But no with material thing but with symbolical things such as this situation in which i may be the asshole.

I have two cousins (1M and 4F) and, like every yooung child they always want to be the protagonists of every family get-together. I am usually okay with all that because they are just children and it is not feasible to want a child to act othewise. My 4 year old cousin usually stands out in this aspect because her parents have always raised her in an enviroment where she always was the most important person, the one who is the best and just very competitive overall. So I knew my birthday was no different. My 4F cousin (lets call her Diana) would want to be the center of attention and have things go a certain way or she would throw a fit. It is true that she is young and that behaviour is expected from kids that age so I don't normally blame her that kind of behaviour she is, after all, a child.

As background it is also important to know that in any family birthday Diana has always wanted to be the one to blow out the candles of the cake (whether ir be her own or no). Normally, the people in my family don't really care and just let her be the one to blow out the candles (either she alone or with the birthday person together). I have always thought that if they didn't my nor did I. However I knew that I wouldn't let her do that in my birthday (normally it is fine because my sister lets her blow her so she usually leaves me alone in that aspect).

But last week we celebrated my birthday and I, because I can't expect a 4 year old to understand that today isn't her day and as such needs to step back for onen day, i let her put whatever music she liked so she could feel special (mind you Let it go at least 10 times in a row) and I was just happy to see her dancing and laughing while imitating Elsa.

Some time later the cake was brought out with the candles lit and my sister was up first to blew her candles. Diana said, as expected, that she also wanted to blow them out so they did it together, then Diana alone (although it was not her birthday but she wanted to do it without my sister) and lastly my sister alone. Then my turnbegan, i sat in front of the cake and the problems arose. This time Diana decided that she wanted to blow out the candles ALONE and FIRST (not together and not a second time alone). I firmly told her that it wasn't possible because it was my birthday so I had to be the one to blow out the candles. I reassured her that after I was done blowing my candles for the first time she could do it as many times as she wanted. However she didn't like that one bit and proceeded to throw a fit throwing herself on the floor and screaming and crying (like any 4 year old would to achieve what they wanted). I stood my ground and told her it wasn't possible. Then my mum and uncle (not Diana's dad) practically had me standing up from the chair so that Diana could have a seat and blew out my candles for the first time in my birthday. Then, and only when Diana had decided that she was done blowing the candles did my family let me have a seat, relit the candles and I blew them out.

I looked forward to getting to know Mimo better and building a strong relationship with her. However, later I realized that Mimo was not as kind as I had originally thought, and our relationship deteriorated. I used to hear about mean mothers-in-law and think that Mimo would never act that way, but she eventually started nevering like never before….

Mimo became less friendly and less likely to initiate conversations with me after she made a new friend (Sara).. I didn't mind Mimo's change in behavior at first because I am an introvert and don't enjoy talking too much, but it still made me think and wonder why Mimo was acting this way.

As I mentioned earlier, Sara was a friend of my husband, Peter. They used to spend a lot of time together, but when Peter and I started our relationship, he gave Sara some distance and would rather spend time with me (completely logical, I am his girlfriend). However, Sara did not like this. Before  Sara and Mimo became friends, Mimo really liked Sara for Peter but he didn't like Sara because she had a nasty and mean attitude, and at the time she also had a boyfriend, which Peter respected. Looking back at things Peter told me, I still think Sara had feelings for Peter because she would change around him in a way that seemed like she was trying to make me jealous.

Mimo, Sara and two teenagers (Maria and Sandra) were not happy about my relationship with Peter, because he would spend a lot of time with me and give me more attention. When I arrived in Peter's life, Sara, Maria, and Sandra described it as though they were being ""left out"" because Peter was giving me more attention. I understand that it can be frustrating when a friend drops you for a romantic partner, but these girls were very mean to Peter and fake, and he never said anything because he was an introvert and a people pleaser.

When I saw what was happening I talked to him and told him he shouldn't let people treat him like that, that those are not his “friends”. He told me that he had realized that and that he was distancing himself little by little from them. Our relationship was something he was willing to defend so he started stepping up more for himself. But oh oh, Mimo and her 3 best friends didn't like that and said that “Since she's here, you've changed with us”. 

Sara, Maria, and Sandra were being mean and controlling to Peter. I talked to him about it and told him that he shouldn't let people treat him that way and that those people are not his “friends”. He told me that he had already realized that and was slowly distancing himself from them, so he started standing up for himself more. However, oh oh Mimo and her best friends didn't like that and said that since I arrived in Peter's life, he had changed with them.

Fast Forward to Peter’s brother's birthday (Mark). I took my time to collect pictures of him from when he was born until his birthday.After working on the album for hours, I ordered it and it arrived a few days later. I called Mimo and told her that I was bringing my Mark's present. When I arrived we chatted for a little bit and it was time for Mark to open his present. Mark opened the album, he was happy to see his own pictures on the cover. Mimo read a couple of phrases that I had written in the album and then started talking about making her own album with Sara, without thanking me for the gift. I found this lack of gratitude amusing.

Two days later, my sister called me and asked if I had seen a video that Sara had posted. I was confused because I didn't think anything she would post would interest me. However, to my surprise, the video was little Mark ""ripping"" the album, but the damage was much worse than what a baby could do. Sandra and Maria also posted the video with a laughing emoji. Mimo, who had been present when I was giving the gift, didn't say anything about the videos and acted like she didn't know anything.

After everything they did they even told him that he had to choose between Me or them because they were his “friends” first, and that they didn't understand why he was so distant from them, that they didnt do anything to him so why was he mad and giving them the cold shoulder (hint: you guys ripped a gift my gf gave to my brother and posted it on social media). He told them that the position they put him in, of course he’ll choose me over them any time. 

They tried to make Peter choose between me and them by saying that they were my ""friends first"" and that they didn't understand why I was upset with them (Like they didn't just rip my gift and posted it online). Anyways, he made it clear that he would choose me over them any time. 

Honestly I was disappointed by their lack of remorse and immaturity, especially Mimo, she was supposed to be the bigger person and stop them but instead she was the captain of the boat. I realized that there was nothing more I could do. I decided to let go of my anger and I learned to forgive, even though I didn't forget what had happened. And over time, I was able to move on but then after a year of silence Mimo called my husband to tell him lies about what happened with the book, but never directly talked to me or even apologized about it. So no, I don't think AITA for not wanting to be in contact with my MIL after what she did to me."

My in-laws are obsessed with alcohol and will take any occasion to drink. I am not a big fan of drinking and I don’t really like the taste of alcohol. 

I will drink at a event but rarely. Last year. at my brother-in-laws birthday party my mother and aunt got to drunk and almost ruined his birthday. 

I had to drive them home and was late for a meeting. This year, my husband decided to host thanksgiving and put me in charge. 

I immediately thought of alcohol and decided it would be better if there wasn’t any. When i decided to tell everyone my choice, 

my mother and aunt-In-law were the first to berate me saying i was sucking the fun out of it and there was no point of even going. 

I really didnt see the big deal and it’s not like I just didn’t want alcohol, I just don’t believe they can be trusted with alcohol. 

My husband told me I was being dramatic and ruining everyone’s fun so I want to know, Am I the asshole?"

zh103i_5656,zh103i,op-engaged,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A few months ago, the pastor of my church asked me to go to work for him in the office. I'm a writer and he needed help with a few books he wanted to write. So I went to work for him. There was an office manager, ""Kay,"" who's one of those who thinks she knows more about everything than you do, but I just ignored her and worked on his books. In 8 months, I helped him write six books, publish four and started a seventh book. I also did the press releases, fliers and did all the marketing for him, and he's making a lot of money for his church.

Kay has been getting more and more snarky. For the most part, I have been able to work on the books and get things done. I also did other things around the church whenever asked. I never refused. There's another lady working in the office, who is often the target of Kay's bullying. Just a couple of months ago, I found her sitting in the darkened sanctuary crying because of how Kay had treated her. I went to the pastor AND told Kay that she was in there crying, then went after her myself. I got her to calm down and got her back to work.

Anyway, as I said, the church is making a lot of money from the sales of these books. I didn't charge him what I usually charge for my services - I've only charged him half, which he has already made back from book sales.

Kay has been getting snarkier and snarkier. When I was doing transcription from one of his teaching series for the most recent book, she would stand over me, interrupt me and ask, ""How long is this going to take?"" I told her that if she kept interrupting me, it was going to take longer. Then I heard her tell the other lady that she thought I was ""milking the clock.""

The pastor had asked me to learn the computer systems, so Kay would have a back up. No one else knows how to get into those systems but he's concerned that if she gets sick, no one else would know how to do anything to keep the office running. So I told her that the pastor wanted me to learn the systems. She flat out said she didn't trust me. I was floored. So I told the pastor what she said, and told him that if I can't be trusted, then I shouldn't be working in a church. He said he trusted me and wanted me to learn the system. I told him I would continue working on the books, because she obviously has some kind of problem with me. A few friends have since told me that they think she's jealous, or afraid that I would take over her job. (Believe me, I don't want it.)

Two weeks ago, I was in his office discussing the book we were about to publish and she came storming in. She had gotten hold of the manuscript I had worked on and did something which messed it up. Then she was screaming at me because the manuscript was messed up! I yelled back and asked her why she put her hands on it in the first place, because she wasn't supposed to touch it. She also made some remark that she was trying to ""fix"" something because I was never doing anything except ""twiddling my thumbs."" The Pastor was appalled and yelled at her to stop acting like that. She screamed at me that she had been there until 1130 the night before trying to fix it. I yelled back at her that she's staying late EVERY night and not to put that off on me. I also told her if she'd stay off her cell phone, stop texting and stop getting involved in everyone else's business, she'd have time to do her own work and get off on time. She stormed out and I told the pastor that I was going to leave for the day, because I was about to say something I would not be sorry for.

The next day, he had a meeting with each of us. Kay had already cried on the other lady's shoulder about the outburst. (The other lady had been doing some shopping for office supplies, so she wasn't  even there for Kay's performance.) She jumped all over me, telling me that things were somehow MY fault. I told her she needed to get her nose back in joint where it belonged and told her what had happened. She went on to defend the abusive behavior and said that I needed to ""understand that's just how Kay is, and that's her personality."" I told her that I was not going to accept abusive behavior and her personality sucked. Then the pastor talked to all three of us separately and told me that I had to ""be the bigger person."" I told him that being the bigger person too often translated to ""silently take the abuse."" I told him that I'm not willing to put up with that kind of abuse. I told him I will gladly work on his books, but I'm not going to be working on them from the office, and will instead work on them from home. He said the three of us were going to have a meeting about it. I said, ""Have all of the meetings you want. But I'm saying right now, she will NOT EVER talk to me like that again.""  I told him to let me know what arrangements he wants to make for his remaining books to be done and he knows how to get hold of me. I left the office and haven't been back. The only thing I'm glad about is that she did her little screaming fit in front of the pastor, so he knows exactly what happened.

I left no doubt in anyone's mind that I'm not going to submit to being screamed at, falsely accused of anything, belittled or lied about. Keep in mind that I didn't ask for them job - he asked me to come in and work on his books. I haven't gone to any services there since then, either.

AITA for walking out?

 UPDATE: I still haven't heard from the pastor, who hasn't responded to either the finished manuscript, nor to my email or text. So that's fine. BUT...I have received a call from an old colleague from my days in law enforcement. He's retired now and went to work for Homeland Security. He has been put in charge of a local office and was given a free hand to hire whomever he wants. And he contacted ME! I start with him next week. Isn't it strange that Kay doesn't ""trust"" me, but Homeland Security does? Oh yes, I'll be making twice as much money with him, so that's going to be a nice additional income along with my ghostwriting fees. Thank you to everyone who cared enough to read and comment. Your support is greatly appreciated. I was feeling pretty low, but your kindness was a great boost. "

I also told her if she'd stay off her cell phone, stop texting and stop getting involved in everyone else's business, she'd have time to do her own work and get off on time. She stormed out and I told the pastor that I was going to leave for the day, because I was about to say something I would not be sorry for.

The next day, he had a meeting with each of us. Kay had already cried on the other lady's shoulder about the outburst. (The other lady had been doing some shopping for office supplies, so she wasn't  even there for Kay's performance.) She jumped all over me, telling me that things were somehow MY fault. I told her she needed to get her nose back in joint where it belonged and told her what had happened. She went on to defend the abusive behavior and said that I needed to ""understand that's just how Kay is, and that's her personality."" I told her that I was not going to accept abusive behavior and her personality sucked. Then the pastor talked to all three of us separately and told me that I had to ""be the bigger person."" I told him that being the bigger person too often translated to ""silently take the abuse."" I told him that I'm not willing to put up with that kind of abuse. I told him I will gladly work on his books, but I'm not going to be working on them from the office, and will instead work on them from home. He said the three of us were going to have a meeting about it. I said, ""Have all of the meetings you want. But I'm saying right now, she will NOT EVER talk to me like that again.""  I told him to let me know what arrangements he wants to make for his remaining books to be done and he knows how to get hold of me. I left the office and haven't been back. The only thing I'm glad about is that she did her little screaming fit in front of the pastor, so he knows exactly what happened.

I left no doubt in anyone's mind that I'm not going to submit to being screamed at, falsely accused of anything, belittled or lied about. Keep in mind that I didn't ask for them job - he asked me to come in and work on his books. I haven't gone to any services there since then, either.

AITA for walking out?

 UPDATE: I still haven't heard from the pastor, who hasn't responded to either the finished manuscript, nor to my email or text. So that's fine. BUT...I have received a call from an old colleague from my days in law enforcement. He's retired now and went to work for Homeland Security. He has been put in charge of a local office and was given a free hand to hire whomever he wants. And he contacted ME! I start with him next week. Isn't it strange that Kay doesn't ""trust"" me, but Homeland Security does? Oh yes, I'll be making twice as much money with him, so that's going to be a nice additional income along with my ghostwriting fees. Thank you to everyone who cared enough to read and comment. Your support is greatly appreciated. I was feeling pretty low, but your kindness was a great boost. "

She doesn't work full-time, and I don't ask her to. She doesn't have to work, kids are grown. My Salary covers us. I am a bit of a slob, but and do not pick up after myself well. We often argue about me not helping out around the house.  I agreed to couples therapy. We began couples counseling with a therapist who serves as my wife's therapist.I began to help out around the house. We then argue over the simplest sh\*t and she seems to pick a fight with me often. What ever the new issue is, I fix it. Not sharing cooking duties? Done. Not picking up after myself? Working hard on it, but basically done. Not doing date night? Date night is back on. Cuddling sometimes, I'm doing it. We have a big argument over me not seeking therapy. (She yells at me sometimes. I usually don't respond. When I yell back, she says that I need anger management therapy.) The day after we argue, we go to our regularly scheduled therapy session. We each tell the therapist about our argument. The Therapist pretty much ignores what I said and asked my wife straight up does she want to separate or get a divorce. I'm floored. Then my wife says ""I want to separate and maybe divorce."" The therapist says to me Let me talk with Becky first and then you can come back and talk with me. I said ""f\*ck no, "" I'm outta here. I leave and come back the next day we argue more and then we apologize and makeup. A few days pass and I tell my wife that I want a new therapist because this one put the divorce on the table for no reason and I felt like since it was her therapist, they talk about divorce behind my back. My wife admitted that in their session they spoke about it. I told my wife it was a conflict of interest and that I want a new therapist. My wife told me that I'm being unreasonable and there is no reason to change. AITA?"

Recently, I spent the weekend with my boyfriend and his family and on the first night we got into a drunken argument where he snapped and yelled at me. I did not yell back, but I cried. My boyfriend was so loud and heated that his father intervened and offered to drive me home. My boyfriend apologized and I ended up staying, but the next day his stepmother took me aside and told me in private that she was disgusted at the way he spoke to me, called him TRASH, said that I could do so much better and to leave him. I agreed that I did not deserve to be spoken to like that but I was also shocked and that she had such harsh words to say about him. She never confronted him about how he treated me and acted completely normal for the rest of the visit. Am I the asshole for feeling compelled to tell him?! He drove me back to my place and spent the last night with me and it bothered me so much that I told him she did not like the way he spoke to me and told me to leave him (I omitted the part where she called him trash!) I asked him not to confront her because I didn’t want to start any drama, it just bothered me so much I had to get it off of my chest. He was furious, called his father the next morning, and didn’t speak to his step-mother for several days.  Now his father and step-mother avoid me… I understand how she could feel betrayed but WTF? Should I have kept it to myself? I feel kind of sad that I don’t have a relationship with her anymore… is it salvageable? And do I really even want a relationship with her when she thinks so poorly of my boyfriend? Should I tell him everything she said or would that make me even more of an instigator??"

Two months after my child was born I realized that he was never going to provide for my child the way she needed. He never bought a thing before she was born and I worked constantly. I tried breaking up with multiple time, a few days would go by then he would ask to see our child. I would bring her to him and he would try to get me back.
After realizing he was a deadbeat I got full custody and child support. I only wanted full custody so he could not continue to use my child to manipulate me. He has no money so I never expected child support. I only wanted to cut my losses and keep my sanity. After all of this I found out he got my Ex-best friend pregnant. The friend and I did not end on bad terms, but we grew apart. I later found out she was jealous and obsessed but I blocked her and moved on with my life. 

About 8 months later her got arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail. His mother maintains a relationship with her grandchild. The problem is she continues to push him into our lives. She says he’s a changed man and asks me to bring our child to see him in jail. She also asked me to accept his calls. I accepted two of his calls the first month he was in jail. It would go like this:
Him: “Hey wyd?”
Me: “Leaving work”
Him: “You’re probably not at work, you fucking bitch. You’re a hoe, you need to be taking care of my kid.”
Me: *hangs up and blocks him”
After that I blocked him and focused on rebuilding my life.
His mother also asks that my child meet his other child. I refuse bc he has not met his other child unless it was behind glass. and who’s to say he won’t get out and neglect them both! I also feel like having a father in and out of your life causing more problems during the teenage years. And me being the only parent who accepted the responsibility, I would have to play clean up for the rest of my life. I would let him in her life if he showed ANY redemption at all. When he had the option to be anywhere in the world, he still chose not to be in her life. Now that he is miserable and alone he wants to be a Dad? He’s met our child but never bothered to build a relationship, so our child doesn’t know they have a dad. I would have a different perspective if he built a relationship with her.
I am young and beautiful and would rather find an amazing stepfather to step up to the plate and be the example she needs. I am sos sorry I have my child a terrible dad, but I will  not let him traumatize her because they share DNA. Also I have a feeling he will just keep having kids and I don’t want my child to feel like they are apart of a matching set with a half ass parent. The situation is so messy I’d rather explain when my child is 18 and already grown up in a nontoxic environment. His mother guilt trips me all the time. She says he was young but I was baby and still had enough sense not to ABANDON my child!! What if my child wants to talk to their father. Do I tell them the jail is only open on Sundays? 
I feel like if I let him back in our lives Ill show my child that it is okay for men to come in and out of your life as they please. My family is upper middle class and although my parents eventually divorced they maintained a healthy environment for me. Also I NEVER had to visit anyone in jail. So, reddit am I the asshole?
also 3 years into his sentence her had his sister relay a message to me, and he is still just as toxic and does not accept responsibility."

I arrive home after a walk... I bring a donut for myself, spouse, and child. I disperse said donuts and then take out my cinnamon caramel donut in the kitchen which leaves cinnamon sugar dust on the counter... husband mentions he has been up all night cleaning and asks me to clean up after myself... as I have a mouthful of donut... and upon finishing the donut while still standing in the kitchen wipe up the dust...
 
*a few moments later* 

I walk into the bedroom and find one of those little paper things that you pull off of a breath right strip that you put on your nose which spouse leaves everywhere... all the time... they never find a trash can. 

I show him the little paper and ask politely that he also clean up after himself and put this in trashcan.... 

He says to me then... ""I knew you were going to say something about that this morning, and I am going to lose my shit if you say anything to me about that because I stayed up all night cleaning and I am not going to clean up after myself until the house is fully clean and you &amp; child clean up after yourselves."" 

... I attempt to point out that for the house to be fully clean that all of us must be picking up after ourselves... 

this is met with ire and me being told to ""shut the fuck up"" and to stop talking to him... which I do because there is no point in trying to have any sort of conversation at this point. 

So... because he was up late cleaning and I asked him simply to pick up after himself when he had just 5 minutes before asked me to clean up after myself... AITAH?"

zi5qfn_5701,zi5qfn,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,"Let's get this straight right off the bat. My sister is a selfish person who always expects others to do things for her. She never thinks about her actions or how they might affect other people. She has a history of making selfish and manipulative demands on those around her. Despite all of this, she somehow always manages to play the victim and make it seem like everyone else is in the wrong. She's the kind of person who always wants something for nothing and never takes responsibility for her own actions. At least this is my perspective having known her all my life. I know I might be biased here but here is a personal example that might show what I mean. 

One time, my sister asked me to babysit her kids while she went out of town for the weekend. I agreed, even though I had a lot of work to do and wasn't really looking forward to it. When she came back, she not only forgot to thank me but also demanded that I pay her for the privilege of watching her kids. She said that since I was making money from my job, I should be able to afford it. I was shocked and offended, but she just shrugged it off and acted like it was no big deal. 

My sister is in desperate need of a kidney transplant, but I'm not sure if I want to donate one of mine. She's been begging me for months and I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm just not sure if I'm ready to undergo surgery and take on the risks and potential complications especially given her manipulative nature and ungrateful attitude. I feel really guilty for not wanting to help her, but I also have to think about my own well-being. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole for not wanting to donate a kidney to my sister?"
zi7nkj_5706,zi7nkj,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"TW: SEXUAL ABUSE/CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE 

So recently, my mother decided for some reason to go into my room when I was at my dad's house and read a journal that I've had for nearly 10 years and then tear it up. I'm 24 but I have autism so I'll admit that my maturity level is more like a teenager. She said she was very hurt and upset and called me names because I ranted about her and the things she does/how she treats me in the journal. 

She also found out that I was sexually abused from 10 years old to 19 by a man that she tried to push me into dating (when he was 18 or 19 and I was middle school). She has decided that she's going to keep having him around because he's like a son to her. She still invites him for game nights, she invited him for Thanksgiving and sometimes just for dinner. It makes me very angry, resentful and hurt that he's still around but I'm torn on whether or not I really have the right to be. I've seen a lot of replies on other posts here saying that no one has any right to tell someone who they can and can't be around and I do agree with that and I guess that's kind of what I'm doing here. I also live in her house and dont pay rent and I know that she has the right to have whoever she wants over. On the other hand, I feel like it's an exception because of what he did and the fact that she's my mother. 

She said I had no right to be upset about anything after what I wrote in my journal about her, which I did write some mean things when I was younger. It was mostly that I don't like her and I hate that she treats me like I'm 2 years old but she treats my siblings differently and that I think she's crazy sometimes. No one else knows anything about this or that I was abused and I'm afraid to tell anyone I know because it would cause a lot of problems and my mother would most likely kick me out or get way worse and I can't live on my own yet. 

I'm not trying to sound like a brat, controlling or entitled or anything. I'm sorry if it comes across that way and please let me know if I'm being a brat so I can stop. I just needed some other perspectives because all I can think of is how upset I am by it right now and I can't talk to anyone in person about it.

Edit: I can technically live with my dad, the only issue is I wouldn't have a room. He's already got 7 people in a 3 bedroom house. I'm going to work on saving the money to get my own house or apartment, probably with some roommates."

We had a super stressful holiday season last year and have had issues with my family ever since. Instead of putting ourselves through another hectic Christmas, we decided to go home for Thanksgiving instead. Mix it up.  We told everyone then that we wouldn't be back for Christmas and they all understood because it's a long drive. We all understood that we wanted to enjoy a stress-free holiday season. That was until my sister found out that her husband had received relocation orders and they were moving across the country soon after the new year. 

My family assumed I would change my plans since my sister was going to be moving, but I didn't. I still wanted a stress-free Christmas, and I had just made the trip for Thanksgiving, so I told my mother again that we would not be coming home. She did not take it well and accused us of being dramatic and selfish for not coming. Even tried to use the fact we won't get to see our nieces and nephew for a while to guilt us into changing our minds.

Don't get me wrong, im sad that I'm not gonna get to see the kids this year! But they know I love them, and we always have facetime calls. Plus, they are going to be so busy getting ready to move that they won't have time to visit with me anyway.

Unless I change my mind, my mother is probably going to give me a guilt trip until New years. Am I The Asshole for not changing my plans?"

ziqldc_5741,ziqldc,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"This whole situation is very long and do not know where to start. I F26 am Hispanic who is married to M28 White. We been married for two but been together for 11 years. How this whole situation started 4 days ago with have a phone call with my sister. We were having a very long conversation since it’s been a while since the last time I spoke to her, my husband and I are currently traveling around Europe couple of months now to seriously consider moving there. As I was talking to my sister (I forgot how his mother got brought up) that I have discomfort feelings about his mother. For one I have ran into issues with her in the past where I am feeling and believing she is somewhat racist towards Hispanics. There one incident where last 2021 during when Covid vaccine were being distributed in the United States, his mother called him telling him how she saw in the news (fox’s news) that Mexican people who live in Mexico are crossing the border to get the vaccines and that they are immigrants. Of course my husband got upset with her telling her how she didn’t do her research on the matter that they are also American citizens who live in Mexico, my mother who has her citizenship in both United States and Mexico. His mom was doubling down about it still and he was having to argue back and forth with it until she finally told him she sorry. But once I heard that it honestly didn’t sit right with me and me feel uncomfortable that she had said that openly without considering that her son is married to a Hispanic woman. The second incident was when I invited to his mother to my sister’s graduation party at my mother’s house and everything was oh okay until when the party was over and I was helping my mother clean up outside and I having a conversation with my mother in Spanish since my mother is comfortable is Spanish (she does know English but when her children come home to visit we are expected to speak spanish because she prefer Spanish over English which I do not mind) and we caught up because at that time I lived in Arizona and my mother lives in California, as we were taking his mother comes up to us interrupted that conversation and said for word “If you want me to help, you need to speak English” in the moment I am not joking where I say I felt so disgusted by what she said. I was hurt by what she said that after next day I told my husband about the situation and at first he was making excuses for his mother by saying “she was only trying to help” but after telling that I am not oh ok with someone telling me or my mother to speak English in a Spanish household. And he finally agree that he would have a talk with his mother but when I heard the phone conversation when he confronted her she would lie saying she didn’t say it and then turn it into excuses where she expects that other household should speak English and then finally she said sorry. But it’s not taking accountability is what hurts me even after when I decided to confront about it at her apartment with my husband she started to cry making excuses even though she said sorry it still felt as though she didn’t consider what I feeling and why I was hurt (this incident took place May 2022)

Now back to where I called my sister 4 days ago and as was telling her my discomforting feeling about his mom that is where she confessed to me that both my mom and his mom made plans for her to go the Mexico trip this coming month (January 2023) and it was going to be a surprise. I was in shocked and hurt, I felt so lied to making this kinda plans behinds both myself and my husband backs. I also having my family in Mexico over 12 plus years and very stress seeing them. I told my husband about finding out and he was upset but then said “it is what it is the plans have been made” and we have been fighting for the last four days now. I told his my reasons why I don’t feel comfortable being on board about his mom going to Mexico I would have gotten over it if it was some other place but Mexico is where I feel the most uncomfortable. My husband is not fully supportive about my decision telling his mom that she should not go. It breaks my hurt because I feeling as though how I feel about the situation is not validated or just I have to feel discomfort on my own during the time in Mexico. 

My whole life as long as I can remember I grew up where anything I said about how I feel was completely disregarded that my feelings are not valid and I need to put it off to the side and only care about what others feel. And if I’m being completely honest I been feeling since high school telling myself over and over again “if no one cares how I feel or my feelings are wrong then why I don’t matter anymore why am I here (in this world) why am I here if no one cares how I feel” I been battling back and front since high school about suicidal thoughts. I have in past gotten counseling and seen multiple therapist but I recognize that I need to see a therapist again soon. To be honest the only reason why held myself back from going even a darker place about it is because of my husband he was the only one giving a reason to live but now even I’m starting to not get the support from him about my feelings about the situation with Mexico how he half understands me but the other half is on everyone’s feelings that she should just go. 

Im honestly just lost for words in the since that as right now I don’t feel anyone cares what I am feeling and not wanting to support me and at this point I would rather be lock up in a suicidal watch or just cut everyone out of my left and be alone until I die. As of right now I do not want to go to Mexico anymore or talk/see my mom and my mother in law for a long time. I’ll try to update if anything changes."

My mother has wanted to travel to The UK for decades but has never had the oppertunity to really do it. Approaching her retirement and wanting to start crossing things of her bucket list she decided this is the year she sees London, England. However, my Father [63M] is Deathly afraid of flying and is stubborn as an Ox. My fathers answer to my mother was a firm ""NO"", this absolutley shattered my mothers dreams. After hearing my mother upset i told her that ""If she cant find someone else to go with her, i will"". Elated at this, she proceeded to book the tickets. 
My mother also adores my Girlfriend, Constantly thinks of her and tries to include her in everything posssible.

Realization:
I Realize i did not discuss this decision with my girlfriend, had i known the timeline between having the conversation with my mother and booking flight tickets was going to be less than a week i would have. I also could have been a little less blunt in telling her that i would be doing this ( The feeling this situation was going to go nuclear gave me anxiety so i kind of just tried to ""rip off the bandaid"")

Arguement:
It went Nuclear.... I said i was sorry for the whole situation and i explained everything to her . Her stance is basically she wanted to go to london for a long time too and despite us planning to book a trip this year ( all inclusive i was looking at booking is a week in Jamaica on a 5 Star Resort that she would not have to pay a dime for as i collect air miles and becauseni want to). shes still upset that she wont get to experience a international flight for the first time with me and emphasiszing that im going to Europe without her even tho she has expressed she wants to go aswell. (Im spending a week in london with my mother doing all the Tourist things) My mother is literally paying for eveything on this trip the only reason we have not booked a trip to the UK or europe is my gf is not exactly in the best finicial position and i can not book a trip to europe for 2 for how i would like to experience it at this time. Let me add that her father is notoriously ""Old School"" i have tried my best to respect him and its only the last Year the he has allowed my gf to spend an overnight weekend with me. 
Basically we are at the point where she needs time away to think and focus on herself. Aswell as experiencing things for herself. We are not broken up but i cant help get the feeling she will resent me for this. This a a Person i have told i want to spend the rest of my life with multiple times, i even bought a ring and was planning to propose this year. 

Ps. I wouldnt really consider myself a ""Mommas boy"" i havent been very nice to my mother in the past and the reality is if i didnt hear her cry or know just how much this trip means to her i would have never offered. All im saying is i could be a better son.

Well recently, my sister came over while my husband took the kids and my nieces and nephew to a fun house. 

My sister and her husband are both lower class. They are amazing parents but can’t afford to get their kids very extravagant toys all of the time.

The topic got into christmas and we started talking about what we got everyone. When it got to me to tell what i got for my kids, I showed her the gifts that were already wrapped.

I wanna put in that my kids do believe in Santa still, so I put some gifts with the label “Santa”.

My sister pointed out the big pink present with the Santa label and asked what it was. 

I told her it was a barbie dream house my daughter had been asking for.

She made a sour face and said I need to change the label of the gift because her kids and many others wouldn’t be getting gifts like that from Santa.

I didn’t really understand what she meant so I told her I wouldn’t be changing anything.

She got defensive and said I was wrong because kids that are less fortunate won’t be getting expensive gifts for Santa, and it will make them and the parents feel bad.

But still, I stuck with my decision because I didn’t see anything wrong with it.

She got mad and left my house. When my husband came back home he put the kids down for a nap and I explained the situation to him. 

He said he understood were she was coming from because kids that come from less fortunate family’s won’t be getting barbie dream houses from Santa.

He said I should change it but he won’t be mad or upset if I don’t. My sister went to family about it and people are telling me that I need to change the label so my nieces don’t get jealous.

He would steal from her. He would cuss out her friends. Her mom finally found out this year. Although I find it hard to believe that she was THAT oblivious all these years. And I fully believe that her mom failed my cousin as a mother. My parents have been allowing my uncle to come to family gatherings. My Nana refused to come to Thanksgiving because he was there. And I left Thanksgiving early to go be with my in-laws. That's where I'll be Christmas evening. I'm still spending the morning with my parents and brothers. Bur around 3pm I'll be at my in-laws far away from my uncle. My Nana and maternal uncle refuse to be there as well. My parents say that they don't want to make things worse for my aunt and cousin and kindness will heal his soul through God. I'm no longer religious and don't believe that a 60 year old narcissistic abuser will ever change. I think my parents are just enabling his behaviors and making things worse in the long run. My cousin will be escaping him early next year. But for now, I don't want to be any where near him. I'm a paranoid bipolar schizophrenic with psychotic tendencies. I have imagined already many ways that monster can die. And I don't want to be angry on Christmas. So I will go drink wine with my in-laws and play with my nieces and nephew instead.

Me and my sister used to be really close when we were kids to our teens and because of how close we were I used to always do her hair for her, it was a bonding of sorts. I have always been pretty distant with my family especially my (30m) brother however my sister was always really close with him ever since they were teens, we all struggled with a troubling upbringing because our parents weren’t well of at all and used to pick favourites my brother was always my mums blue eyed boy and I was the wicked witch of the west to her I supposed that caused me and my mum to never fully bond 

Now to the problem or sorts my older brother has been pretty distant with my family for a few years since I told my parents that he m*lested me as a kid,the earliest memory I have of him touching or doing something to me was when I was 5 I’m not going to get into it but it lasted a few years before he stopped out of the blue, all these years later I’m still going to therapy and I still have nightmares, my sister never believed me when I told her she slapped me and called me a liar and since then it’s been minimal contact between me and her 

Now where the problem starts a few days ago my sister phoned me and told me that she was getting Married (which I knew) and she asked me to do her hair when she first asked me I was over the moon we scheduled a date where we were going to meet up and discuss what she wanted so I could try and figure out if I could do it, she was supposed to come to mine so we could look at some photos and stuff 

So this morning I hear a knock on the door and I open it to see my sister and my brother standing there my first thought was to slam the door in their faces but I couldn’t move I was just standing still, I guess they took that as a come on in as they both walked in and I was still standing in the doorway for a few moments before I gathered my bearings and closed it but when I turned to look at them I swear everything Inside of me froze when I saw those eyes I had never wanted to see again staring back at me 

I didn’t really register what I was doing until I had slapped him in the face and I could feel myself sobbing, next thing I knew my sister was pulling me off of him while I was punching his face over and over and again while sobbing during all of the commotion I must have elbowed my sister in the face because her nose was all bust up 

My sister and brother left before anything else happens and I called up my sister a few hours earlier to tell her that I wasn’t going to be doing her hair and I would appreciate it if she never spoke to me again 

Half of my family are on my side and the other half are saying I was wrong because my brother has learned his lesson and was trying to apologise for what happened and I was completely out of line for being physical and busting up my sisters face before her wedding  

So AITA (throwaway account)


Update I suppose

I have ordered a ring doorbell camera and have changed my locks also blocked my sister and some family off of everything I am also arranging legal action with an attorney.

My sister and brother left before anything else happens and I called up my sister a few hours earlier to tell her that I wasn’t going to be doing her hair and I would appreciate it if she never spoke to me again 

Half of my family are on my side and the other half are saying I was wrong because my brother has learned his lesson and was trying to apologise for what happened and I was completely out of line for being physical and busting up my sisters face before her wedding  

So AITA (throwaway account)


Update I suppose 


I don’t really have time to reply to all of the messages and comments but thank you so much for all of the positivity and support

And again thank you so much for any support it is more appreciated than u know"

It’s usually only about 500.00 bucks but this year it was 2500. When she wrote the check she explicitly asked if he would be splitting it with me to which he said yes. Today he deposited the check and I asked how he planned on dividing it between us and he reluctantly said idk how much do you want?  I was going to give you 500. I was a bit surprised and a bit upset considering it’s 2500 and at the moment I won’t be working because my mom is having surgery and I’ll be her only care taker for about a month and I still have to pay my partners and my bills (household like electric, water, food, etc) even though I’m not even going to be home for a month. I didn’t even question doing that since he pays all of rent. It seemed fair. Anyways I got visibility upset which I regret and just abruptly said you don’t have to give me anything if you don’t want. I admit it seemed pretty greedy of me which  don’t think I am. If it were me in his position (makes good money, Im currently in between jobs and working part time when I do work since I’ll be going back to school soon) I would have given him half or at least a grand. I know that’s what I would do and I shouldn’t expect others to behave how I would. Idk AMTAH? (To be clear he’s not an asshole lol) there are more intricacies but I’ll spare you.

For some backstory I was adopted at age 5 as the youngest of three so my mom never got the baby stage of her kids. It feels like she thinks of herself as my child’s parent and when I try to set boundaries she says I’m being too restrictive. As it is flu and RSV season I have asked family and friends to get the proper vaccines but she seems reluctant. She also said if she wants to kiss my baby she can. For context my mom wants to be called mama Mia as a grandma but I just found out if you translate it from Italian to English it means “my mother” and she is now insisting that my dad be called “papa” which is what my husband wants to be called (my dad wanted to be Opa or Opa jr.) On top of that my mom is bipolar schizophrenic who has had to be on meds since 2013 and likes to just randomly stop taking them which has previously put her and other family (myself included) into dangerous situations. Because of this I’m worried about leaving my baby with her. 

Regarding my husband’s family we lost his dad in June and have been trying to be more inclusive of his mom as she sees our soon to be newborn as heavens blessing during this time. My mom though has been excluding her from baby showers and gender reveals and anything else to do with the baby (regarding planning). 

So now my question is how do I protect my child and how do I put my foot down with my mom when she won’t listen?!

However, he’s been going out and doing it A LOT recently with a group of people. I don’t really feel okay with group smoking yet bc of the experiences he’s had with it.

I don’t want to go into detail but I lost my best friend over it and it ended our relationship for a good amount of time. There were bad things done to him that I don’t think he’s really worked through but I give and gave him space to tackle it how he needed. Needless to say the whole situation traumatized me a little.

Recently he’s gotten into a new smoking group. I say he shouldn’t base friendships on smoking and he should have good solid friends that he can talk to and go out with so by no means is this me wanted to isolate him. I just really don’t like this idea of him group smoking especially after he’s lied to me twice ab him going out with them. Like pretended to fall asleep on the phone to sneak out and go smoke.

Am I the a hole

In case you’re invested:
- I want him to be successful in life and not have to rely on smoking to take an edge off *I think professional help and healthy coping mechanisms would be better*
- we’ve discussed that I don’t feel comfortable with the group smoking 
- he’s invested in making me more comfortable with it so sometimes he takes me with him on the phone to go smoke with them

I (21M) live on a street with a few neighbours and our parking spaces are located at the front doors to our houses in the driveways. My space is technically a public space meaning anyone can park there and there has been a few instances where I’ve had to find another parking space due to people parking there. I don’t mind this, most of the neighbours are nice enough and understand that I normally park there and I’ve even had neighbours knock on my door when their guests are leaving to let me know the space is free.

However, due to this being a public space it’s located in between my house and my next door neighbours house. This neighbour has a habit of complaining over anything, for the past 7 years I’ve lived at that house she’s admitted to my grandmother she’s complained about other neighbours and even tried to complain about our dogs saying they constantly bark at night when they don’t as we wouldn’t be able to sleep if they did.

Anyway back to the main situation. I leave for work at 6:50am. In the autumn months to around 2 weeks ago I only ever opened my drivers door and the boot when preparing to leave in the mornings.

However, due to the ice and waking up to an icy car I’ve had to open more doors. My routine goes as follows: open drivers door, start engine to turn on my heated windscreen, shut drivers door and open the boot to grab my de-icer and shut this again. Then I go about deicing my car. Once this is complete (around 10 minutes later) I open my boot but away my de-icer and scrapper and get into my car and drive away.

Yesterday, my neighbour complained to my gran while I was at work saying I opened and closed my doors too much in the morning and I should be considerate of the neighbours as it has woken her up. My gran did mention the fact that it may not be me as she was never woken by this to which my neighbour confessed she knows it’s me as she watched me one morning after being awoken.

My gran told me to just keep doing what I do but I feel kind of like an asshole if it’s woke her up.

Thanksgiving Day, and the adults are in chill mode. Dominoes, spades, drinking, shit talking. The conversation moves on to Kevin Samuels (a story for another time) and the devil that is SINGLE MOTHERS. Even worse, single mothers, and the simps who love them. 

Cousins Shane and Stanley (both male, 30s) POV:

""Only a simp would raise someone else's kids""
""She should've chosen better""
""Russell Wilson is a simp! He's raising Future's son""
""This is why we date out. No man wants to be a step-dad. Black women have too many kids!""

Cousin Scarlet and I, who are both single mothers; however, I'm married and she's dating (30s, female) POV:

""You don't have to date a single mother; but why shame them?""
""Love can cause us to ignore red flags; but let's not act like toxic, manipulative people wear badges proclaiming it""
""There's no single mother without a single father. One parent took accountability, and stayed to raise the child""

""A man who steps in to cherish someone's children as his own is a good man. Not better, but a good man

""Yes, there are too many children being born into unstable family structures. They should know. Most of us grew up in fatherless homes. We know the feeling of being without that TV dad to play catch with us. We saw those ""get a dad"" TV movies and wanted a dad. How can they trash a man who fulfilled that child's wish? ""

The men called us emotional; and they brought up lions killing unrelated cubs. Scarlet and I responded with animals that rescue, nurse and adopt other species. 

Then, it got personal. Shane said that I was ""just lucky that I found a man to simp for me (he adopted my daughter) and be ""Captain Save a 304"". I told Shane that he was just bitter because he was too ugly and too dumb of a child for anyone to want to be his real dad, or his step-dad. I told him not even the football coach wanted to be his father figure. 

I guess I hit a nerve. Shane showed away from the table and went for a walk. Stanley told me I hit below the belt and went after Shane. Scarlet said she was with me until I essentially called Shane a bastard. I reminded her that we all are, and Scarlet said it's different for a man, and that I changed being a single mother with marriage; he couldn't help his father leaving.

zlc0w1_5856,zlc0w1,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,I 16F was dating 17M for 5 months. At the beginning of the relationship I was not allowed over at his house because he said his house was needed to be cleaned. When he said it needs to be cleaned I thought he meant like it just a messy house and that it just looked lived in. I told him a little while in that I didn't mind his house being messy and I wouldn't judge. He finally let me over and the first thing I noticed when he opened his front door was the smell. I literally almost threw up. The entrance of the house wasn't that horrible but when you went downstairs it was disgusting the floor was covered with garbage and dishes with moldy food still in it. Same thing went you went upstairs. The floor every was about a foot high and you didn't sink in the garbage it was so packed you just walked on top of it. The bathroom was disgusting the toilet was never flushed and the door couldn't even close cause of the garbage. Later on I used to try to clean the house but I couldn't even try that much cause with the mix of it all was animal pee and poop. I also was the only one feeding the 9 and 10 year old. When I went over and asked if they were hungry they would say yes and say we haven't eaten since you last came over. Sometimes I wouldn't come over for days. I mostly went over there tho cause I thought it was love and my house is very abusive and not safe. His mom finally became like a mom to me and me and her would tell each other everything and do everything together. She honestly was my best friend. I was to scared to lose everything and the bond I had with this family so I didn't do anything about it even tho I knew it was wrong for me to just let it slide. I then found out I was having his kid and he decided to break up with me. Me and him were gonna try to co parent. The thing that finally woke me out of being scared to lose them was do I really want to bring my own kid into this unhealthy living situation. I finally decided to call the cops and cps got involved. I felt like such a terrible person for calling so I gave them a heads up. The cop came a few days later and they tried cleaning up but it was still so bad that he said he had to get out and immediately called CPS. During the mix of this all he texted me saying he needed to come clean about something. He then texted me that he has been SAing his sister since she was 1. I then decided to call CPS and then there was 2 cases open on it. They were furious with me and I lost so many friends because of it. His mom wouldn't stop saying if I lose my kids it's because of you. He decided to stay in my life only because I was pregnant with his kid but after I found out I was having a miscarriage he blocked me on everything. I honestly feel like I did something wrong by almost splitting a family up. So AITAH?

(Long story)
When I was 18 I worked in a factory. I met a lot of people there, one of them being a guy (we’ll call him Don)that would become a great friend of mine. He met my brother &amp; sister and even came over to hang out and met my mom and step dad. One day he even met my grandparents. He seemed to keep in contact with them even when our communication fell off but only once every few months. I was going through a pretty bad break up and moved back home. In this time Don would start coming over more than he ever had to see me. He started pushing for me to date him because he had “always been in love with me” and wouldn’t stop. Looking back, I was in a pretty vulnerable situation where I allowed him to push me into this relationship. He pushed for us to move in together very quickly and like a moron, I did. He started treating me different pretty quickly into the time living together. We would be doing laundry, and he would say something like “I don’t think I’ll ever trust you” (i was NEVER unfaithful. I had always been all about him) or he would tell me “don’t you think you should stop hanging out with X friend? They’re a bad influence.” It progressed until he started pushing and picking fights. Anytime I would raise my voice and fight back he would get physical. He would grab my arms, push me into walls pinning me, etc. one day I was trying to just scratch his back and be nice and he bit me so hard on my chest above my breast. I instantly yelled OW and he LAUGHED. It started bleeding, and over a few days it was black, blue and purple from bruising and swollen so bad. I ended up having sex with him to avoid him getting physical again (I know, it didn’t fix anything but I was trying to distract him from hurting me) Over the next week I started packing my stuff to leave him. A few people got trailers to help me leave him with no notice and he was pissed. I moved in with a coworker that night and avoided all contact with him. 

Fast forward to earlier this year. I am 23, married and have a 1 year old child. I find out he is STILL going to my families houses. I confront all family and remind what happened (I had told them before) and say I will no longer come over with my child if he is still a guest there. All agree except my grandparents. My grandmother calls me and asks why I never call/speak to her etc. I tell her because she allows my abuser over there and that I no longer feel safe coming over and will not expose my child to that. She starts cussing me telling me I’m acting like a child and that Don is just as much family as I am. And that she’s never even like my now husband etc. I stand up for my husband and tell her she is disrespectful and that if she can’t respect me and treat me like an adult then I will no longer have contact with her. She starts cussing me again and for some reason brings up my father. Telling me I’m just like my father and that he was a coward for un-aliving himself. It was my breaking point. I lose it and tell her that I will mo longer have her in my life. That I was trying to communicate and tell her how I felt to see if she would change. She started crying saying I can’t take “her great grand daughter away from her” and I told her that my child was better off without someone like her in our lives. I blocked her in every way possible and everyone who defended her. I made it impossible for her to find photos of my family/child online and blocked everyone that would send them to her. I’ve had a few family ask me when I’m going to give her another chance, I reply “I refuse to allow someone like her in my life any longer.”

In this time Don would start coming over more than he ever had to see me. He started pushing for me to date him because he had “always been in love with me” and wouldn’t stop. Looking back, I was in a pretty vulnerable situation where I allowed him to push me into this relationship. He pushed for us to move in together very quickly and like a moron, I did. He started treating me different pretty quickly into the time living together. We would be doing laundry, and he would say something like “I don’t think I’ll ever trust you” (i was NEVER unfaithful. I had always been all about him) or he would tell me “don’t you think you should stop hanging out with X friend? They’re a bad influence.” It progressed until he started pushing and picking fights. Anytime I would raise my voice and fight back he would get physical. He would grab my arms, push me into walls pinning me, etc. one day I was trying to just scratch his back and be nice and he bit me so hard on my chest above my breast. I instantly yelled OW and he LAUGHED. It started bleeding, and over a few days it was black, blue and purple from bruising and swollen so bad. I ended up having sex with him to avoid him getting physical again (I know, it didn’t fix anything but I was trying to distract him from hurting me) Over the next week I started packing my stuff to leave him. A few people got trailers to help me leave him with no notice and he was pissed. I moved in with a coworker that night and avoided all contact with him. 

Fast forward to earlier this year. I am 23, married and have a 1 year old child. I find out he is STILL going to my families houses. I confront all family and remind what happened (I had told them before) and say I will no longer come over with my child if he is still a guest there. All agree except my grandparents. My grandmother calls me and asks why I never call/speak to her etc. I tell her because she allows my abuser over there and that I no longer feel safe coming over and will not expose my child to that. She starts cussing me telling me I’m acting like a child and that Don is just as much family as I am. And that she’s never even like my now husband etc. I stand up for my husband and tell her she is disrespectful and that if she can’t respect me and treat me like an adult then I will no longer have contact with her. She starts cussing me again and for some reason brings up my father. Telling me I’m just like my father and that he was a coward for un-aliving himself. It was my breaking point. I lose it and tell her that I will mo longer have her in my life. That I was trying to communicate and tell her how I felt to see if she would change. She started crying saying I can’t take “her great grand daughter away from her” and I told her that my child was better off without someone like her in our lives. I blocked her in every way possible and everyone who defended her. I made it impossible for her to find photos of my family/child online and blocked everyone that would send them to her. I’ve had a few family ask me when I’m going to give her another chance, I reply “I refuse to allow someone like her in my life any longer.”

I, (F 18) and my coworker (M 16) got on quite well since we both like DC a lot (specifically anything Batman. We both love the comics, older shows, and video games based in the Batman franchise) so we would talk about it a lot. This led to us spending our breaks talking about our shared interests when we both worked the same day. I thought he seemed a lot like my older brother, so I felt very comfortable talking with him.

Anyway, context aside, it turns out he had developed feelings for me over the past couple months. I, on the other hand, had just gotten out of a bad relationship (it ended with a car crash that nearly ruined both our lives and the stress was too much for a highschool relationship to withstand) and I didn’t want to move forward into another relationship.

Truth be told, I was not interested in my coworker at all either since he’s so much younger than me. It would be very creepy in my opinion, but I didn’t tell him that. Instead I told him that since I was still feeling the sting of that other relationship (which is not a lie) that it would be better if he moved on to someone else. He agreed and said it was perfectly fine with him. He didn’t seem hurt or angry so I thought we were fine.

Anyway, fast forward a little while later and he invites me to watch the new Batman movie with him (the one with Robert Pattinson) and i said yes since he specifically told me it was as friends only. 

I had to cancel since my mom (who has a lot of health problems) started to have blood pressure issues, which she needs somebody to monitor her for on occasion. I was the only one available for this. We rescheduled but then he had to cancel since work came up unexpectedly for him. Then the third time I canceled since I got very sick with flu. 

I was sick for two and a half weeks and not getting any better so I went to the doctor and he told me I had a sinus infection and a double ear infection. I almost had to go to the ER for IV antibiotics. I told him this and we didn’t reschedule this time since I didn’t know how long until I would get better.

Today was my first day back to work, and I am still feeling bad.

First thing, another coworker of mine takes me aside and asks: “what’s up with you and &lt;coworker&gt;? He’s been talking about you all week.”

I was confused so I said “nothing? As far as I know.”

She proceeded to explain to me that he’s been talking shit about me to anyone who would listen. Saying how I “waited too long” and now he’s “done wasting his time on me” and that I should “know better than to dismiss someone like that”. He says that if I was well enough to work, I should have told him and we could have rescheduled again. I told him I was still feeling bad but it doesn’t seem like he cares.

I was heartbroken. Like I said, I thought he was kind of like my brother, and I considered him to be a good friend of mine. I didn’t want to believe he was so pissed at me.

I don’t think I did anything really wrong, but his friends have been telling me that I should have been more considerate to him and his feelings. 

He’s still nice to me when he sees me; still talks about Batman with me, too. But I overhear him saying some nasty stuff that I don’t want to repeat here when he thinks I’m not around.

I haven’t apologized to him at all and I haven’t gone to re-explain the situation either. I was going to, but then I realized something: if he’s going to treat me like this at a minor inconvenience, maybe I don’t wanna be his friend after all.

Still, I don’t like how people at my workplace have been acting about it. It makes me wonder if I actually am in the wrong and should have done something else.

For a little context, I am an atheist (my mom doesn't know), and my mom is a radical Christian. She doesn't do anything, except pray, doesn't even have a job, has a victim mentality and blames the devil for all her problems. She believes god will do some miracles and get her out of her messed up life.

Growing up seeing her in this situation, I told myself I'll never live this kind of life.I always take action to make my life meaningful, and now I am the one who pays all of our bills and takes care of her including raising her because she is emotionally immature.

So, I specifically told her ""don't bring your friends, unless you want me to go while we're on bad terms."" She started throwing a tantrum and telling me how I am possessed, basically saying that if it wasn't for god, I wouldn't even be able to be where I am right now. She doesn't value the work I do and all the sacrifices I make to provide for us, she just thinks it's god doing miracles, but I digress.

So, the next day when I was supposed to leave, she woke up early in the morning and went to bring her friends home. I was home cooking with my friends because it was our time to say goodbyes when I hear my mom and her friends basically storming our house (my house) praying and throwing water everywhere to the point it reached my friends who were sitting on my couch. I was ready to pick up a fight with my mom, but my friends stopped me and told me to just ignore them. They spent like 3 hours praying, singing, and discussing the most hell-threatening bible verses, and my mom was tapping on my room's door (that's where I was with my friends) while praying.

Of course, I was enraged, but I ignored everything and left. I only sent her a message to let her know that I landed safely and didn't speak to her for a few days. Then she sent me a message asking why I am not talking to her (assuming that I was busy with school projects), but I told her that it was because I was mad at her. As always she threw a tantrum, telling me that I hate her and stuff. She started to threaten me again with the word of her god, talking about prophecies and how god is gonna get me, that I cannot get away. I don't think she is toxic, but that was some toxic behaviour.

I told her to stop sending me those messages otherwise I'd block her, at least she listened. Now, I am stuck thinking about what I should do with her because I can't even talk to her because she doesn't think beyond god and evil, to her real life doesn't exist. If anything happens, it's either god doing something or the devil. I tried to talk to her rationally and initiated critical thinking in our conversation many times, but she always doesn't say anything or circle back around god and the devil.

We have been together for 12 years. My husband suffers from social anxiety. I believe he really does however I have found he often only cares about things when it benefits him. For our entire relationship I have bent over backwards for him and because of his social anxiety I have turned down inventions to events and left events early. (I started doing things on my own now because of that). Its to the point that there's a running joke in my family that I am actually not married and my husband is made up because that's how often I do things alone. There are times I feel he uses his anxiety as an excuse because we have gone to plenty of things he wants to do with no push backs or problems. Recently I wanted to try a new restaurant that is supposed to be a famous local spot. We showed up and put our name in. But the wait was 20 minutes. He pulled me outside and refused to go back in because he didn't want to wait. I even offered for him to wait in the car and me text when our table is ready. He still said no. We left. Of course i was upset and half way home he finally said if i was going to pout to turn around and go back. He gas lights me constantly saying I'm too emotional. But when he wants to do something it's an entire different story. Just last week we went to the UFC fight in a stadium of thousands of people. We watched early prelims all the way to after main event. Did I want to be there for 7 hours straight hell no! But I went because I want to share in his passions. We recently bought a house. I have done everything myself. I took care of all the paperwork. He basically bought house unseen because ""he works and is too tired to do menial tasks"". I work full time too!!! And clean the house, do grocery shopping, make his doctor's appointments, do laundry and all the million other things adults do. My realtor and I had to chase him down just to sign documents. A few times I had to do it for him. When it came to doing the final walk through he promised he would come with me. I scheduled it so it would fall on his day off so it would work better for him. Time came and he refused stating the same things. "" it's his day off so he shouldn't have to do anything. He's trying to relax."" And ""I'm lying about it being important just because I want him to come."" I feel our entire relationship I constantly give him my all with very little in return. So when he told me he was invited out to a concert, yea I got upset. I told him I felt it is unfair that he always refuses things for me but if it is something he is remotely interested in it comes easy for him. He called me selfish and said I'M being unfair to HIM and that I'm always trying to push him to work through his anxiety issues but when he actually does I'm busting his balls now and making him feel bad. AITAH for getting upset over something that should be a minor thing or am I valid in feeling I'm once again being manipulated?

The other day I was getting tested at the hospital (I had cancer when I was little and I have to get checked yearly) and I told the doctor I’ve been struggling mentally for the last 6 months, and a little of my whole life as I found it hard to keep jobs and talk to the people in my life. I thought it was because I stopped taking my ADHD medication. After all, it was too expensive for me to take without insurance. So my doctor booked me with a psychiatrist from the government to give me less expensive medication. While I was there he told me had had to give me a stronger dose as it seemed my ADHD was worse for my age. I agreed that it seemed that I dazed off or acted differently from my friends who had ADHD and I agreed to the dose. I phoned my mom when I got home to told how much it cost and all the side effects and we kept talking for a bit. Then suddenly she mentioned something shocking. She said when I was diagnosed when I was eight the doctor, diagnosed me with something else. She told me I also had a type of social autism (no I do not know the name or anything I just found out). I was so surprised as I knew I struggled with socialization for years and I felt different from other kidscwho had ADHD, I just thought I was imagining it. As my parents always pushed me to socialize, so I thought I was good at it at one point. I asked her why she didn’t tell me and she said that she didn’t want me to live with the label and rely on it. She didn’t want me to see myself differently than others. We talked a little more and trying not to give off, I was annoyed. I already felt different my whole life. I was bullied a lot in middle school and high school, and people always seemed to dislike me because I didn’t fit in with the rest of the groups. I only ever connected with other Neurodivergent people.
I was even told by teachers, that I would never graduate high school even when I had honours. I gradually started to get angrier and angrier as more time passed thinking of all of the tools I could’ve gotten help through this condition. I always struggled with being in society, even though I was good at doing my job. I always felt awkward socializing with my coworkers or customers and I feel like inevitably that got me fired. I feel if I have seen someone when I was younger I could avoid this feeling of being separated from society, and maybe helped me with some tools to help me along the way. But what made me angry most of all is my friends or other people told me to get a diagnosis of autism, and when I told my parents, they shrugged me off, saying that a label is an easy way out. I talked to my little sister about my anger towards the situation and she told me that she kind of knew but she felt like our parents were just trying to protect me and I shouldn’t be so cross with them. I told her why I’m cross with them is because they’re always kind of blaming me for not fitting in society and won’t help me with my rent when I lose a job. After all, they want me to be independent, but they knew about my struggles before I even did and still expected me to get by without any help with this condition. She kind of agreed, but she still thought I shouldn’t be so angry. So now it’s up to you to judge. Am I the asshole?"

My fiancee is a quiet individual. He's not shy or anything, just reserved and self-sufficient. He grew up in the middle of nowhere and is not used to big groups. He's also a bit worried about the cost.

However, what I have in mind is not a costly wedding. I just plan to have it in my home church, not a costly venue. I was planning to wear my mother's wedding dress, rather than buying a whole new one. Rather than having a full-catered reception, I was gonna do the wedding between lunch and dinner, and just serve some light snacks like cheese and crackers. My mama and I plan to bake the cake ourselves. This is not gonna be a costly affair.

Fiancee wants a tiny wedding. I mean TINY. In fact, he practically wanted to elope at first, trying to convince me to do a justice-of-the-peace wedding with just our parents and my brother. I put my foot down about that, because that is REALLY not what I want. We reached a compromise at 50 guests and it took a lot of convincing, but honestly I'm still really bummed about it. 

With only 25 guests to each of us, I can barely fit my immediate family and a couple besties. As stated I have a large family. I really wanted a 100 or maybe 120 guests (ie 50-60 for each of us), but he refused to budge. I feel like that's a very normal and reasonable amount. I'm still happy to marry him with 50, after all it's his wedding day too and I want him to be happy, but it's just a really big dissappointment to me, and I have no idea how I can possibly cut down enough family and friends to only invite 25 people.

For context, Fiancee has been to my birthday parties and to one of our family reunions. He knew even before we started dating, the size of my family-and-friends circle and what sort of party I like to throw. I want to be able to celebrate our marriage with my loved ones, this is a huge milestone in our lives and we only get one wedding. But at the same time, it's his day too, and he already kinda compromised. I want him to be happy too. WIBTAH if I revisited the topic and asked for a larger guest list?

Me and this guy (26 M) both have been seeing each other for 3 months. We made it crystal clear that we would only be FWB. I go to his place or sometimes he comes to mine. 

However there is another guy who I did meet on the app. He is (28M) and been very sweet. We usually go out to eat and then head to his place. We never really spoke on where we are going just until recently. We were on the phone and he was telling me that he was only talking to me and doing stuff with me only. I felt little guilty that I did not tell him anything about the other guy but he never asked. He just then proceeded to tell me, although he never asked me to he hopes I am doing the same. I just giggled and moved on to the next topic. 

I feel in some sense if he is not my significant other, than I have no commitment to this person. So should I tell him? AITA?

EDIT: the (28M) and me were transparent about us just getting to know each other nothing really serious. If he were set ground rules, then I would have told him."

zn6dwk_5962,zn6dwk,top-comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"First time posting, but I’m lost in this situation and think I need to just get out of my own head. I’m sorry for the long post and let me just say that I love my husband. My husband (27 M) and I (27 F) have been together for 8 years, married for almost 3. Our entire relationship the burden of birth control has been on me, with him very rarely using a condom. We both wanted kids after marriage and we waited to get married until I was out of college. I was hoping to wait some time after marriage, but he really wanted to start trying right away. We talked it over and decided to just “stop not trying” after marriage. Well we got married January 2020 and pregnant March 2020. I wanted a boy and my husband has always wanted a girl, this is important later. Well I love our beautiful 2 year old son, but if I’m being truthful I had a difficult pregnancy and first year with him. It wasn’t a great time to be pregnant. Pandemic, my preexisting conditions makes any pregnancy high risk, my husband had a shoulder surgery and was out of work so I was the only income working extra hours, and my husband was not adjusting to married life or becoming a dad. At the time he was more interested in his friends, other girls, and his “hobbies” (fixing an old boat, video games, etc). I was basically left to myself to care for my own heath, the babies health, all the cleaning, cooking, and pets to myself. He did get a job and began working while finishing up his own college degree. He wanted me to stay home with the baby since he didn’t actually want to do any of the care for the baby. I agreed because I felt it was time too move onto a better job anyway and I just outgrew my job. We both thought I would go back to work down the road. After our son was born, he didn’t get better it actually got worse. I developed PPD and PPA. It was honestly the most difficult time of my life, and I was alone. I had no help and no support from either family and my husband was basically just a man child I lived with. After hitting an extreme low himself, he got some help. He landed his dream job, and I gave up everything to support him. I gave up my apartment, all my savings, even sold most of my items to finically support his transition into his dream job and his desire to own a home. It was a disaster. We couldn’t afford anything. We lost so much money and he didn’t like this job. I was constantly being harassed by the neighbor, which just made my PPA and PPD worse I think. He found a new job but it was 4 hours away from the only city either of us lived in, and I agreed. We needed a fresh start, so I gave up more. I worked whatever odd end jobs I could with a baby. I sold even more of my things. I supported his career ambitions. This was a year ago. Things have gotten much much better for us since we moved. I wasn’t really on board with another baby since I wanted to go start my career, but my husband really wanted to try for a girl. I was skeptical at first, but finally agreed that our son could use a sibling. Well I got pregnant (currently 25 weeks along) and I’m even more sick with this pregnancy. When we found out we were having another boy, my heart sank. I have a rocking relationship with my mother so it’s not that I feel like I need a daughter because I honestly not sure I would make a good girl mom. I knew my husband would just want to continue until he got a girl. Now my husband has improved with some things, but he still doesn’t help much around the house and only began to make a real effort with our son’s care after we got pregnant again. I know my husband loves our son, he really has started to play and interact with him sooo much more these past few months. I don’t know how else to say it other than I’m done. I love my son, and I’m excited to bring another baby into our family. I wanted these babies. But I’m so sick during pregnancy. I feel like I can’t be as good of a mother or caretaker to my kid while I’m pregnant and I don’t want to do this again. I have thought about this a lot, and after this pregnancy I really want to get my health under control. This is where I might be the AH. I’m overweight, and have been my whole life. But since I have been on birth control, it has been hard to loose any weight except that brief time around when I got married and I wasn’t on birth control. I don’t want to be on birth control anymore. I have two kids and preexisting health concerns. I don’t really care about looks, I want to be healthier. I want to live as long as possible to be here for my babies and stay active with my boys. I don’t want to affect my breastfeeding, and I don’t enjoy any of the side effects from other forms of birth control. I asked my husband if he would think about a vasectomy. He said he would take a week to think about it and talk to friends, and his conclusion is he won’t until he has his daughter. So I’m stuck. I don’t want anymore kids, but my husbands plan is basically to wear me down until I have another kid and hope it’s a girl. I feel this is disrespectful, he is ignoring what I am communicating I need for my body and instead just deciding that his wants are more important. I can get my tubes tied after this one is born. But it is surgery and my husband still can’t regularly take care care of our one kid. How am I suppose to get a surgery done while breastfeeding a baby and caring for a toddler by myself! I’m hurt also. My husband is making me feel like me and our sons won’t ever be enough until he has a daughter. I have given up and sacrificed so much for him and his dreams and his desires. I’m on my second pregnancy, I can’t mentally or emotionally handle another let alone the physical changes pregnancy and birth does. Truth be told I’m still traumatized how he treated me and our son during and after my first pregnancy. Maybe if I had a better experience into motherhood and was more supported I would want more kids. But that’s not how it is. I have told him if having a girl is so important, leave me for someone else who would want to have more babies. I would gladly split custody of our kids 50/50, that would give me some child free time that I could go back to work finally. He insist he doesn’t want that and he loves me. I know condoms are not going to be realistic since he never really used them before so I just don’t know what to do. As we get closer to our due date, every time I mention this issue he gets a bad attitude. He has been oddly more affectionate lately, so I’m not sure if there already is another women or if he just starting to butter me up so I will change my mind about another child. I know this isn’t going to change for me, I simple have given all I can give. If he wants a girl that badly, I think my marriage is over. I love him, I love our family, and I recognize all the effort he is making on being a better father and husband. But I’m heartbroken. WIBTAH to end our marriage?"
znj62w_5968,znj62w,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"My \[F21\] parents are very strict and traditional, but I do love and respect them. I try my best to make sure I clean up after myself, and I end up cleaning up after everyone else often, too. There’s seven of us kids, three with special needs. For years, I’ve been the “built-in babysitter.”

The problem started long ago, but it really picked up last week when my mom and I got into it. My younger sister has autism and has severe mood swings. She’s a teen, but she’s on the mentality of a 3-year-old and is non-verbal. So, temper tantrums of the same severity as a toddler, but she has the strength of an adult. Do with that information what you will.

After she had a meltdown the other day, my mom asked me to take her somewhere in my car. When I told her I didn’t feel comfortable taking her anywhere when she was currently in such a vitriolic mood, my mom blew up on me, told me I could start paying bills and only be part of the family when it “suited my fancy.” Now, again, mind you, I try to respect my parents, because I am grateful they have kept a roof over my head and food on the table. I am the cleanest person in the house, I do the dishes and laundry without being asked, and I help make sure the kiddos are in pajamas and medicated at bedtime. I also make sure that when I get home in the evenings that the house is straight, and when asked I cook dinner for the nine people under our roof. On top of that, I work a full-time job (which doesn’t make great money, but I have to get my foot in the door to get hired), and I just graduated with my teaching certificate summa cum laude and am now waiting for a teaching position to open in my area so I can move up the ladder.

Now, the kicker. My fiancé and I have had to bite our tongues several times, but we’re at an impasse with my parents, and that’s why I’m considering moving out. Final straw, anyone? When fiancé and I started dating, my parents asked us to respect the “third wheel rule.” Again, very traditional. For a while, I appreciated it. Since my fiancé and I both are on the same page about waiting for marriage, we agreed. So, we’ve always had a third wheel with us, even after we got engaged. Kind of awkward, but it was also an opportunity for us to get to know each other’s friends and family, so whatever, right?

Wrong. Yesterday, my dad expressed some concerns and let me know that he now expects a third wheel from my family with us at all times, even when I go to my fiancé’s family home. Apparently, he is uncomfortable that fiancé and I are affectionate with one another? We haven’t even kissed in front of my family, so I’m not sure what his deal is and he won’t communicate with me. I had no idea this was even a problem until he stuck me with that.

My fiancé, of course, said absolutely not, because that is very disrespectful towards his family and my dad does not have authority in their household. Which I agree with. It’s not like we’re asking to break the third wheel rule—we’re just asking that his family can fill the role. I feel like it’s a major overstep of authority on my dad’s part, but my parents say that it’s not enough of a reason to move out and if fiancé loved me, he would respect this decision. But that's not the only reason, just the straw that's breaking the camels back. I'm also putting up with the expectations of being an adult with the stipulations of being treated like a child. 

I’m not sure if moving out will destroy relationships or if not moving out will destroy relationships. I’m talking to my grandparents this week to see if the offer of a place to stay is still available for a few months but if not, my fiancé and I are eloping and getting an apartment in town until construction is done on our tiny house. We’re six months out from the wedding, so I’m not sure if anything is worth doing at this point. WIBTA if I just just said ""shove the dutiful daughter philosophy"" and move out?"

My husband and I are childhood sweethearts. We have known each other since the age of 5 and 7. (Important detail)

   My husband and I are expecting our third child. I mentioned to him that during the labor and delivery process I want it to be him and I, like it was with the birth of our second child. It was special and meant so much to me. Even when we went home it was just my hubby, our oldest, the newborn and I. We allowed the occasional approved visitors. Nothing over night. (Before Covid) He was hesitant but agreed. 
  Recently, his mother was released from prison. The first 9 years of our relationship she was not present and barely involved. Phone calls and letters only. She moved to a neighboring town from where we lived at the time. (My husband’s career ￼took off and we ended up moving 5 hours away.) 
  Since her return she has treated me and spoken to/of me poorly. She was not like this to me before Mine and hubby’s relationship, over the phone, or when we were providing her money for commissary￼. My husband has sided with me and stood his/our ground when she has overstepped. That’s not my issue. He has been my rock through that. 
    She continues to make the comments about being present for the birth, being the first to hold baby, and dates she prefers for me to be induced, for her work convenience. I don’t plan on being induced or even announcing when I labor. I have told her many times. To witch she replied with rolling her eyes. 
   Due to my dad moving states and changing jobs he lost everything and has temporarily moved in with us. (Important detail.)
    I brought it up again tonight, how I don’t want visitors and was thinking of sending out a group family message saying I don’t want family coming to stay overnight to “help” with the new baby. (To me, sitting and holding the baby while new moms do the cooking, cleaning, etc, is not at all helpful. I would just prefer do it all myself.) 
  He was kinda upset and mentioned that it wasn’t fair to his mom, that my dad would get to be here with the baby and she couldn’t. My dad works 12 hrs 6 days a week. So him coming home, eating dinner, going to bed, and leaving first thing in the morning is not what I consider that kind of visitor. 
  Then he reminded me, this would be her first, last, and only time to get to involved in one of her grandkids birth due to him being her only child. I’m trying to emphasize the situation but no matter how I try, I’m not comfortable. 

    My sister says “just do it” and if it was me and my kids I would want to be involved too. But she and my sister have a good relationship. That has only made me feel guilty… but I don’t feel like I should. It’s not my intention to exclude her/ anyone completely, just not have her/ anyone overnight, living hours away she’d end up staying with us anyway.

 Am I being overly sensitive/emotional? Or am I valid in feelings and thoughts?"

zo7lpx_6009,zo7lpx,top-comment,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"I (25m) am engaged to my fiancée (25f) with whom I've been with for almost 6 years. Our relationship is great and while we do have the normal arguments a couple would have, we quickly resolve any conflict and trust each other a lot. We are head over hills for each other.

My brother (37m) John (fake name) used to be married to his ex but they divorced 5 years ago because she cheated and got pregnant by another man. I sympathised a lot with him but ever since he's started developing a crazy incel mentality that hates anything related to women. He's dated women ever since but treats them horrible as a way to get revenge to the ""female gender"" for what his ex did to him.

Now John and I also have another brother, Jim (34m). Jim is married and he's facing some crisis with his wife recently. Not the cheating kind but there's a lot of trouble in their marriage where they're both responsible for the conflict. But John only seems to blame Jim's wife.

Yesterday it was my fiancées birthday and she didn't want to plan any party because she's been going through some mental health issues lately. She only invited two of her best friends and they did some skincare/spa at home and later when they left I had dinner with her.

John took this to heart and started saying that the reason my fiancée didn't have a party was because she's probably ashamed to be around me anymore and she's planning something sketchy and doesn't want me around people of her circle. Just a bunch of bs. I told him that I sympathised with him a lot when his ex did what he did but I can't allow him to throw stupid accusations about my fiancée because of his own experiences. He then said that ""Regardless of age, females will hurt you. They're all the same. Cut from the same cloth. But even if she doesn't hurt you now she will hurt you after you both turn 30. Be in denial if you want but no matter what they're all the same and I'm warning you"".

I told him fine then I guess once we get in our 30s we'll find out and I'll gladly be in denial until she shows her true horrible face (sarcasm ofc). He insisted that I'm blinded by love and that I think she'll treat me differently etc. After some back and forth I called him a miserable pathetic excuse of a human being for trying to project his own trauma and hurt on to me and my fiancée and blame her for stuff she might possibly do sometime in the future according to him, stuff she hasn't even done.

My entire family (including my parents and my other brother) now attack me for being unsympathetic towards John's trauma and said I should just nod my head and move on and ""you know how John is, dont take what he says into heart"". But I just can't. John can't be excused indefinitely for his words and actions  because he got a horrible experience in the past.

I said that my husband usually struggles with this request and usually ends up getting a cake from Whole Foods on the 24th. The therapist suggested to my husband that he could get me a birthday cake this year and my husband said it was too late to do that. It’s not. It was Dec 16th. More than enough time. The therapist even went as far as to suggest him some places. He said that he doesn’t know what kind of cake to get me because I’ve changed so much. Therapist very kindly suggested that he ask me. German chocolate cake is my favorite that hasn’t changed and won’t change. 

My husband shared that I didn’t eat one cake he bought one year. But we didn’t linger to long on this. The therapist was trying to get him to think of something that we can do together to celebrate. He doesn’t want to have me over at his new place and doesn’t want to come over to our house to do something to celebrate. 

Later that evening I texted him: It hurt my feelings that you still bring up that I didn't eat the cake 4 years ago. It was an accident. It makes me in uneasy because I'm not totally sure why you're mad at me about that. Are you leaving a detail about why you're mad out? 

He replied: Um, I think more sad then mad. I was super stressed out/ severely depressed/suicidal at that time and I think just proud of myself that I managed to get a cake at all. And you I think you made like a pie or something instead? I forget. And it just kinda ruined any joy I still had left for the holiday. Was a hard hit to my moral I guess. So I just haven't felt any real want or need to get you a cake. Didn't feel special,  hence just halfassing it.

My parents were there that Christmas. My mom had asked me to make a chocolate pie so I did. I did not make the chocolate pie to replace the cake. No one brought the cake out with candles and sang me happy birthday. The cake remained boxed up and unopened in the fridge the whole day. 

My dad is a narcissist alcoholic and my mom is a traumatized enabler. It was a very stressful day. That was the last time they were both allowed in my home together for the holidays.

Here’s what I am wanting to know. Am I the asshole for not eating the cake? It was honestly an accident. I feel like there is something he is expecting of me that I’m not understanding and he’s struggling to communicate."

My birthday is on Christmas. All I want for my birthday is a fancy birthday cake, candles, and a verse of happy birthday.  
My husband and I are separated and in couples counseling.

My(17f) mom (51) is not a regular person. She can be the nicest parent in the world, buying me things, talking to me etc, but she can also be very mean and abusive. She never hit me but she did hit my sister (and she kicked her out too but that’s a story for another day). Ever since I was a child she screamed at me alot and made me cry and I remember being scared of her so much I would hide a knife under my pillow incase she’ll try to hurt me. I think she went to therapy sessions and she calmed down over the years. She did had a meltdown once in a while but it wasn’t as bad. Now, 6 months ago she had a HUGE meltdown. She was angry because we couldn’t move into the apartment we wanted to live in (long story, doesn’t really matter). I wasn’t with her at the moment she had the meltdown but I tried to calm her down by texting her and telling her that everything’s gonna be okay. She then started to record messages and screamed at me and told me basically how much she hates me. When I got to our house it was really messy. The chair was laying on the floor, the floor was dirty and had stains of coffee on it and inside the sink were broken glasses. I knew that it wasn’t gonna end well so I called my dad and asked him to pick me up. Meanwhile I packed my clothes, my albums, everything I care about and cried. I sent her a recorded message of me crying and admitting to her that she broke my heart because of her actions. She then sent me a bunch of recorded messages saying  how bad of a daughter I am, and that she’s driving right now and nobody’s gonna find her. Her boyfriend also texted me and asked me to call her since she isn’t answering his calls. I didn’t call her. After that the police called me since her bf reported my mom missing and they wanted to find her, I told them everything and kept on packing my stuff. My dad came and when I got to his home my mom sent me a message saying to take my stuff from our home, put the key under the carpet and to never come back because I’m unwelcomed. As I said, she had meltdowns in the past but she never kicked me out. I decided to never come back to that house. After a few days she began to act like nothing happened, she sent me nice messages like “goodmorning sweetheart” and stuff like that. I did answer but I just wrote “good morning” or “thank you” without showing alot of affection. After a few weeks I decided I’ll meet her with the present of my psychologist. When she saw me she cried and I cried too. We talked and she said that she understands now that she shouldn’t take her anger on me and that she goes to a psychologist once in 2 weeks. After that meeting I felt like I can talk to her normally again (although I won’t live with her again). She even would send me presents from time to time and I always said thanks and that I appreciate it. but then she crossed a boundary I set (again, long story, if u want I can explain in detail) and I decided to block her. After that she posted a paragraph about me and about how great of a mother she is and how the 2 daughters she has left her alone on Facebook. I decided I won’t talk to her ever again. She won’t get to meet my kid, she won’t get to see me graduate or join the army. She’ll be nothing for me. My grandparents from her side of the family are trying to convince me that it’s a bad choice, but I disagree. AITA for cutting contact with her for the rest of my life?"

Steve and I are black. So is Steve's sister, Stella. Steve and I are mid 30s. Stella is early/mid 20s. These points are relevant. 

Stella works in the Healthcare field. She is doing quite nicely for herself. Her issue is with finding that special someone. 

Stella and I were talking about her (""sad, if not non-existent"", her words) dating life. I asked her to elaborate. 
The themes of her dates:

1. Not wanting marriage, but wanting kids, aka wifey 

2. Wanting a ""traditional, old-fashioned gender roles"" wife; but still wanting a 50/50 split of expenses 

3. Wanting 1 and 2; but it wouldn't be 50/50 as they earn less than her 

4. Attempting to get her to be in a situationship, as they ""aren't in the headspace"" to be serious; but want sex

5. Bragging about having no kids, no criminal record, having a car and a job

Stella is upfront about her relationship goals; dating for marriage; and being a SAHM after reaching certain goals with savings/buying a house. The men seem to try to talk her out of her standards. Two dates accused her of wanting to live like a white woman

Stella said that she can't get a ""good, black man"". I asked her why did he need to be black. Her response? ""I want my baby to look like me; and keep the race going"". I told her that the race is doing just fine, too fine even, with ""keeping the race going"". I also said that, even with a black man, the baby might not look like her, aside from skin color. I went on to tell her that we are the least married race, and, that, if she wants marriage, she'd do better expanding her dating pool to others who may be more marriage minded. Finally, I told Stella that, due to black women outnumbering black men by more than one million, even if every black man wanted to get married tomorrow, she still stood a good chance of not getting one. So why keep fishing in a pond when there's an ocean?

Steve heard that. He morphed into a Hotep and said that we can't compare the black family dynamic to other races. How black women are strong; so we're not supposed to be soft and brought up female African warriors. Then, he brought up slavery and sexual fetishism of black women by non black men, so a nonblack man would never/rarely have pure love for her. Finally, he brought up how each of our mothers struggled with two jobs, had a man who didn't make anywhere near as much as them, but STILL gave that man ""the respect he was due as man of the house"" ""he didn't need the government to be her husband"", and how ""our moms and grandmas struggled, but didn't complain"".

I thanked Steve for proving my points for me. I told Stella that expanding your options is not excluding any race. It's just a way to increase her chances of finding the best man for her

Steve called me an asshole for ""furthering the gender war  between black men and women"". He said I wanted Stella to be a ""ghetto gagger"""

zp4k14_6050,zp4k14,top-comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I (40F) recently moved across the country for a job my two daughters decided to move in with their dad (45M). For a little backstory my daughters have been in private school there whole lives so Their dad and I have decided to each pay for one of their tuitions. My older daughter(15) has had her tuition paid by her dad and I pay my younger daughter’s(13) tuition. Let’s call them Delilah(younger) and MacKenzie(older). Delilah has been look forward to going to the school MacKenzie goes  to, but due to the fact I just moved I didn’t have enough money to afford it so I told her that she’ll have to stay at her current school which is about half the tuition. Though MacKenzie decided to switch to public so that means their dad wouldn’t have to pay for MacKenzie’s tuition so Delilah asked if her dad could pay half and he said yes. Though I declined the offer because if he’s willing to pay half the tuition why can’t he pay the full thing. I have been living with my daughters for virtually their whole lives without any help from their dad except for help for their medical bills. Delilah is calling me petty because my decision to not split the tuition because the reason I could give was didn’t help me, but I personally don’t think I have to give a reason. I don’t see why she can’t stay at her current school she has said she hates it but it’s one more year and I’d rather pay for her tuition when I don’t need help from her dad. She’s now calling me selfish and petty because my decision affects no one but her because whether she goes to the school or not doesn’t affect me or her dad. But when I told her how hard it was to move and how their dad would split her tuition with me then so I don’t to split it now she said it was your decision to move and dad was still paying MacKenzie’s tuition at the time so why should he pay mine. I think my daughter is being spoiled and selfish but she says it’s unfair because MacKenzie was able to go. So aita.
For some more backstory I have another child that I was also taking care of at the time though she went to public school (through her own choice) and he did not pay most of her bills . I grew up very poor house and I don’t want my daughter to think that private school is a given which is what I think she thinks. As for not treating my daughter equally, I treat them very equally but I don’t think sending them to different schools due to financial reasons is favoring one over the other."

My sister, lets call her Roxy (24 f) had a large freak out last night and ended up hurting me and my siblings with what she said. For context, She has a cat and whenever she's not home we all help take care of it. Last night, she had left some few hours before its feeding time and because my other sister, Tina (23) was very very sick, I (17) was the one who had to take care o the cat and my sick sister. The only other person in the house was my little cousin who's 12 and he was out playing with his friends.

Everything was fine, I helped feed the cat and followed every other instruction she had left such as not letting it go out in the evening or not letting another neighborhood cat from coming in to the house, which I did without a problem, all the while also studying and other chores and making sure Tina wasn't getting any worse. My parents soon returned with my aunt and my mom sent me and my aunt to get some medicine at the pharmacy in light of Tina's illness. By this time it was 9PM and Roxy hadn't returned yet. When we returned it was pretty chaotic in the house as we had to prepare dinner, keep an eye on Tina and the two cats at the same time (One wanted to go out and the other stray wanted to come in). I tried my best to juggle all of these tasks at once but Roxy came back and took over dinner duty. I was pretty tired after the long day and finally decided to sit down but, my dad opened the door and the damn cat got out.

Roxy begins to freak out and starts shouting at me, my 12 y/o cousin and my sick sister. She said some pretty hurtful stuff, practically calling me useless and at one point, as I was in my room keeping something that's behind the door, she opened the door and once she saw me, shoved the door at me which ended up hurting me as the door handle hit my abdomen. She continues her rant and insults and goes out to look for the cat. About a half hour later she comes back with her cat and acts as though nothing had happened.

However what she said definitely hurt me to a whole new level. She said that I can't even help her with anything, going on about how selfish we are. I feel extremely unappreciated and as though everything I try my best to help her out of my good will go unnoticed. I decided to just return her phone as she lent it to me to use for a while and left her a note telling her how I felt about what she said. I've not talked to her since and will not talk to her until she apologizes not just to me, but to everyone. I don't think she will though. It's also not the first time. Just last month she had a fall out with my mom for whatever reason, and she was pretty cold to Tina for a better part for a year, even saying she hates her. So, am I the Asshole?"

I requested a cake with a happy birthday there and because of his nagging he didn't even notice.  We got to the nar afterwards, I was asking the nanny if I could pick my daughter up and she took my daughter to a christmas party with her family obviously we were upset. He started yelling at me again and saying how I preferred my friend who baby sat my daughter over him. Then my best friend came over to celebrate his birthday he kept kissing her hand and everything when I asked him if he could stop kissing her hand, he got upset and started yelling at me again, it got to the point where we got kicked out of the bar for his yelling and him pulling my hair. In the car I was with my daughter in my arms he kept trying to kiss me I said no we were over he forced me a bit my lip. My lip is swollen for the bite. 
I told him we were over and to not touch me. He kept trying to kiss me, I kept saying no, until I pushed him myself from the neck. Anyways he says IATAH for breaking up with him on his birthday.

In the original post I guess a couple of people were right about not being able to meet his family being a red flag.


Update: thank you everyone for the comments, I feel now less guilty, and I am standing by with my decision. He has been trying to reach out but I have blocked him out of everything."

Even though I didn't want to I agreed, I ended up having mine about a month later and he still has not had his. I started to get uncomfortable and asked him if he would consider not hooking up with someone because seeing him talk to these other girls made me sad, to which he responded ""it's only fair since you got to so I'm doing rather you want me to or not"". Over the last few days, I've noticed him texting a girl and smiling, I'm aware it's wrong but I went through his phone to see their texts which consisted of them telling each other how much they like one another, calling each other pet names, sending kissy faces and heart emojis, and talking shit about me. He also told her that he wanted to be friends with benefits even though our agreement said it would be one-and-done. They also had an actual date planned to go see Christmas lights, the one date I've asked him to take me on since we started talking in January. He has also been caught going through my phone multiple times since the begging of our relationship and I've never been rude to him about it, but once he found out what I did he got upset. When I brought it up to him he was very dismissive, and didn't apologize or really say anything other than he didn't want to break up and that I have trust issues for going through his texts. I am aware of my role in what happened but what he's doing feels like emotional cheating and it really hurts. Would I be the asshole if a broke up with him over it?"

I've been in love with her the moment we shared our first kiss. 
Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 4 months, after almost half an year of persuasion she agreed to go out with me and we've been going out since.

 So last week in 4 months we did it for the first time, but I was not able to get that much into it because she hadn't shaved down there. I didn't know how to tell her that so I just went with it. Afterwards she asked me how was it I said it was awesome trying to sound as believable as possible but she caught me so I told her that i don't like hairy private area and am not able to get into it, it'll be better if she waxed it next time. She got a bit offended by it and told me that waxing hurts as it is let alone down there she has tried it couldn't take the pain and shaving is useless as it grows back the next day and itches, not comfortable she trims it to length she's comfortable with. 

I tried to tell her that I'm uncomfortable with it and she should do something about it on which she got angry and said I was humiliating her and I should try waxing myself before saying it and if I continue this i won't be getting any. I've changed things about myself that she didn't like, like my haircut and smoking habits (it's really hard to quit but i did it for her) shouldn't she do the same 

I think she overreacted or am I the asshole

Edit : if it wasn't clear I was talking about giving her oral not penetration when I said wasn't able to get that much into it.

A lot of you guys are telling I kinda forced her boundaries so she agreed to go out with me but first of all if she didn't like me she would have said so, she told me she's not interested in a relationship (not me) until she graduates but after would consider one so I waited and after her graduation she made the move of asking me out and she said it herself that she liked the fact that I waited for her and thought it was romantic."

zq8pcn_6121,zq8pcn,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"UPDATED…….TW SA Some context, I (32F) was r*ped when I was 17 during a home invasion(I was home alone). It has taken me years of intensive therapy to learn to live with what happened to me and I am now in a great place, and overall happy. I should mention as part of my healing process I’ve taken Muay Thai( Thai kicking-boxing) since I was 18 to help develop a sense of control and self defense. One of my few triggers due to the nature of how my attack went down is being grabbed from behind. Being grabbed from behind automatically makes me panic and triggers my PTSD. All my close friends and family are aware of this, they don’t all know the reason behind the fear, they just know not to do it including my BIL. Now onto the AITA part. Last week I hosted a get together with a couple of family and friends at my home. My BIL(29M) has always been some thing of a prankster/jokester. In the 5 years that he and my sister have been together, we have gotten along fairly well, and his prankster ways has never been an issue as he’s never really directed them towards me. At one point during the evening I went upstairs to change. My BIL thought it would be “hilarious” to scare me as a prank. While heading back downstairs in the hallway, he came out of the guest bedroom and grabbed me from behind. I lost my shit. In my panic i elbowed him in the face which ended up breaking his nose. Even after everyone rushed upstairs, and I saw it was just him I could not stop spiraling and was in a full meltdown. I ended up calling him every name in the book and kicking him out of my home. Now that a few days have passed, my sister reached out stating that she thinks I need to apologize. Her reasoning being that he had no way of knowing that pulling a “harmless prank” would have caused such a reaction, especially since he didn’t know the reason behind my fear. I stand by that, it doesn’t matter that he didn’t know the details of why I was scared. He was aware that it was a debilitating fear caused by something traumatic and should’ve known better. Not to mention that he has yet to apologize to me as I “broke his nose”. Our family believes that my violent reaction was justified, however they do think that kicking him out was a step too far. So AITA?

*UPDATE: first and foremost, I would like to thank everyone for all the support and wonderful comments. Especially all the comments calling me a bad ass for learning to defend myself and get to the point where I am today. Truly thank you, you all put a genuine smile on my face. Also, all the F around and find out comments made me laugh, which, after all the recent events was definitely needed. I wanted to first clarify/answer some common questions I saw. For those wondering what I meant by being grabbed from behind it is not a simple tap on the shoulder or a gesture someone would make when simply trying to get your attention, when I say grab from behind think bearhug. Also for those wondering my attacker was caught and is currently still behind bars. I ended up sending my family, sister and  BIL included the link to this post. After reading the comments, you all have made the family members that were previously thinking that I took it too far in kicking him out apologize and agree that until I felt comfortable, my BIL is not to be invited anywhere I am. Especially since he I am told is doubling down on that while “maybe it was messed up of him to scare me, it was still just a prank and I still broke his nose and need to apologize”. So with that being said, I decided that he could kick rocks and I hope his nose heals crooked. My sister and I have not spoken. She sent me a text asking to meet me this weekend to talk. Throughout this ordeal the thing that has hurt the most has absolutely been the way she has downplayed what her husband did. She more than anyone knows how hard everything was for me, and was there to see the aftermath of my attack. Depending how everything goes this weekend I will take the advice you all have made and make the decision on whether I need to go low/no contact with her. At least, until she fully understands the severity of the situation and apologizes. I will possibly update this post one last time after this weekend to let you all know where we stand. Again thank you all

*2nd UPDATE: hello all, after a very difficult and tearful conversation with my sister, I have come to the decision to go low/no contact with her. Completely no contact for sometime. She like the rest of my family after reading all the comments you all have made finally saw it from my perspective. She did apologize and state that she truly does understand what her husband did was wrong, however, she feels for the sake of her own marriage that she needs to stick behind her husband. And so in the meantime, if her husband is not welcomed somewhere, she will not be there either. I will say I am very hurt and disappointed, but that was her decision to make just like I made my decision in keeping my distance as it’s become clear that it will not be possible to maintain a relationship with her without maintaining one with him, which is not something I am willing to do for the foreseeable future. Almost 3 weeks after the event and after reading hundreds of comments, this man is still doubling down. Even apparently had the nerve to say that the reason why everyone is on my side is because I provided a “sob story” beforehand. He still apparently fully believes that despite it being “messed up” it was still just a “joke” and I “overreacted and I am lucky that he doesn’t decide to sue me for the medical bill that he is going to receive for the broken nose.” Not that it will go anywhere as him grabbing me is considered assault. I will no longer be updating this post. Again, thank you all for the support and I hope you all have a wonderful holiday ❤️"

During the beginning of our relationship we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in their apartment. About a year and a half later we now live right in my parents backyard, which is a lot better, but now we have another problem. I have one sister, (16 F) she is from my step-dad's previous marriage, and up to now we had a great sibling relationship, we only started not getting along shortly after I found out that the guy I was with in high school had been communicating with her behind my back, not just normal conversations either. Mind you the guy was 18 at the time, I was 16, and she was 11 or 12. There was also a situation where she was 14 and dating a 22 year old behind our parents backs, and needless to say I was the one she decided to blame when she got caught trying to meet up with said 22 year old after he stated that he was going to bring all these drugs and alcohol to her so that they could get high and drunk. Back to the main topic, apparently her affinity for older men is still going strong. About a month into living on my parents' property I realized what I would be dealing with was a lot more than I originally thought. At first she stayed to herself as most teens do, but in the past few months, since we found out I'm pregnant, I've noticed that if he is somewhere, she usually goes right to where he is, if we are standing around talking, she stands closer to him than I do. I expressed that I had a problem with it and asked that she not invade his personal space so much because at that point multiple people in my family and my friends that come over had pointed out that it looks like she has a crush on him and that I may want to nip this situation in the bud before it becomes a problem. During my talk with her, she claimed she hadn't realized she was doing it, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but I noticed she was making comments such as ""I'm into older men..."" so it stayed in the back of my head. A month goes by and she had gotten much worse about it, she followed him like a lost puppy, and if there was a gathering of any kind, she would acknowledge him first, and only talk to him until someone else talked to her to start a conversation. Yet again I had another talk with her, again all she wanted to talk about in response was that she didn't realize she was doing it, then turn the subject to how bad her mother treated her, and how she likes older men. Shortly after the second talk, my best friend came over for thanksgiving. I had to attend multiple thanksgivings so my fiancé and I ended up leaving, my best friend chose to stay so that they could spend time with my brother and grandmother, whom they have considered family for years. Come to find out, my step-sister had pulled my best friend to the side and told them that I was being a total bitch and that I was telling everyone that she was ""flirting with my boyfriend"". basically telling my best friend how much of a horrible sister I was. Later on my best friend told me everything she said. I confronted her on the matter, asking why she felt like she could just talk to my friend about me like that. At first she pretended not to know who I was talking about, mind you I only have one friend that comes over consistently enough to even be involved in a holiday at my family's house. After confirming what I meant and who I was talking about, all she had to say to me was that I ""know how \[she\] feels"" about this whole subject. After 4 months of this, obviously I'm tired of the bullshit and asking nicely because she doesn't care. I told her that it was obvious she didn't respect or care for me, so from now on, if she had a long day or she needed somebody, she would not be able to count on me, as I do not help people that continue to disrespect me, and had no regards for my relationship or the boundaries that come with said relationship.

If you would have asked me I would have swore to the moon nd back that he would never go behind my back and talk to other women. This year we decided to spice up our relationship and have a threesome, he automatically knew exactly who he wanted to join (which should of been my first red flag). It was a coworker of his who ""randomly"" texted him and they became ""friends"". He spoke with the girl and told me she was completely down with trying a threesome as well. Skip to the day of the threesome we decided to get a hotel and he told me he would meet me there so I did, when I got there she was already in the room and he told me he didn't fully tell her that I was going to be involved. Which instantly upset me, he said he told her I wanted to watch. During this I didn't just watch but joined in but he seemed to give her all of the attention which made me feel very insecure and upset because it seemed like I was the one invited instead of the other way around. After there was an argument because some of the rules we set he broke. I told him I didnt want to talk to her anymore and he told me that he did and found out that he continued talking to her. When he was caught he told me that it was because he wanted another one and didn't want to just stop talking to her. So then again  asked to look at his phone and seen that the text they had started way before i knew and went into eat more detail then I knew, I also seen that there were many pictures sent from her to him. I told him to delete her again this time i just had a gut feeling so i went to look at his phone (we have eachothers passwords) and his password was changed, he made an excuse saying he did that so the kids couldn't get into his phone. Finally i threatened to leave if he didnt deleted her for good. It was good for a few months but I still seen that he was messaging other females not sexually but flirty asking y they weren't at work and if they were ok do to a post they made whatever. Skip ahead a couple months and I found out that he was talking to another girl at his work and met up with her at a work party and helped her move. Mind up he told he helped a guy at work move and that the party was boring. Again I gave him another chance. then I just found out that he is still talking to the threesome girl on snapchat and had her under a different name and also a few other girls that I didnt know about. I have given him way to many chances.  I cant believe he would throw 20 +yrs away for some young dumb girls. So I am secretly talking with a lawyer and getting ready to serve him with papers that he has no idea is coming. Now he can get shocked by something I do, AITA"

After there was an argument because some of the rules we set he broke. I told him I didnt want to talk to her anymore and he told me that he did and found out that he continued talking to her. When he was caught he told me that it was because he wanted another one and didn't want to just stop talking to her. So then again  asked to look at his phone and seen that the text they had started way before i knew and went into eat more detail then I knew, I also seen that there were many pictures sent from her to him. I told him to delete her again this time i just had a gut feeling so i went to look at his phone (we have eachothers passwords) and his password was changed, he made an excuse saying he did that so the kids couldn't get into his phone. Finally i threatened to leave if he didnt deleted her for good. It was good for a few months but I still seen that he was messaging other females not sexually but flirty asking y they weren't at work and if they were ok do to a post they made whatever. Skip ahead a couple months and I found out that he was talking to another girl at his work and met up with her at a work party and helped her move. Mind up he told he helped a guy at work move and that the party was boring. Again I gave him another chance. then I just found out that he is still talking to the threesome girl on snapchat and had her under a different name and also a few other girls that I didnt know about. I have given him way to many chances.  I cant believe he would throw 20 +yrs away for some young dumb girls. So I am secretly talking with a lawyer and getting ready to serve him with papers that he has no idea is coming. Now he can get shocked by something I do, AITA"

Here is a little bit of context behind said situation, I had gotten pregnant with my daughter at 16 and. my boyfriend was 17 at the time. His grandmother would constantly say to me that I am hurting my daughter by not gaining enough weight, and that she would be hooked up to machines because of my issue with gaining weight in the start of my pregnancy but overall I did gain a lot of weight throughout. A bit of context I am 5'9 and have always been on the smaller side, I did end up gaining 61 pounds over the span of my pregnancy with her. My boyfriends grandmother would always say things to me like she was going to beat me up and belittle and talk down to me as if I was a stray dog. When my boyfriend and I had gotten our own apartment when I was 6-7 months pregnant she would show up unannounced and just walk in the door of our home. if the door was locked she would bang on the door like she was the police. I could be butt a\*\* naked or in little to no clothing at all and she would just walk in and not give us a heads up. She has acted like she has had control over us and how we raise our daughter since the time she found out we where expecting.

A bit of context on his mother, I had initially moved in with him when we found out I was pregnant, as I did not feel comfortable living with my parents because we do not have the best relationship. We lived with his mom and dad. The whole time we have lived there his mom would say how she was going to hit and and beat me up. At one point I had fallen down their stairs I was crying because I was pregnant and was sacred for the safety of my child and she laughed at me and said ""grown men have hit me harder then that"". She was on drugs and would constantly talk to herself and scream and yell at people in the house for no reason at all. I would lock myself in the bedroom and just do my own thing until my boyfriend would get home from work because I was not comfortable to be out of the room on my own.

The situation at hand, Two days ago his grandmother and mother just tried to walk into our new home which we rent from his uncle (40 m). the door was locked so she banged on the door like the cops trying to break in. I was not dressed I had a shirt and underwear on and no bra on, as I am actively beat feeding, I am a stay at home mom so I don't feel the need to get dressed to the tens when its just me and my daughter and my boyfriend home. My boyfriend and daughter where also asleep taking a nap together. I picked up my daughter and walked away and woke up my boyfriend to answer the door as I felt uncomfortable answering the door not dressed and with my daughter sleeping. He answered the door and it was his grandmother and mother at the front door. His grandmother just kept saying over and over again we are here to see my granddaughter bring her out here now bring her to me now I want to see her. We are here to see her and there is nothing you can do about it. My boyfriend told her that she can not keep just showing up to the house that she needs to call or message one of us to come over to the house, and she said whatever got all mad and just stormed out of the house and took my daughters Christmas presents back that she had gotten for her. I guess she had called his uncle who we rent from (her son) and he showed up to our house to yell at my boyfriend saying "" she has done everything for everyone in this family you need to let her see the baby, she has a right to see her granddaughter."" He also kept screaming and saying ""is she the reason why"" ""is she the problem"" talking about me. My boyfriend really was baffled he was saying any of this and just said she can not keep just showing up to the house constantly unannounced and walking in the door or pounding on the door like show owns the house.

Later that night my boyfriend and I sat down and talked he says that I have a right too feel this way and he feels the same way. But apparently everyone in his family thinks that we are in the wrong for feeling this way. Are we the a\*\* holes or are we in the right for how we feel?

zrebtn_6154,zrebtn,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"Good morning. 

Just wanted to write in here to see if I’m really an absolute ah or not.  

I don’t feel like I’ve done anything wrong…but my neighbours thinks i did. 

On my daughter’s last day of school they called me to come and pick her up as she was not feeling ok. I live 10 minutes drive away from school and it will take me about 30-35 minutes to walk. ( that is not an option as we live in the country side and there are no side walks and to make my sick child walk 30 minutes in the freezing snow is not an option)

When i was about to leave I realised there was an ambulance blocking the road. We live in a cul-de-sac. Ambulance parked parallel to a parked vehicle. It snowed quite bad and te road was really bad. 

I waited for about 20 minutes for someone to show up. I ended up knocking at every door to see if they would be willing to move their car or the ambulance 1 meter forwards so i can pass. One of my neighbours was there too trying to go and pick up her kids from school. 

The neighbour that called the ambulance saw us there all worried but never said a word. She ended up opening the door for the delivery driver to collect her parcel. 

After 10 minutes the ambulance driver showed up and i asked him nicely if he could move forward 1 meter so we can pass. They said in a really rude tone, no, I need to wait for my patient.  To this point i was fuming. The neighbour that called the ambulance walked out and walked to the ambulance, hopped up on the ambulance and they stayed there for another 10-15 minutes until they left. 

This part i might be an ah as i beep the ambulance i think 2-3 times. 

I understand when it could be an emergency, but she walked outside to pick up her damn parcels…  

The ambulance had plenty of space to park in her driveway without blocking anyone. 

I apologised for my behaviour and tried to explain why i was so worried and they said my child not feeling well at school is not an emergency and they have teachers that can take care of them. 

Am I the ah?"

zrtysm_6162,zrtysm,top-comment,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"My cousin moved across the country. She got a dog and since it's the holidays I was sending gifts and thought I'd send her a local arrangement of dog treats set up like a charcuterie board. The entire packaging is covered with dog images. The ingredients specifically say ""cheesy slices for dogs"" and ""salami slices for dogs"". The packaging said ""barkuterie holiday arrangement for dogs"" (ETA, it's all dog friendly soft treats, not real cheese slices and stuff, it's made by a local vet and I do trust the source just to be clear)

I sent her packages a few weeks ago and didn't hear much back after they arrived until she called me to tell me the charcuterie I sent was awful. She said it tasted kind of off and asked where I got it. I know some dogs have sensitivities and preferences so I mentioned that if he dog didn't like it or didn't process it well I can send something else.

That's when she lost it. She was so upset at me for not specifying it was for dogs. She ate most of it and said she felt like crap after. Now it's not the worst thing to do but it's not people food but she panicked and wanted to go to a doctor or call poison control. I couldn't stop laughing because I thought she was joking at first and admittedly that's not very sensitive when she's genuinely worried but I just thought it was a big joke. When I realized she was serious I did apologize for laughing!! But she was set on me being a total asshole for not calling to explain what I was sending. 

If she just took a minute to look at the package instead of just ripping it open and eating it, it would have been very obvious what it was intended for. I don't think I'm an asshole for assuming she would have checked that."
zrvkxq_6168,zrvkxq,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"WIBTAH for firing my nanny during a mental health crisis? 

Ok, so this story is kind of a lot. I hired my current nanny after a 4 month long search. She stays at my home with my kids and dogs while I work (full time for me is 3-4 days a week) and my husband is usually working out of town. When I interviewed her she was bubbly and seemed fantastic.

She started working for me just after Thanksgiving. In early December she had several changes/stressors. I will try to keep it vague to protect her, but I have to explain a bit. We live in a military town, and she is married to someone in the military. Her SO went on 'rotation' meaning they would be out of the country for 6-9 months. She is living alone with her dog and cat in a strange city with few to no friends. I have been there, I know how bad that can be. Her dog was hurt and had to spend several days in an animal hospital to recover. She called me one night a week or two ago in a panic because she had woken up with no memory of her SO leaving or dropping her dog off at the animal hospital. I advised her to go to the ER as I was worried about her. She was checked out and treated for a mild infection and then referred to behavioral health. She understandably had to take several days off to get stabilized, then came back to work this morning. 

Today while at work I received a call from a local police officer telling me that everything was fine, everyone was safe, and no one was in trouble, but that I needed to get home ASAP because my nanny needed to leave, and an officer would be staying with my children until I arrived. By the time I got home the police had actually left, the nanny was still there, but was VERY upset. She said she had called the red cross to get a message to her SO and the chain of command that she needed SO to come home to help her until she got her mental health stabilized. Several people have been advising her to make this call, but she says she made it against her better judgement as she didn't want to interfere with her SO's job. Apparently when she explained the situation to the red cross they then dispatched officers to my home (her work address) for a welfare check. This was not something she expected and greatly upset her. After we talked for a bit and I made sure she would be safe she left to go speak to her therapist, and just let me know that she was being admitted to inpatient for a day or two.

Now comes the part where I can't decide if I would be the AH or worse. She has been working for me for less than a month. In that month she has not been able to work a total of 8 days, or two full work weeks. Besides the fact that I have more than used up my available PTO, my boss is losing patience. I absolutely want her to get the help she needs and get to a happy, healthy place, but I also need to work. She is terrified that I am going to fire her and keeps saying how much she wants and needs this job. I am pleased with the job she is doing, when she is here. I am afraid that if I fire her, it will exacerbate her problems and she will do something dire. I also need dependable care for my children while I work and am considering telling her that I am going to hire someone else while she sorts out her mental health, and we can revisit her working for me once she is stabilized. I just feel like I'm going to do the wrong thing no matter what I do."

I (19m) broke up with my ex (18f) not that long ago because I had found out she was being really shitty to a friend of mine (16f). It resulted in an argument and we broke up. It was a mess.

But afterwards I sort of just hung out with my friend more and after a while I felt like I started liking her a little more than just a friend, but I wasn’t really sure so I offered to take her to an upcoming school dance so I could test the waters a little. She was a little against it at first, but eventually told me she was joking and she’d love to go, though we had the issue of her mother to get past.

Her mom hates me because I made a joke once that she didn’t really like, but since two of her friends were there when I picked her up, her mom stayed quiet and didn’t object much aside from glaring, so it all seemed fine.

We danced a bunch, even made out in the music room, before she wanted to start dancing again so she dragged me out to dance with her. It was all going great, actually, and it as looking like I was going to score, which is always a plus.

Except my ex was at the dance. She started yelling and raving about how much of an asshole I am, was calling me a perv, etc etc, getting all annoyed in front of everyone because I took the girl we broke up over to the dance and not her.

When I was younger, he was physically abusive to both me and my older half siblings, as well as my mom. He had very little control over this, as it was due to underlying health issues and when those issues were under control he completely changed.

My mom and him divorced when I was 4. When I was younger, I avoided him because of how he treated me. As I got older, I wanted to develop a relationship with him but he started dating this woman, I'll call her B.

B has never liked me. B does not like how she doesn't hold any parental authority over me. My dad doesn't authorize B to punish me, but she's done it anyway. B has made my life a living hell. She tried to push religion onto me, and would hit me if I didn't go to church on Sundays. B was also abusive towards my father while he recovered from his physical ailments, and has quite literally berated and beaten my father into silence regarding what she does to me. B has torn up my plane tickets to go back home to see my mom. B has burnt family pictures of my father and I with my mom. B seems to think she has to compete with me for my father's attention.

Recently, my father had a revelation and realized that he couldn't take her abuse anymore. He came to me crying asking me if I could forgive him, and if I was ever happy. I told him no, explained why, explained that she made me never want to visit him again. I told him about all the horrible things she'd done to me, and he told me that he was planning on leaving her. He told me that he had cheated on her multiple times because of her abuse. He planned to sell their house and move up to my state to be near me during his final years. He wanted to help me through college and have a relationship with me. Part of his plan to leave was to make her think she was cooperating so he could pull the rug out from under, which means marriage counseling. This was about a month ago.

A week ago, I got a text from B. She told me they'd gotten back together and that they're happy. I'm understandably confused, but mostly angry. As we continue talking, I come to find out my dad shared that conversation with her, but cleverly omitted the portion of it where he told me he cheated on her. This definitely ruined my trust. But I sat and listened. Then, I get a text from my dad on the same day. He has two brain tumors.

I've always known my father would die before he reached 70. I will not spend what could easily be his final days with him if she is around. I can't do it anymore, I truly can't.

I have not talked to him about it yet. There is a large possibility that this is just B blowing everything way out of proportion, but the weirder part is the fact that he mentioned that conversation we had. I will hear him out, but if it ends up being true, WIBTAH if I cut him off?

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with my dad, and he is still planning to leave her. He had a lapse in judgement because he's scared of dying, but the tumors are not malignant and are able to be treated with medication. He says this has been a wake up call for him, and that he realized that he would rather do anything but die miserable.

UPDATE 2: I am planning on taking medical custody of him and helping him move up to my state. Thank you all for your advice. I don't want him to suffer anymore, and I think that he deserves to live out his final years with his son by his side. I'll update this post (hopefully) when we see each other in person again. "
zs0k6a_6195,zs0k6a,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"So I (22M) am my father's (60) only child. We've always had a strained relationship. When I was younger, he was physically abusive to both me and my older half siblings, as well as my mom. He had very little control over this, as it was due to underlying health issues and when those issues were under control he completely changed.

My mom and him divorced when I was 4. When I was younger, I avoided him because of how he treated me. As I got older, I wanted to develop a relationship with him but he started dating this woman, I'll call her B.

B has never liked me. B does not like how she doesn't hold any parental authority over me. My dad doesn't authorize B to punish me, but she's done it anyway. B has made my life a living hell. She tried to push religion onto me, and would hit me if I didn't go to church on Sundays. B was also abusive towards my father while he recovered from his physical ailments, and has quite literally berated and beaten my father into silence regarding what she does to me.

Last friday I was hanging out with some college classmates and everything seemed normal while we were chatting, until one of them moved their leg. That's when I noticed they had a massive dog bite on it, and we all actually got worried, it was purple and seemed greenish too. When I asked what happened, she told me that on a night out a small dog attacked her and decided to not treat the wound at all because the size of the dog meant no danger (which doesn't make sense, as far as I'm aware it doesn't matter how small or big is the animal). I tried to tell her that she needed the rabies vaccine asap, because from what she told me the dog seemed to be infected, and obviously for prevention too. (Plus, even if it isn't rabies, she can get sepsis or any other kind of infection).

But as soon as I told her that, she snapped and said that it was intrusive of me and the other girls agreed, saying that I'm an asshole for making suggestions that no one asked for. Maybe I overstepped, but I was just trying to help because she seemed in a lot of pain. So, AITA?

Edit: I know that people is going to say that It's easy from my perspective to suggest someone to go to the doctor if they are the ones paying the medical fee later. But in this case, our college has a healthcare plan included in the payment you make each semester, so she has at least that covered to get medical treatment."

I let it slide initially because the relationship was new, but over time I realized he wasn’t prioritizing the relationship even as it grew more serious. I tried to talk to him about this multiple times, only to go through a cycle of him trying for a while and then reverting back to his old ways. 

The latest instance was over the weekend. We were supposed to spend the week before Christmas together but he unfortunately popped positive for COVID. I suggested we both have a virtual movie night on one of the days, to which he agreed.

Some context: I study, hold 2 part time jobs, and volunteer. This busies up my schedule quite a lot. But I made time to have this movie night that I was looking extremely forward to. 

While we were watching the movie, my partner’s father came in to let him know that a bath had been drawn for him. I tried to ask him to wait until after the movie was over, but he maintained that he couldn’t let the water go cold and waste his parents’ efforts while they were tending to him when sick. 

He ended up taking the bath and passing out right after, effectively cutting short our movie night that I carefully planned in advance and made time for. Afterwards, we argued about it and he maintains that he couldn’t just blow off his parents like that. 

He claims he wasn’t blowing off the movie night because a reschedule can happen, but tending to his illness was pressing. I asked my friends for their opinion and some agree that he could have done the movie night and taken a hot bath after, others say that maybe I should cut him some slack in this instance because COVID isn’t the best thing to deal with.

I am a working full time mom of five adult children, (f 36), (m34), (f 32), (m 30) and (m 28). Two are adopted. I plan and work to make Christmas for all of my kids and grandkids special every year and have all but one last gift to mail. Why haven’t I mailed it? I am withholding it until my youngest starts paying me back the money he owes. I was grocery shopping the other day and said son calls to ask for money again with the promise to pay me back double when he gets paid in two days. This is not the first time money has been loaned, I bailed him out for over $2000 last year because he was in a tough spot and homeless, with the agreement he pay me back $200 monthly until the debt is paid. After a year only 15% has been paid back for various reasons, loss of job, no electricity, loss of job, car break down. At this point I probably will never see that money. I am not a well off person, but I am not poor, I pay my bills on time and budget myself so I don’t get in a bind. With only a certain amount of funds until the end of the month, this week is tight. So I loaned my son the money he needed for food but cancelled my much needed hair appointment (I haven’t had one in 6 months) and did not mail his Christmas gifts as I intended after grocery shopping. I usually don't withhold gifts for any reason because it feels petty but it just hit me crossways that I again was asked to help him out, and to make it work, I cancelled my own much needed self care.

Well I usually always get him something but he seems to hate it every year and I'm talking birthday anniversary anything you can get a gift for I have stopped because he just doesn't appreciate it nor does he put forth any good effort to get me a present either. If its for anniversary it usually benefits both of us and its a shocker if so. Sorry I'm rambling.



He loves to hunt. Usually for deer and he doesn't have a trail camera so I figured I would be nice and get him one for Christmas along with some targets for the shooting range. He did piss me off yesterday but still I wrote him a card and told him I know how he does like to open them on Christmas and I love you kind of thing. I was actually being nice and not wrapping the shit up to waste my heartache of seeing his sour face Christmas morning because believe me its heartbreaking 💔  for all of us.  I set it all up on his bedside table and put the little card in front. He comes in and out the room atleast 5 times.



Like homeboy I know you see this gift and this card. Not once stopped to acknowledge it or anything. He tends to do that alot. So I'm already pissed off and trying to get over the reason why I am pissed off (story for another time) I hear a bag drop. Never once thought to turn and look cause I thought he might have dropped something. I'm trying to go to sleep so when I get up to go to the bathroom there is a bag beside my bed. I knew it was for me no effort just in the academy bag with his online order tag still on it. I picked that fucking bag up and I didn't even have to open it to know wth it is.



Yall.....it was FUCKING RUBBER BOOTS! Like wtf would you even get these for I said it one time in passing the other day. I was so pissed. I was speechless literally. Then I asked him ""Am I really only worth a pair of rubber boots?"" Shit hit the fan.He never buys me presents for anything and the one time he does it was this. I have said all year long I wanted a stand up mixer. Hell even my kids know and have actually told him. I showed him a picture of one with a damn meat grinder attachment on it last week. My kids have even told him. The only thing he could say was I heard you say you needed some once. Are you fucking kidding me? AITHA? AM I the problem here? I guess you would just have to know him.

Jason has a set of specific yet simple chores he must do every day. He frequently does not complete them fully or doesn't do them at all. He is impulsive. He lies to get out of trouble. He gets less than great marks on his conduct reports. He breaks things. He takes things without asking. He's forgetful. He's easily distracted. 

While I know he sounds like a terror,  he's also super sweet and generous and funny and empathetic and creative... I love the kid to death. I mean, he's my son...  His behavior improves when he is on his medication, but it's not perfect. I don't expect that of a 10 year old boy. 

I tend to let small things slide. Or, at least, what I think is small. Like if Jason isn't watching what he's doing and knocks something over or spills something, forgets what he was asked to do, etc. I believe in ""pick your battles"".  Especially when he is not on his medication. Bigger problems get bigger consequences, of course. I have ADHD myself and try to gain as much information on the subject as possible to try and understand myself and my son better. I get the struggles he faces. My husband, we'll call him Jerry, thinks I use it as an excuse and that I am not being supportive of him when I offer suggestions as to why or why not our son may have done something. Or maybe  it was just an accident or a mistake, or he didn't know better. I don't say these things in front of our son because I don't want to undermine my husband.

Jerry thinks the best way to discipline Jason is to ""change his life"" by spanking or breaking his things. Jason agrees that breaking his things makes him remember the lesson, but I'm of the position that a 10 year old can't be completely sure what type of discipline he actually needs. I also don't care for spanking, and I'm totally against breaking a child's possessions. 

I took Jason's phone away as a consequence. Jerry keeps allowing him to have it when I'm not around. I complained to Jerry about this, and he basically shrugged it off. 

As another consequence, Jerry took all of Jason's personal belongings out of his room. He was going to smash his TV, but I stopped him. He was upset that I did and claimed I wasn't backing him up.

Jerry also doesn't like the fact that I disagree with his decision not to  allow Jason to have his Christmas  presents this year. He told me to ask my mom's opinion, and she disagreed too. So, naturally, my mom and I are both wrong.

Today, Jerry found an old cellphone in a kitchen drawer. I had seen the phone in the drawer a while ago. Jerry told me that Jason had taken it from another location and had planned on playing with it since his phone had been taken away. I didn't know that Jerry had removed it from the kitchen drawer and put it somewhere else, so I told him Jason must not have moved it recently because I had seen it in the kitchen. 

Jerry took this as me defending Jason. It took us getting into an argument about it for him to finally tell me that he had actually moved it from the kitchen and into the other room, and then Jason moved it back. I told him he should have said that before. He accused me of nitpicking what he said and told me he shouldn't have to explain himself. If he says Jason did something, I should just believe him and ""tear his ass up"" without asking questions. He says a wife wouldn't question her husband. He also said our son was narcissistic and that I needed to choose between the two of them because he ""can't live like this."" Also, I'm the reason our son acts this way because I let it happen. It's not because of ADHD,  etc.

Jerry also tasked Jason with vacuuming, and the vacuum stopped working. A small copper wire that gets power to the motor broke. Jerry thinks it's because Jason pulled the power cord too hard while it was full (shop vac full of water), and it twisted the motor inside enough to break the wire. I said I didn't think so. That, of course, was me defending Jason again.

There is so much more I could say... there have been so many arguments between us about our son. I'm at a loss. Ask me anything. I don't mind answering questions if it helps gain understanding. I am also willing to accept criticism if I'm in the wrong. I really want to know, honestly. I want to do whatever I can to fix my family.


Edit to answer a couple of questions:
1. Yes, he is his biological father.

2. When I say Jason breaks things, I mean he is not careful. I'm not saying he does it on purpose.

3. The pharmacy here frequently is out of stock of Jason's medication and mine. It sometimes takes a couple of weeks before they get a shipment. I'm currently trying to find another nearby that might keep the meds stocked, but I've had no luck yet.

4. When I say I let little things slide, I don't mean I just ignore it, and he gets away with it. I'm saying I don't make a huge deal if he, for example, trips over his own feet and spills his drink. If he were to just straight up pour it on the floor, that would be another thing altogether. That's not something he would do, though.

5. To the person who said my son seems like a ""nightmare"" to everyone but me, that is simply not true. He's honestly a great kid. He's not mean spirited or violent or anything like that. 

6. His negative conduct grades are mainly because of his inability to sit still in his seat and be quiet.

7. One of the reasons I made this post was to prove the point to my husband that I am not the only one who thinks the way I do and to let him see that he is being an asshole.

8. Yes, my husband had a SHIT childhood, and I believe he has a lot of trauma to work through. I've been trying to convince him to seek help. Both his parents and his stepfather all did some pretty messed up stuff to him as a child and both of us as adults. His real father died when he was 16. We cut his mother and stepfather out of our lives 3 years ago. Which is when his mental health seemed to start declining. He has no family left but us.

9. I will do everything I can to protect my son and will do whatever I have to. I already know this shit ain't right.

10. I don't think I explained the phone thing properly. Jason did exactly what Jerry said he did. The thing was that Jerry had left out a bit of important information which made me think he was wrong and he thought I didn't need to know that detail because I should have just believed him in the first place. Sometimes, he thinks Jason has done something wrong, and he is wrong. I don't like to blame a child for something by just assuming they did it without getting all the facts first. Jerry usually assumes the worst. No one wants to be punished for something they didn't do.

11. I might not have explained properly. I don't  excuse his behavioral issues. I just believe there are different levels to the amount of discipline needed for different behaviors.

12. I told my husband in response to the ultimatum t ""Our son isn't going anywhere, so... you do what you gotta do."" I would never have chosen any different. He said he didn't mean it like that."
zt7qdr_6257,zt7qdr,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"My husband (37) and I (36) can't seem to get on the same page when it comes to our 10 year old son. Our son, we'll call him Jason, has ADHD. Jason has a set of specific yet simple chores he must do every day. He frequently does not complete them fully or doesn't do them at all. He is impulsive. He lies to get out of trouble. He gets less than great marks on his conduct reports. He breaks things. He takes things without asking. He's forgetful. He's easily distracted. 

While I know he sounds like a terror,  he's also super sweet and generous and funny and empathetic and creative... I love the kid to death. I mean, he's my son...  His behavior improves when he is on his medication, but it's not perfect. I don't expect that of a 10 year old boy. 

I tend to let small things slide. Or, at least, what I think is small. Like if Jason isn't watching what he's doing and knocks something over or spills something, forgets what he was asked to do, etc. I believe in ""pick your battles"".  Especially when he is not on his medication. Bigger problems get bigger consequences, of course. I have ADHD myself and try to gain as much information on the subject as possible to try and understand myself and my son better. I get the struggles he faces.

ztbsat_6262,ztbsat,op-engaged,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,"For some context, I (28m) is married to Kolia (26m). I have a best friend who's called Max (29m) , that same dude is married to my twin sister, Elsie (28f). Kolia and Max went to the same middle school in our younger age and basically, Max heavily bullied my husband. Enough to have a whole social account dedicated to it which is off today but still, where we could see Max putting Kolia's head in the toilet, or writing mean words on his skin and the basic punching, kicking... That was cruel. My sister and I weren't in the same school, indeed (knowing she and I are japanese and we came to America when we were 13) and never heard about that stuff before high school where we were all together. We weren't living in a big city, that's why we went all to the same high school.

The problem is that Max and I were going along pretty well, he was still being mean to some people (which I don't accept, so we had few arguments back in the time) but was really sweet with me and my sister. He had another best friend back in the time, Malik, which is not very important in the story but who I suspect to be one of the reasons why Max stopped bullying people. In the same time, I met Kolia two years after (since he was younger) in my basketball team where, Max was in. The two boys were kinda tense around one another but Max never tried to touch him again, fortunately. I heard about the bullying in my twenties when we were sharing some deep secrets with my ""boyfriend"" (now husband). I was a bit shaken about that but I didn't annoy Max with that since he really made some progress with my sister, and I felt it was unfair to bite him for past mistakes. Even if that one was a BIG mistake.

Anyway, after all that, Kolia and I decided to get married, and arrived the moment where we had to choose our groomsman (or groomswoman) and chose respectively our siblings and some close friends of ours) but I evicted Max from being one of my groomsman. It was a very hard choice but since my wedding is also Kolia's wedding, that wasn't very nice of my husband to choose someone else over himself for HIS wedding. And I know Kolia told me multiple times that he didn't mind and wasn't affected by that, but I know he always says that and you can never tell if he's really unfazed or just lying. 
I asked my sister, she said she understood my mindset and told me to do as I wanted.

The problem is, now, Max is very hurt about my choice and no matter how much I try to tag along with him hoping to save our friendship , he gives me the cold shoulder. I even heard from Malik that Max doesn't consider me as his friend anymore, which pains me a lot , and that made me wonder if I were the asshole of this story. 

I hope everyone have a nice day,
Goodbye.

PS : All the names choosen are fake to keep everyone anonymous.

UPDATE: Okay, so here's what happened. First of all, I learnt from some of you that Max actually saw my AITA and wrote one to give his own side of this story. I was very embarrassed because I was sure he didn't use Reddit but it seems like my sister showed him my post and he wrote an AITA too. I talked with my husband about it again yesterday and I think he's genuinely unfazed about Max since he actually laughed it off and told me he really didn't mind him and he would have been unbothered whatsoever. I called Max the same day and we had a long conversation. He told me about the AITA (which I read too) and he was a bit freaked out because of the comments and I must admit, some of them were indeed rude and I can understand why.

But I think he doesn't resent me as much as he did before and he apologized, so did I since I think, that I wasn't all right about that, thanks to you mostly. I don't know if we'll remain best friend but we made up in a certain way. We're still friends, at least.

I owe to some of you a big thanks for giving us your advice and also your point of view. I may delete this post since I'm not very comfortable with that piece of information of my and my closed one's private life wandering freely in the internet, although I shouldn't have written that in the first place. I don't like neither the fact that some of my closed ones have access to that and can read that because I find that very immature of me and my pride is touché. (It sounds very childish, I acknowledge that.)

I also want to add, after reading some of the comments in both posts that if Max or/and I can be called AH, my sister clearly isn't one and she's one of the sweetest person I know in my whole life and I read somewhere that my husband was maybe jealous. I'm very surprised that the only person who hadn't done anything wrong here was accused of something like this and I'd like to say that nobody is jealous of anybody here and that it doesn't make any sense. To me, at least. I don't know what to say more about the comments despite some of them claiming it's fake, and it's up to you to think if Max and I are fake, I don't really care since I think this whole problem is finally solved. I'd like to thank you again for the time some of you took to help and to share your opinion about it. Great wishes.

I still hope everyone have a nice day,

ztf2uj_6269,ztf2uj,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"For years my family has lived distantly. My parents still together but my brother and I living far away.

For the first time in over a decade where within 3 hours of each other by car (as opposed to 6 hours by plane) and my parents are coming up to the town my brother and I live in for Christmas.

Last Christmas I joined my parent's for a few days, and it was constant bickering with my father. He's unyielding in every aspect including waking me up at 6:00 in the morning to make me move my car because I drove in forwards instead of backing in and it ""looks untidy"". No kidding here.

I also have Tourette's, I was diagnosed 20 years ago. I move around and make noises and I have zero control over it. Christmas Eve Dinner he snapped ""Stop it!"" every time I ticked and my mum had to talk me out of driving 3 hours home that night. Even my attempt to ask him to read the wikipedia page on (he's a fucking professor of geology he's capable of learning) just grew tension.

I was working in academia and education for some years which he was proud of, but I hated it and was getting depressed so I left it and am currently working a menial job until I figure out my next steps (pretty determined to follow a dream of goldsmithing/metalworking/watch and clock repair - been talking to schools for it recently). I know for a fact he's absolutely livid about this and I am wishing to avoid any and all conversation about it which will inevitably come up. It's all he talks about with me as we share nothing else in common. I know he'll get judgmental and I'll either have to endure it, or stand up for myself and cause a fight.

I've decided to work Christmas at my job purposely to avoid spending it with them. I will miss the fun but that pattern of sniping and tension goes back decades and I always find myself exhausted around that man, and sad after for feeling like I don't have a dad, just a Hall Monitor for a father.

My brother learned of this and blew his lid. Telling me I'm being selfish and ruining Christmas and, I shall quote, ""All your woke friends have put it in your head that family is the enemy. Is this about your sexuality and dad not accepting it? Just don't bring it up and if he bitches just smile and nod until it's over."" citing that he's almost 70 and too old to change (my goal isn't to change him, my goal is to not feel like trash on Christmas Day).

My mum, in gentler words, expressed the same - worrying that the grandkids (my niece and nephew) will wonder where I am.

I'm 35 years old, I can make my own damned decisions. Christmas for the past 20 years has been an emotional chore and each time it's heavier and heavier. I've had enough of it. I posit a 3 year old and a 6 year old who never met me prior to last year will be more focused on presents than their sad uncle.

I can't help but notice that many people in my life - my brother, my mother, apparently a few aunts and uncles, if my brother is to be believed, all think I'm the Asshole here and that it's my duty to just endure my father's constant belittling of me ""for the sake of family unity"".

To them, they think I'm destroying the first full family Christmas since the grandkids were born. But I feel they're refusing to understand my position of feeling more and more like a stranger in my own family. Always the disappointment. Always being barked at by my father with an iron rod up his ass. I just want them to have a good time without me and I can finally have a Christmas that feels good and relaxed.

My GF on the other hand says ""Fuck 'em you don't owe them anything your dad's being a dick."" However she's biased because she grew up in a sexually and physically abusive home so she has trouble understanding my feelings of guilt here."

She helped with groceries when she could and helped to watch my kids if I needed to go out or was working.

I said yes, but it’s temporary he can stay for the summer. Then informed her since they now both had jobs, I needed them to contribute. I asked for $250/month from each of them. So $500 combined. Not a lot but still helping as she is trying to get on her feet. And to keep in mind he needs to be helpful around the house, to which she agreed and told me all the stuff he could help with.
The first few months he was helpful. By august he could no longer work for our parents for a multitude of different reasons every time you asked. This is also when he basically stopped helping with anything around the house and just stayed in their room. All day, all night. This is not ok with me. I asked her to please speak with him, because apparently I intimidate him, because he cannot just stay in the room all the time. He needs to contribute around the house too. Nothing changed. I again brought it up, telling her I was starting to get sour about him for his lack of help and appreciation of everything. (He never says thank you, I cook everyone dinner, he doesn’t even come out for his meal anymore she takes it to him) again nothing changed. Meanwhile I have my oldest making comments about how they help and so more around the house than this 23 year old “man” 
The last straw for me was when we were moving wood to prevent it from being wet and snowed on, everyone was suppose to help, kids too. He didn’t come out. I went in to ask him to come and help, he flat said no he hasn’t slept well this month. To which I have no sympathy because he is up playing video games all night.
So finally I went down to speak to them together. 
I calmly asked if he liked living here, he says yes. I said ok, I like you and think you are a nice guy, and if you are having issues with sleep you need to see a doctor about it, but I need you to be more present and help around the house with stuff. You guy said you would when you moved in, and that has stopped. It also bothers me a bit that you don’t come out and at the least say thank you for the meals I cook and the food that you eat. 
To which he rolls his eyes at me, and says full of attitude “Well what do you expect me to do” needless to say it for more heated after that and he started yelling and raising his voice at me. I’ll admit I did yell back because now I’m mad, I’m doing this kid a favor and this is how he acts when I am wanting to hold him accountable for what he agreed to. So finally I just tell him, if you cannot  follow through with these minor requests of things you originally agreed to, then you have to move out next month. I refuse to feel like I’m being used by someone who I’m doing a favor for like this. I walked away to him yelling I cannot break them up because I don’t like him. It has nothing to do with that. My sister came out a few hours later telling me she loved me and hugged me, and I said it did not need to escalate to that. All he had to do was say yes ok I’ll try. End of discussion. She says we will have to figure something out then. I said no, unless he apologizes to me for being disrespectful it doesn’t matter what you figure out. He is not welcome here. The month is almost up and she says to our mother that he won’t apologize for he did nothing wrong. My sister obviously doesn’t want me to kick him out but I honestly will not be able to get past this if he doesn’t apologize. This is my house I pay all the bills here and I will not have someone I’m doing a favor for because of my sister speak to me that way. So AITA here because in a couple days  if he hasn’t packed his stuff and left I’ll be calling the police to have him removed, and my sister is aware of this because I told her as such."

I (29M), was bestfriend with M. (28M). 
I married E. (28F), his twinsister a few years ago. 
M. was (and is still dating) K. (26M). 

K. proposed to M. few months ago, and their wedding was held a few weeks ago. Me and my wife were obviously invited, and she was chosen as a groom's woman, but I wasn't, despite my very close bond with the groom. Of course, I was mad, and we talked about the issue. M. told me that he avoided choosing me as his groom's man because I had some issues with his partner when we were in Middle School. 

In fact, I used to bully him a lot, which was a very shitty move and I admit it and holds responsability for it. I stopped bullying him when we got in High School (bullied him from 6th to 8th Grade). I since apologized for my behavior (on numerous occasions) and tried to make up for it, which worked, and I'm now friend with K. He doesn't have any issues with me anymore, and I obviously matured. 

Despite all that, M. still didn't want to take me as his groom's man, which deeply hurt me as we're bestfriends. 

I didn't come to his wedding, and am now not talking to him anymore for that matter. (He still comes home pretty often, since my wife is his sibling, and I stay polite towards him.) 

So, am I the asshole?

Every year we (myself, husband, two kids) go to my parents in law for Christmas. We take the kids over late Christmas eve, wake up there on Christmas morning, open presents, play, eat and come home after dinner time.

Today we went over with some food and presents to make the trip tomorrow night a little less stressful.

My son (9m) was misbehaving, refusing to be involved in conversation, ignoring questions etc. I was unimpressed and tried to explain to him how this can be hurtful to his grans feelings who doesn't get to see him all that often.

Usually my in laws keep out of parenting/discipline, and we get on really well. But today my MIL threatened my son with 'santa won't come to you if you don't listen to your mum'. I just outright told her she can't be making threats like that, it's a ridiculous thing to suggest. Of course santa will come. She said she was trying to help and it worked when her kids were little. She got really upset and started to cry when I told her never to make threats on my behalf that I'd never be able to follow through with. It undermines me and my son will never take me seriously if I can't follow through with discipline. I don't think I was rude, I did explain my logic but I also wanted to make it clear that it's not up to her to decide on what is/isn't an appropriate consequence to my sons behaviour. 

Obviously when they look after him, it's they're rules. But some things just shouldn't be suggested when there's no way it can be stuck to.

My husband says I'm an asshole, but I stand by what I said. AITAH?"

Or that’s at least what she says. Either way we were eating dinner one night as they invited us over. We soon got into a discussion about marriage. My sister was speaking about how she or my brother should walk me down the isle. Robert chimed in and said “Of course I’ll be the one to walk her down the isle. It only makes sense.” This started an argument. Ending with me telling everyone to be quiet, especially because I don’t even know if I want to get married. I told all of them that my sisters or my brother would walk me down the isle because I don’t even know Robert that well and his comment was full of disrespect. I then looked at my stepmom and told her that the actions she has used is disrespectful to my father and my family. And that whenever I get the chance to I’m never speaking to her again. That it was wrong for her to date another guy not even 6 months after my fathers death. I then left and haven’t spoken to her since. But she keeps messaging me telling me that I was in the wrong. I absolutely don’t think that but I want another perspective on this. So AITA?

Update: Rachel officially moved out of Roberts house. Turns out that Robert actually hit my stepmother and he children. They are now staying with me and are perfectly okay. She says that she will make sure Robert is arrested. She explained the only reason that she did not speak up is because Robert would hurt her later on. She explained that she was seeing Robert before my dad passed and that she was in the wrong for doing so. Turns out Robert had many assault charges that she did not know about. She has also told me that I should not forgive any of her actions. But I do forgive her. Though it was wrong to cheat on my father, she had been through enough. She said it had begun when she ran into Robert (they knew each other in high school). My father could not go on this vacation because of work. Robert got her drunk and took her to his hotel while my stepsister(18f) watched the kids. My siblings are only 18, 13, and 11. They were confused and knew barely anything. Robert lived a town over and about 3 months after my fathers death they moved in with Robert. We have everything settled now.

My husband is military. We bought our home last year just in case he got deployed or unaccompanied orders somewhere. So in the meantime, when we weren't living there, my brother in law and his wife were living in the house. They aren't paying rent but they pay all of the bills. The mortgage is more than 2 times what all of the bills combined are.
We just moved back yesterday and brought our cats with us. They said that there is a cat piss smell on our stuff, which definitely shouldn't be the case. They claimed that this is the reason why they don't want to put the heat on, even though it is -20 degrees out right now as we are in the middle of a snow storm. I also can't turn it on myself as there is a code on the thermostat...

I know that he will not pay to get the pipes repaired if they burst from not being warm enough."

“Wanna play truth or dare?” he said
“Uhm sure i guess” i replied back.
The game started off normal, we asked each-other random questions like what their fav thing was or asking the other if they had done __. A little bit into it i picked dare.
“Is it okay if its a bit naughty?” he asked me. I was curious by what he meant. “Wdym??”
“Send me a video of you licking your fingers.” Oh boy.. i’ve been down this road before. I sent him a random photo of a naked grandma on the internet and we moved on. I feel like that should’ve been my sign to block him. But we continued, and he kept daring me to send videos, photos, voice messages, etc. At this point i was tired so i went off on him. I told him to stop once and he didn’t respect it. After it cooled down i blocked him. No big deal right? No. It was to him. His friends made a group chat and they started sending me hateful messages, calling me names, telling to to k**l myself, etc. It has me thinking, was i wrong to just block him and not try to work things out?

PSA: i made it clear at the very start of the convo i wasn’t gonna do anything weird and i told him i had a boyfriend and i was a minor and i didn’t want anything more than a friendship.

zuafnl_6324,zuafnl,op-engaged,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I (21M) live with my grandparents. This year we are hosting Christmas dinner in our house and my younger cousins are coming over.

I enjoy spending time with my cousins but the age gap between myself (21) and my oldest cousin (17F) is 4 years. Due to this while we do talk and get along with one another we don’t have a lot in common. After her my second oldest cousin (15F) which is an even larger age gap. Then my younger cousins are (13F,8F,5M,1F).

Typically at family events I’d chill with my brothers who are unable to attend this year.

Which brings me to my issue. My family’s pretty chill, the drinking age in the UK is 18 so myself and my 17yo cousin will most likely be drinking and sitting with family. However, my gran is demanding I have my room prepared for my younger cousins.

Her reasoning is that it will give them a place to be out of the adults way after dinner and will allow us to be able to drink in peace.

I hate the idea of people in my room without me there. I have a lot of technology stuff which consists of my ps5, tv, laptop and work laptop. All this stuff are out in the open and I don’t want to risk it being damaged. And while it’s pretty childish I have some Lego build up from when I was a kid on display that can be easily broken. I’d say my cousin 13 and upwards are ok but my younger cousins have a tendency to play fight, throw things and not respect boundaries. 

At this I told my gran while my room will be prepared for my cousins if I don’t feel like going up to my room they won’t be allowed into it. I thought this would be pretty reasonable since it’s my bedroom. At this I was called selfish and told that I should just allow them to hang out in my room and let them use my PlayStation to entertain them.

I was pretty firm in saying no as I don’t want my belongings at risk as I paid for mostly everything myself and was once again called selfish for this.

I feel bad and that I may put a damper on things tomorrow. So AITAH?"

At this I was called selfish and told that I should just allow them to hang out in my room and let them use my PlayStation to entertain them.

I was pretty firm in saying no as I don’t want my belongings at risk as I paid for mostly everything myself and was once again called selfish for this.

I feel bad and that I may put a damper on things tomorrow. So AITAH?"

His mother has not picked him up in over a week and picks him up once a week to see him. She does have residential custody. Well he is upset because we refuse to drive in this weather to bring him to her for Christmas. With the weather I believe it is unsafe to take him out and told her when the driving ban is lifted and roads plowed we will bring him to her. She insists that she will come in her car to get him. My response was he is not leaving this house if it’s to dangerous.  She is saying her family needs time with him as well which I don’t disagree with but we also offered on Friday morning to bring him to her but she was out with her boyfriend and said no I can’t take him.

zuqiux_6365,zuqiux,top-comment,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Hello people of Reddit, I’m new to posting here… but needed opinions, so here it goes.

I (F22) recently started dating my boyfriend (M28) about a month ago, so it’s a fairly new relationship. Everything has been amazing so far, he treats me right and I really do like him. But, there is one issue. We recently started talking about out relationship and what we both are look for in our partners. He brought up that he is quite a sex driven person, as to me who is very much the opposite. I think it’s not necessarily needed to be intimate with someone. So here’s where I think an open relationship might work out for us. First, it’ll allow him to get the pleasure he desires, and keep the both of us happy.  Second, I won’t have to feel guilty about not being able to not meet his needs, and it’ll be less stressful for me to figure out when I’m actually ready to be vulnerable. Third, I really care about him and I don’t want to just end everything so soon, because I know there are options and solutions we can come to. So, WIBTA?"

I try explaining but they wont listen to the reasoning, and start ranting about how im the untrust worthy person and start digging into me about cheating.

To make a long story short i blocked both of them and we broke up, they start posting on instagram about how im the bad guy and turn a good 80% of my friends against me, but am i the A-hole for playing along?"

Normally, I would receive an extra present, since I havent finished school yet, as Well as each of nephews.

I get that you put the children first, but AITA for being upset about being forgotten?

I think I might be the AH because of being more focused on the presents then on the family

zv3jxr_6384,zv3jxr,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"**A little background first:**

We have been married for 15 years and share one child.  She had a daughter under 10 from another relationship when we met.  The father had abandoned them even before she was born and although she seemed like a pretty normal child, she was scarred because of the rejection and absence of a father.

We fell in love and I said that I wanted to give her daughter the father she never had.  For the past 15 years I did that.  I am ***not*** perfect and I have screwed up my fair share of times, but she is now an adult, is responsible, a college graduate (mostly thanks to her mother pushing her) and is in a stable relationship.

My wife is religious.  I am not an atheist, but I don't attend church when she goes to mass. She has always said that 'God' illuminates her and guides her.

&amp;#x200B;

**To the heart of the matter:**

Recently I received proof that my wife was in an ongoing affair for at least the last 3 months. I confronted her about it, she admitted it after I knew too many details.  Although it was her affair, I left the house because I didn't want to separate her from our kids, but could not stand to be in the same space with her.  I didn't go far and I still have regular contact with the kids.

When we talked about what she had done I said I had proof and quoted specific things she said so she would understand that I was not bluffing.  I called her a few names (no profanity) and told her something like:

**""You** ***will*** **tell our daughter what you did so she does not think that she was abandoned by two fathers in her life.  So that she knows why I left.  Because I am not the type of person you are...I will extend you the courtesy of telling her in any way you wish as long as you don't lie about me or the specifics.  If you don't tell her or you lie...I will let her hear it from your lips in your voice and let the judgement fall where it may""**.

Don't get me wrong.  I had a good portion of the fault that our marriage fell apart, but I never abused her or the kids (either physically or mentally).  I was never unfaithful and I was always up front about anything I thought we needed to discuss.  During the past few months when her behavior changed I sat her down several times and offered her offramps:  ""hon, what's going on? Why are you acting so indifferent? Did I do something to offend you?, talk to me.""  And she didn't take a single one.

A few weeks before I discovered the affair I had a conversation with our daughter and asked if she noticed the change in her mother's behavior?  She said she didn't notice much difference, but specifically said **""whatever it is...don't worry, mom would never cheat on you...ever!"".**

So to be honest, I made her do it for two reasons.  The one above which, is more altruistic, but I have to admit that there was a moderate amount of ""I want our daughter to see who she really is"" and hold up a mirror to her ""holier than though"" personna.

~~We are still in communication and trying to figure out what, if any our future will be~~, but one thing she has told me is that she is mad at me for making her talk to her daughter about it when it should have been something just between us.

&gt;*The statement above is no longer true.  Not that it alters the topic of this post, but I thought I would correct it as I have now realized (by her continued contact with AP) that the only one serious about 'R' was me. I am proceeding with 'D'.*

I like to think of myself as always trying to see both sides of an argument, but I can't see past my feelings of betrayal on this one, so I'm coming to you for judgement.  Am I the @$$hole for making her disclose it?"

I didn’t dress up as it was only a local restaurant and we were going straight home with the baby after. I had minimal makeup, casual hair down. Wearing an oversized jumper, leggings and boots. He asked me multiple times in front of sister and bf if I was going to make more of an effort. I said no and asked if he planned to. My sister and her bf looked visibly uncomfortable (at what he said, not me). 
Later told him, when on our own, that I didn’t like him asking that repeatedly. I felt embarrassed and that he was comparing me to my sister (who had made more of an effort as was going out for drinks after). He said he wasn’t and knows I would normally make an effort. I explained I wasn’t feeling great and it wasn’t a fancy dinner. He says he “only asked three times”. It was more than that but I let it go. 

Today, it was Xmas and we had family over. I did make an effort today with my outfit and makeup. He asked me tonight, in front of everyone, if I’d done my eyebrows. He then went on repeatedly in front of everyone about how it looks like I’m angry as one of my eyebrows has been arched at him all day. My sister told him if he kept going he’d give me a complex and to stop. I joked it off saying I can’t do right either way. 

In the car home, he got angry and defensive when I brought it up again to talk about how it made me feel. Apparently I’m the arsehole for questioning him and he can’t have fun with me anymore. I’ve said I don’t think that is the case, I just don’t want to be criticised openly and consistently in front of my family. He does have a weird sense of humour but I feel like he took this too far.

My incredible, kind, caring, beautiful grandmother lost her battle to bladder cancer a little over 3 months ago. In her will, myself and two of my older cousins were left her earrings and they're to be split equally between the three of us. 

However, my aunt wants to give a pair of earrings to one of my younger cousins because she wasn't left anything. The two older cousins and I are more then happy to give the younger cousin a pair, but after we choose the ones we like as they were left to us. 

But my aunt has tried to be sneaky and is trying to make sure that the younger cousin gets a very specific pair of earrings. But myself and the two older cousins want to choose which earrings we want to give the younger cousin. And I've just had a sneak peak at some of the earrings (I know I probably shouldn't have but both of my parents said that I could) and as it turns out the one pair I really like are the ones my aunt wants to give the younger cousin. But I can't stress enough that the younger cousin wasn't left any earrings in the will and she was given some of my nans charms from her bracelet. But I can't help but wonder if I would be TA if I chose those earrings to keep?"

Flash forward to today and he didn't show up. My other cousin asked why and I told her. She texted him and then he started complaining to everyone who showed up saying that I wouldn't allow his dog. Some of my family members then got mad at me. They said that I should have just put my rabbits in a bedroom and let the dog in the rest of my house. If I had done that, I would have been in high anxiety mode the whole time, not being able to take my eyes off the bedroom door or the dog as I've seen dogs chew doors and people let animals through doors when they walk through (especially kids). I really do not feel like setting boundaries for what can and can't come into your home is bad but I feel like a lot of people see rabbits as second class pets who don't matter.

He said that he couldn't host so I told him that he could come if he could leave his dog at his home for a few hours or find a place for them to stay and the conversation ended there. Flash forward to today and he didn't show up. My other cousin asked why and I told her. She texted him and then he started complaining to everyone who showed up saying that I wouldn't allow his dog. Some of my family members then got mad at me. They said that I should have just put my rabbits in a bedroom and let the dog in the rest of my house. If I had done that, I would have been in high anxiety mode the whole time, not being able to take my eyes off the bedroom door or the dog as I've seen dogs chew doors and people let animals through doors when they walk through (especially kids). I really do not feel like setting boundaries for what can and can't come into your home is bad but I feel like a lot of people see rabbits as second class pets who don't matter. They are my world and I would never forgive myself if something happened."

My husband did a lot of the coordination and physical work, while I (32F) still worked, looked after kids, ran the household (cooking, pets etc), handled finances and building admin like getting quotes. 

My husband had a serious accident with several significant internal injuries. Big operation, was in hospital for 10 days, and then literally laid on the couch extremely unwell for 4 mths (he had several follow up surgeries in that time). 

It was unclear at the time whether he would fully recover or have life-long problems. 

At the time of his accident, we had no roof on the house, and it was summer/Christmas shut down here in Australia. I needed to get some painting and other tasks done before the roof went on in early January. 
With no tradespeople available, I begged all our friends, my-in-laws and all our acquaintances for help so I could juggle it all. 
(I have no family in Australia). 

My in laws opted not to help: not an hour of child minding, not a meal dropped off, no help with the renovation project. They decided that I was wildly exaggerating and they were busy with their own lives. 
...anyway, with the help of friends, I got the prep done, roof went onto the house. Kids somehow had food and clean clothes each day and even wrapped Christmas gifts. I even managed to visit my husband in hospital briefly to make him feel settled. 

Now, I don't feel like hanging out with my in laws. They weren't there for me when I truly needed them. They just made zero effort for me, they didn't even call or text to check in.

My husband says they aren't great but are the only family he has, it's a while ago now and I should suck it up. 

He is welcome to see them, but when I can, I prefer to not go along.

So a couple of weeks ago me (f 17) and my step brother (m 18) decided to hang out since we had nothing to do. We planed to just go shopping at the mall and go check out a new kbbq/ hot pot place that opened near us. Well my aunt (f 31) has been staying at my house  for a while and it's been kinda rough having our own time to just be ourselves so we were exited to just have some time to yell frank ocean lyrics in the car and look for cute people outside, you know teenage things. As we were headed out the door in our Sundays best my aunt asked where we were going and we gladly told her about our plans. Well she asked if she could go to and since this was like our one time we wanted to just be teenagers we made up an excuse hoping she would just be like ok and not go but she persisted. And i mean she literally begged so not wanting to say no in fear of being seen as disrespectful we said yes and she came with us. On the car ride to the mall she complained about the music being to sad which like yeah I guess because we were in fact listening to Frank ocean so we change it to kpop since it's less sad and she complained again. She also complained about the air being to cold and made us turn the heat on as she turned the window down and began smoking in my car even after i told her not to. My car still smells like her nasty cigarettes but whatever back to the story. At the mall she began to act so rude to everyone, she yelled at the people working for the smallest things she even called them stupid when they couldn't find stuff in her size. Over all it was a horrible experience and I'm ashamed and embarrassed especially since that was the mall i work at.  Well finally we had gotten to the part we all anticipated the bbq and hot pot. We went in and it was like heaven on earth, in that moment i wanted to thank god for Asian coulter and prayed for my wallets Sanity because i was about to be broke after this. It was all you can eat and me and my brother got the bbq and my aunt got the hot pot. The meal was devin I was so happy. The waitress came over and asked how we wanted the check and i said to split it so me and my brother were on one and my aunt was on another. When I said that my aunt gave me the most atrocious look i have ever seen. We paid and left and in the car my aunt began to yell at me for not paying for her. She told me that i was so selfish for only paying for my brother, she complained that she didn't have that much money and also called me disrespectful. Mind you this woman stoped paying for my meals, meals she invited me to when I was 13. Anytime she invited me anywhere i paid for my food and she never paid for mine and even before that i can only remember two times she paid for me and those times it was so she could brag to her friends. Anyways i tell her that the only reason I paid for my brother was because i owed him and also that she hasn't paid for any of my meals she's invited me to and so i won't pay for her.  Well the next day she told my entire family and they all were absolutely pissed, some of them even going as far as calling my step brother slurs.  They all keep calling me ungrateful and disrespectful because i should be paying for my aunt and how i care about people who aren't even family more than i care about my own family. Which to set it straight my step bro is my family we've been besties since day one and he's by far more my family than my actual family. Yeah but anyways amitheasshole??"

zvlv7w_6430,zvlv7w,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"Hey guys. 

So several months back my (27M) girlfriend (32F) and I had an argument and she changed her Facebook relationship status to show single.

I didn’t say anything about it until a few weeks later when she made a comment about being my gf. I brought it up saying “thought you broke up with me thru Facebook”. 

She argues that she didn’t and she never changed anything. We take a look at her activity log, it shows the status change on the day of the argument a few hours later.

She claims to have never changed it. We had an argument about that, because I am convinced she is lying to me and I don’t like being lied to. How else would it have changed if not for her? No one else has access to her phone. 

Well we never resolved that argument, and today we were arguing about the drain cover for the sink being missing because she dropped a screw down the drain by accident (don’t ask how). She says she doesn’t remember moving it and that transitioned into the discussion about her not remembering the Facebook relationship status change.

Which she is still adamant that she did not change the status, despite the evidence to the contrary. I have asked her what other explanation there is but she just asks “why would I have changed it” 

So I’m frustrated. Because I feel like she is treating me like an idiot, gaslighting me and making me seem like the asshole for calling her out for lying. 

But she is adamant that she does not remember changing it, that it’s not something she would do, that she does not believe she changed it, and says why does it matter anyways its just Facebook.

So, AITA for not believing her?"

We have week on/week off, 50/50 custody of his daughter. Everytime we get his daughter back shes always sick, runny nose, high temperature, always ends up needing to go to the drs and needing medicine. So our whole week with his daughter is spent getting her better just to go back to her mums and get sick again....it's a never ending revolving door. Lately it's been doing my head in, I'm getting pretty angry and over it. Her mum gets the ""mum title"" but im doing all the work, like getting things ready for her to start school, taking her to drs ect while her mum doesn't do anything.
We've tried talking to her mum about this but she won't text back or just closes the door in our faces. Both my partner and I are getting pretty sick of it and I'm beyond angry over the whole situation. Like I said earlier my partner and I have 2 kids ourselves 23 months and 6 months old and I feel like her mum gets a week off and I just get added responsibility and stress trying to care for two young kids and caring for a sick child.

So Aita?

Edit: the child is 5 years old. We've had her tested at the drs for allergies - no allergies. We've had bloods taken and the only thing that came back was low iron from not having enough red meat, We've told her mum about all this and she seems she doesn't care. She's also gets sick from ear infections, throat infections, so she requires drs visit and medicine. Her mum doesn't believe in antibiotics or taking her to drs and has asked us why does she need them all the time....Also from what I have witnessed at drop offs/pick ups her mums house is always dirty and smells gross. Bonus daughter also has mentioned she's seen mice at her mums house. So hopefully this clears up any questions."

A few years later, I meet and marry my 2nd ex. From 2-6 yrs old, I had visitation sporadically. Between my work and our 2 foster daughters, I can't afford to see her often. Every time my daughter visits, she's CHAOS. Screaming, crying, tantrums, night terrors, bedwetting, breaking things then lying and claiming she didn't even though our foster daughters say she did. 

My 2nd ex &amp; I adopted our 2 foster daughters. On her last visit to see us, I sit my daughter down (shes 6 at the time), show her their adoption paperwork. She doesn't understand what I'm showing her. Later, our house burns down, &amp; I discover my ex has put a lean on my house for some child support payments I had forgotten to pay. My 2nd ex and my ex are pushing for me to give up my rights to my daughter. I signed away my rights and let her stepdad adopt her. Shortly after that, the adoption for our other 2 daughters is finalized. 

I spent years in therapy. The therapist I saw for agreed it's for the best that I gave up custody. When my daughter turned 18, I messaged her on facebook. She wants nothing to do with me.

Four years later, my daughter reaches out to me. She's estranged herself from her mom &amp; stepdad. She tells me that her mom drinks &amp; that she was abused in various ways by her mom and stepdad. She couldn't remember anything from the 7 years she had with me-not one thing. 

I told her to have no expectations of me to avoid disappointment. She's married &amp; I was glad to have a son in law since I never got to have a son. My son in law is estranged from his side of the family as well. I understand what it's like to have a crappy childhood. I told my daughter to take good care of him.

I invited them to fly out here to spend a week camping with me, my fiancee, and my fiancee's college age daughters. She says money's tight since she's in school but they'll figure it out, &amp; they buy plane tickets to fly here. I tell her that someday when she has a kid I'll fly to see them.

I asked about her life but she seemed depressed. She said she was on medication for the depression and seeing a therapist to work through the trauma from her mom. I told her all about my fiancee's daughters &amp; my fiancee. I told her that my 2 adoptive daughters don’t speak to me. I let her know that she was always my favorite. 

The first week my daughter contacted me, my fiancee told me she was starting to feel a little insecure at how often I was talking to my daughter, so I told my daughter I would message her on my lunch breaks at work &amp; call her on my drives home from work. 

My fiancee started messaging her on a regular basis and let her know that she'll be her new mom. My fiancee had a rough upbringing &amp; her ex was an addict, her life was traumatic and she was telling her about it all. Suddenly my daughter messages her back and tells her ""Can we talk about other things? I'd love to get to know you"". It was so dismissive &amp; arrogant. My fiancee came to me in tears.

zwq78y_6465,zwq78y,top-comment,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"EDIT: Anyone who’s actually been apart of the music industry knows that it’s a largely misogynistic and male dominated industry. Please keep that in mind while reading this post:

 The lead singer of the band I was in had been flirting with me, taking me on dates, inviting me places alone, calling me beautiful and sexy, and excessively touching and grabbing me for months. I’m the only girl in the group but I’m also Polyamorus and in an open relationship (with two partners) so I was like whatever even though there was a part of me that felt uncomfortable not knowing what his intentions were, plus I’m not a super touchy feely person. Then he has the nerve to tell me I was crossing HIS boundaries and flirting with HIM just because I had the nerve to ASK HIM WHAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE. He literally accused me of being unprofessional and of trying to get him to cheat on his girlfriend (one of my friends) even though he said they were in an open relationship (not that it matters because I don’t date my coworkers and I wasn’t into him like that- if anything I was weirdly crushing on his girl but that’s neither here nor there) I was kicked out of the band (via text), I posted it, and  - few other messages, and A few people unfollowed me. It’s just fucking embarrassing because even though I felt like he was in the wrong, he has all the power because he started the band and I look like some raging bitch or even worse a scorned ex lover (when I’m neither). I’m so sad and angry. I feel so alone and even my best friend in the world doesn’t care (well that’s not totally true she’s busy with her own life and healing and I love her for it). My boyfriends are both super sweet and helpful but they’re men. I just want a woman/femme to cry with. Was I wrong to post these?

Edit: I had been talking to my partners about what to do for a while before I decided to post. At first I wasn’t going to post them, but then he kicked me out of the band for no reason, and to no knowledge of our other band mates (even though we usually make choices like that together). I didn’t want him going around telling them something happened that didn’t happen, so I thought it would be better to be transparent and show everyone exactly what was said. I didn’t want anything he claimed I said to be used against me especially when I went out of my way to a written record of our confrontation. ALSO to clarify I was kicked out of the band BEFORE I posted the messages. But not everyone knew and I wanted to make sure everyone knew it wasn’t my decision.
EDIT: WE WERE NEVER DATING AND I DID NOT WANT TO DATE HIM. WE WENT OUT FOR FOOD AND TO A FEW SHOWS AND DID A FEW OTHER THINGS TOGETHER. I did not reciprocate his advances but I didn’t actively try to stop them. I thought we were friends but then it got weird so I asked him about it."
zwqzs2_6470,zwqzs2,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Disclaimer this isn’t my story, it’s my mom’s. I want to see if ppl say the same thing i tell her all the time.

I (52F) been with my husband (43M) for 19yrs. We have 2 children together and my oldest is his stepdaughter. My husband is very toxic to all of us. When my oldest was 7, he would bully her and even hit her. I would step in cuz that is my child and she’s only 7. It would lead to the 2 of us fighting in front of my other 2 daughters.

My husband would also bully me and call me fatty. He wouldn’t put his hands on me, but there has been times where he has. Every action he has done to me would lead to us having a giant fight and not speak to each other for 3 days.

As the years go by, my husband would harrass and bully my oldest over the most stupidest things. When she turned 18, he drove her out with a huge fight. So my oldest moved out from it, and now he’s bullying my middle child (13F). He would call her pimple face, yell at her for not tying her shoes, call her lazy. It always hurt seeing my children cry cuz of him. Everything he does and say to all of us would lead to me and him fighting.

Today after a fight from last night made my husband send me nasty messages while at work telling me that i need to pay for our youngest birthday and that i need to return the new shoes i got to afford for her birthday cuz hes broke. Mind u, hes the cheapest AH ik. He only said he would chip in 40 bucks but that’s all. My youngest (12F) is gonna be mad. She doesn’t deserve that."

zwu72n_6484,zwu72n,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,"First post so feel free to coach me on etiquette or anything else. 

I am 40 and my wife of just under a year is 42. She recently became pregnant. We are both excited and a little nervous. This is the first child for both of us. I want to quit my job and that thought makes her irate. I feel like she is being a little selfish and she feels like I am making her take care of all of the parental obligations for our daughter. 

Background:

I worked hard and made a lot of sacrifices in my 20’s to accumulate assets with the goal of getting out from under the thumb of corporate America someday. I have finally reached the point where I no longer feel that I should have to work a job that I do not care for. I quit my last job in February to take a bucket list trip with my father to Alaska for 6 months. My plan was to return to the workforce upon returning but to be very choosy about what I did- even if it means less money. I took a job for 130k a year in November because we learned she was pregnant and I am not happy at work. For perspective, we live in Chattanooga and the cost of living is quite reasonable. I brought some rental properties that generate a conservative 80k a year in passive net income and a small dive bar/restaurant that conservatively gives us free food, business travel, and alcohol but not much true realized income (yet) into the marriage.  I have some non-income producing debt and 2 mortgages out of the 4 properties I own.  The mortgages are serviced by the properties and are accounted for in the 80k net. I have around 400k in a retirement account.  I consider myself to need little in life and am happy driving used vehicles, etc. 

She does well, also working for corporate America in logistics. Her income is more than mine plus bonuses. She spent her twenty’s doing more partying than saving and her salary just went up a couple of years ago so she did not bring any passive forms of income into the marriage. She is a great saver though and has around 200k between her 401k and other investments. 

When I told her I wanted to quit she became very anxious and irate. My pov is that this child pretty much has it made and that happy parents are going to be more important than extra income. 

Am I the asshole?"

zwufdl_6491,zwufdl,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,"I’m sorry in advance, this will be all over the place since it’s a lot.
 I (22f) recently came to terms with the lie that I’ve been living. **There will be trigger warnings **My boyfriend (23m) has been trying to help me realize what’s been occurring the last two years but I have always been so desperate to have my mom that I couldn’t see it. It took her putting my life in danger once again for me to finally start opening my eyes and diving deeper into all of her manipulation and deception. 

Example 1: 
When I was five, my parents separated. From that point, my mom has filled my head with how awful of a person my dad was, there was never a time of us being together that she didn’t talk badly about him. She formed my perspective of my dad by doing so, anytime he’d mess up she’d feed off of that to pursue her agenda. I recently realized he was never the person she painted him out to be, she was mirroring everything she was doing onto him. 
She tried making me accuse him of r*ping me when he never did.

Example 2: 
When I was 7 I believe, she started dating a psychopath. He stalked us, ab*sed us, tried to k*ll us, tried kidnapping me, k*lled my rabbit, etc. she ended up losing custody of me. Mixed with all of the neglect she was doing, the dr*gs, and whatnot. 
He ended up going to prison. As soon as he was released(he was in for around 10 years), she was back in contact with him. She was in a relationship with him again in 2018 and I had told her to stop choosing bad guys over her kids or she’d eventually lose us. She always chose abusive or guys struggling with drug addiction over her kids. And I always forgave her and looked past that because I wanted a mom.

In 2020 she was being evicted from her house. My boyfriend and I decided to help her, we bought land together and a house, which she eventually got her own little house added onto the land. She immediately invited him over and manipulated me into believing that he was the only one who’d help with the water connection. She’s always had a way of painting herself as a victim and making others feel sorry for her. He tried stealing from us and she claimed she cut him off. Then in November of 2022 she picked up his dog to babysit and hid it from us. She finally admitted that she had his dog and was in contact with him again.
I finally realized she’ll always choose him over her kids. I realized how much danger that I am in with both of them.

Example 3: 
She manipulated me into helping her hide out. Ever since I was a kid she taught me that I needed to protect her. She owes over 35k to child support, she commits tax fraud and she lies about having a disability to receive additional income. 
She works 3-5 days a week cleaning houses and puts her checks in my name or has them pay in cash to hide that she makes an income. She convinced me to put her car and insurance in my name since she no longer could register it in her name due to child support debt.

Example 4:
She’s been living off of us all of 2022. She pays around $120 each month while we pay over $2,000 and we can’t afford it anymore. We pay her phone, her house, her car insurance, her dish, the water bill, the dog food (250 a month), etc. she’s drowning us while we’re trying to start our lives and doesn’t care.

At this point I feel like to stay safe I need to turn her in, I feel like she doesn’t care if I d*e or go to jail for her. But I still feel guilty for it. All I’ve ever done is protect her and keep her secrets and I don’t know how to not feel guilty for protecting myself finally.

So, AITA for debating on turning her in?"

I (27m) am planning to ask my partner to marry me on new years eve. Unfortunately it has been a rough year for us both as my mother passed away earlier in the year and my partner has been diagnosed with functional seizure disorder not long after. 

Unfortunately my plans were found out by my partner by accident when my future father in law accidently left somthing out when my partner came to visit and she was cleaning up for him (he has back trouble and some days are worse then others) Unfortunately said thing basicly spilt the whole bag of beans but good news was my partner after the initial disappointment of not getting that dream supprise moment decided we can have a whole family event for it on new years for after we get back. 

Well I felt bad that there was no surprise for my partner, but I knew she was really upset that my godmother whom we are very close with couldn't make it due to distance. Well my partner assumed wrong and I set about sneacking my godmother into town , planned weeks before I told My family it was to be a surprise and swore them to silence.

Now my sister (29F) has always had the annoying habit of needing to be the person that always organises EVERYTHING as well as having to always be the one to pick people up , I have never been allowed to pick my own godmother up once , it always had to be her or tantrums were never far away. I was once again against this but for the sake of happy family I went with it mainly to please our dad.

Fast forward to Christmas day we are all sitting around the table and dad was talking to my partner and I about numbers for new years as he is holding the family thing at his house as it is rather spacious, he told my partner who he knew was coming minus the surprise guests. But my sister with the biggest shit eating grin on her face says whilst staring me in the eye , oh and aunty and uncle - godmother.

I was ropeable but I held my anger in as the rest of my family minus my dad looked set to back hand her, and we leave soon after, my surprise in tatters.

My partner and I started talking then and we decided since there is no surprise now we may as well be the ones to pick them up since it's our special time, but when I rang my sister to brake the news she screamed and wailed that she had already taken time off work and it wasn't deliberate that she blabbed. I told her I didn't care and that she should have been more careful about what she said. My dad thinks we are doing this as a payback and maybe we should reconsider because he doesn't want the ""drama"" but I feel this is worth standing up for because she has always been daddy's little girl and he can't see she is a selfish little so and so .....

zx1nx0_6512,zx1nx0,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"     Before assuming, here’s a little background. I 20F decided to help my longtime friend 20F with paying her wedding dress. The wedding dress was $709. She put $110 into it, My brothers Ex-girlfriend put $220 into it and said don’t worry about paying her back because it was her wedding gift, while I put $379 into it and that’s not including the money for gas that I used to doordash to get some of the money to pay for the dress, making the total that I’ve put into it around $400, the other $31 being a low estimate for the gas used to get the dress. I had told her that she only had to pay me back $200, because the other $200 would be her wedding gift. Now you all may be wondering why I had put that much money towards her wedding dress. 

     Her family has been very unsupportive of her decision and refused to help, even though they have admitted that they could but refused to do so. We then decided that the dress would stay with me because my place is a smoke, kid and animal free home. Which means no chance of the dress getting ruined. 

     Anyways, she said she would pay me back on a certain date, but when they date came around, she made an excuse that she couldn’t pay me for certain reasons. At that point I had asked her to just be honest with me and tell me if she wasn’t able to pay me back. I wouldn’t be upset and I would just call it a day and cut my losses. She would have her dress for her wedding and I would still support her. She insisted that she could pay me back and give a certain date that she would give me the money. When that date came around, I reminded her that she said she was pay me that day and she came up with another excuse as to why she couldn’t pay and got upset and just told me to sell the dress. 

     I knew she loved the dress and didn’t want to do that to her and explained that I didn’t want to sell the dress because I knew how much she liked it and would rather her pay me back when she could, but also to let me know if she couldn’t and to be honest and upfront with me. She then again insisted that she would pay me back and gave another date that she would pay me. I even told her that if she couldn’t pay me all of it at once she could pay me it back in increments to make it easier for her. Well that date rolls around and now I’m frustrated, she’s made more excuses as to why she can’t pay me and to just sell the dress and had she known I was just after money then she never would have made me her MOH. 

     Now I’m upset because because now she’s accusing me of only wanting her money when that isn’t true. So I told her Fuc* it, I wanted to be supportive, I never wanted to sell you dress but now I am going to and try to get my money back from it and keep the money. I’m not after your money and I’ve given you plenty of opportunities to tell me that you couldn’t pay for it and I would accept it and cut my losses on it. She says I can’t do that and I have to pay her back $110 that she put into it alone with my brothers ex who put $220 into it (mind you my brothers ex lived at my mom’s house for over a year for free paying absolutely no rent) and that if I don’t sell the dress for $800 she’ll tell people that I’m scamming them. I tired to reason with her and tell her getting $800 out of it was impossible when we only paid $709 for it and that if I got more than what I paid for out of it, I would give her what was left for her to split with my brothers ex but she wouldn’t accept that. I even told her that if she could pay me the $200 she owes me by this Friday, I wouldn’t sell her dress and would give it to her. 

     I really thought me and her were best friend, but it doesn’t appear that way. I also have text to prove everything that has been said here in case anyone wants proof. My family is saying that I’m in the right and that I tried to be fair with her along with being way to lenient, while her family is calling me an a**hole. I’m so confused and genuinely don’t know how to feel about the situation. I never wanted to sell her dress to begin with. All I wanted was her to be honest with me and stay true to her word. So AITA for selling her dress to try and get my money back after she lied to me multiple times telling me she would pay me back?"

At that point I had asked her to just be honest with me and tell me if she wasn’t able to pay me back. I wouldn’t be upset and I would just call it a day and cut my losses. She would have her dress for her wedding and I would still support her. She insisted that she could pay me back and give a certain date that she would give me the money. When that date came around, I reminded her that she said she was pay me that day and she came up with another excuse as to why she couldn’t pay and got upset and just told me to sell the dress. 

     I knew she loved the dress and didn’t want to do that to her and explained that I didn’t want to sell the dress because I knew how much she liked it and would rather her pay me back when she could, but also to let me know if she couldn’t and to be honest and upfront with me. She then again insisted that she would pay me back and gave another date that she would pay me. I even told her that if she couldn’t pay me all of it at once she could pay me it back in increments to make it easier for her. Well that date rolls around and now I’m frustrated, she’s made more excuses as to why she can’t pay me and to just sell the dress and had she known I was just after money then she never would have made me her MOH. 

     Now I’m upset because because now she’s accusing me of only wanting her money when that isn’t true. So I told her Fuc* it, I wanted to be supportive, I never wanted to sell you dress but now I am going to and try to get my money back from it and keep the money. I’m not after your money and I’ve given you plenty of opportunities to tell me that you couldn’t pay for it and I would accept it and cut my losses on it. She says I can’t do that and I have to pay her back $110 that she put into it alone with my brothers ex who put $220 into it (mind you my brothers ex lived at my mom’s house for over a year for free paying absolutely no rent) and that if I don’t sell the dress for $800 she’ll tell people that I’m scamming them. I tired to reason with her and tell her getting $800 out of it was impossible when we only paid $709 for it and that if I got more than what I paid for out of it, I would give her what was left for her to split with my brothers ex but she wouldn’t accept that. I even told her that if she could pay me the $200 she owes me by this Friday, I wouldn’t sell her dress and would give it to her. 

     I really thought me and her were best friend, but it doesn’t appear that way. I also have text to prove everything that has been said here in case anyone wants proof. My family is saying that I’m in the right and that I tried to be fair with her along with being way to lenient, while her family is calling me an a**hole. I’m so confused and genuinely don’t know how to feel about the situation. I never wanted to sell her dress to begin with. All I wanted was her to be honest with me and stay true to her word. So AITA for selling her dress to try and get my money back after she lied to me multiple times telling me she would pay me back?"

My uncle, a vet, told me that those were signs of ADHD and OCD. I googled them and felt like they reflected some of my behaviors. I talked to my mother and she blew up. She told me that I had no issues and was just extremely distracted all the time because of tv programs and that stuff, and that if I got myself checked I would just be drugged with medicines like my grandma. After that I dropped the subject and my uncle never mentioned it again.

My boyfriend always tells me that I‘m really lucky to have parents that are this supportive and he really likes them, but he always talks about how I shouldn’t use it this much, especially with money, or that I’m still to dependant on my parents.) and that there are people that don’t have this kind of support (whether there are kids that don’t have parents, or they’re parents aren’t as good of, etc.)

So am I in the right with saying to my boyfriend that I’m taking advantage of the support my parents are offering me as long they give it to me, and I know that they can afford it? 

Here are a few examples, so that you can understand what he means. 

 If I have time (about two times in a month) I drive to them, and my dad always fills up my tank, so I don’t pay for gas money 

 I want to do my tax with my dad instead with boyfriend, because I never did it before and I want the support of my dad with that 

 I did buy a few (maybe unnecessary items) so I asked my dad if he could put money in my account from the account with money he saved up for me

For context, I am a single mother by choice who adopted a sibling group from foster care about ten years ago. I have two boys (11 and 12) and a daughter, age 9. My 11-year-old son has a mental illness, a mood disorder similar to bipolar disorder, but he has not been diagnosed with that just yet. He has been in and out of mental hospitals (over four months, a one-month stay, a four-month stay, and two one-week stays in the ER mental ward), therapy, individual counseling, family counseling, intense home therapy three times a week for six weeks, He has had a psychiatrist over the last five years. We visited my parents for Christmas, and they witnessed some of his behavior (My mom knows everything, and I tell her almost right after an incident happens, but my dad didn't know what was going on). I also visited with some friends, and they got an updated version of what has been happening.

Since my son was 6, he has been physically abusive to my other two kids and me, but mostly to me. When he has what we call rages, he hits, punches, bites, kicks, etc. I have a mark on my stomach from him clawing into my skin, he has tried to pull the steering wheel while I was driving, tried to jump out of the car while I was driving, and physically assaulted a police officer, which led him to be placed in a straight jacket and taken to the nearest mental hospital. And many other things. More recently, in the last three years, he has run away from home 20+ times, tried to attack us with a knife, threatened to kill us, attacked the family dog by kicking her, broken my glasses, and much more. I bought a taser about two years ago for my protection, and our knives are in a knife container that locks with a code. A month ago, I found out he had stolen my credit card. Four of them. In the middle of the night, he snuck out of his room and wrote down the card numbers. He spent about $1K with my debit card. On the other cards, he only charged a small amount that had to be verified before he could spend more, so he was basically unable to use those cards. 

I have accepted that I am in this until he turns 18 as it does not seem like, with age, things will get better; they will get worse. With each new incident, it takes me at least three weeks to get to a place where I can have basic conversations with him because, after doing this for so many years, it is hard to rebound with each new violent rage. On the other hand, he can rebound from cussing me out, telling me he doesn't want to be a part of this family, and physically assaulting me to wanting a hug the next day. We have had two CPS cases, and the police have been to my house at least 15 times. 

So am I the asshole for ignoring him, only taking care of his basic needs as he is still my child, and basically waiting for him to either get arrested, go live in a group home, or go live with my parents if they offer, or he turns 18?"

Before I even start the story, I want to preface this by saying that this particular time, I know it isn’t their fault. They are sick and I wouldn’t want them to help me move this one time, not only for their health but also to not spread the flu. I’m frustrated by the culmination of all the times they’ve backed out of helping me move. 

Okay, so I am an astrophysics PhD student. Astrophysics is a field that requires students and early career scientists to move A LOT. I think I saw a statistic that astrophysicists live in 6-7 cities on average before finding a permanent position. 

The first time I moved was for my master’s degree. I had asked my mom and grandfather (they live together and my grandfather is a very physical and not at all frail or sick kind of man, I would never ask someone sick to help me) almost a year in advance to help me move and checked in periodically, and they said yes. Two days before the move (from small town Appalachia to big city California) they decided that it was going to be too much for them because they also would have to help my aunt move (much shorter distance) two weeks later and also they wanted to go visit my sister who lived in Florida. So I had to scramble and spend a ton of money to get a uhaul, pack it all up, and drive cross country by myself. That was my first ever move away from my parent’s house. 

When I graduated from my master’s I moved from big city California to the Midwest for my PhD. I asked them again way in advance to help me move. They backed out a little less than a week before(I legitimately don’t even remember the reason, I think my brain just tried to repress it) and I had to do the same thing again. 

I decided to leave school at Midwest school only a few weeks in because I was sexually assaulted and the title IX office refused to help me (much different story and yes I’m taking legal action). To their credit, they did help me leave there and come back home for a few months. 

I was able to get my application re-evaluated at a different school I had been accepted to, and so in two days I will be moving from small Appalachian town to big east coast city to finish my PhD. 

Here’s the AITA part. My mom and grandfather both now have the flu and can’t help me as agreed anymore. We were sitting at the table trying to talk about logistics/alternatives so I can yet again do this by myself. I started crying because I’m exhausted and stressed out, and my mom asked me what was wrong. I just said “I know in this particular instance it isn’t your fault, but this is the fourth time I’ve moved, and the third time you’ve had to back out last minute”. 

Now my mom is extremely mad at me (she and I have been on pretty rocky footing for unrelated reasons recently, so I imagine that’s part of why she’s so mad). 

AITA? It’s not like I’m asking them to still help me while sick, and I just feel like I should be allowed to be frustrated"

zxxbv4_6553,zxxbv4,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,"I (f19) have been dating my bf (m19) for roughly 2.5 yrs now. We broke up about 8 months ago &amp; then got back together after about 2.5 months. We've been doing pretty good &amp; have had a pretty solid relationship up until I got my new job. 

A bit about my job, I work security at a university and work 12hr shifts. I work 4 days, then get 4 days off for 2 weeks then I work 4 nightshifts &amp; get 4 days off for 2 weeks (so its 2 sets of days &amp; 2 sets of nights). This is a new job for me. I did security through another company, but this is a whole different level of security &amp; it is looking like a good career start for me. I make more money than him and I have more days off than he does. He also works security but at a different place &amp; his schedule is 8hr shifts &amp; it is random shift work, so he doesn't work as much. 

I have had a very stressful year and all of my biggest stressors have popped up in such a short amount of time. My only grandfather is dying &amp; it is mentally draining watching him suffer while he is still all there in the head. I moved into my own apartment due to problems living with my parents. I crochet and do farmers markets once a month to save money, so a large chunk of my days are spent crocheting. I have had 4 jobs this year to support myself &amp; overworking myself is a big issue for me. Just as I moved out of my house, I am moving back home as I have been better with my parents &amp; I am looking to buy my own house in spring so they're allowing me to stay at home so I don't have to start a new lease. On top of all of that I don't sleep well at night. I never really have, but it has gotten worse since I got my new job. I average 3-5hrs of sleep on my work nights because I find it difficult rearranging my sleep schedule every 2 weeks &amp; I am just not adjusted to it yet. I just don't really get a break from life, even on my days off; something always pops up

So now to the problem with my bf. He lives at home rent free &amp; doesn't want to move out until he has his police career set in stone. I respect that, but I am at a different point in my life. He says he understands my stress but he doesn't. He's never been through the types of stress that I'm going through and he doesn't understand how exhausting it really is to do all of this stuff on your own. Before I am called out for ""not doing any of this stuff with him or a roommate"" please understand that he has no interest in moving out right now &amp; I tried to get a roommate but was unsuccessful. Anyways, on my work days he constantly asks me to hang out when I'm done work, but I tell him no as  I am too tired. On my days off I try to see him 1 out of 4 of the days, but he usually is working or I am tired or busy with my grandparents or other family. He has recently begun to guilt trip me &amp; tell me that I shouldn't be so tired or that I shouldn't be so distant, but I am just so tired. On night shifts, especially, I go home, have a shower, eat a bit, and go right to sleep to try and get an ok sleep for my next 12hr shift. It has been a hard year for me &amp; he knows that but he still continues to make me feel guilty &amp; he constantly makes me feel bad when I tell him no to hanging out.

Another problem I have with him is his family. He comes from divorced parents that treat him as if he is still 10. His whole family treats him as if he were a child. They also don't like me on both sides of his family, especially his moms side. He has told my mom that his moms side of the family hates me. I think that when we had first broke up, he had went around to his family telling them every little flaw of mine &amp; that set them off. I also think they hate me because we broke up &amp; got back together, &amp; they can't get past it. It really bothers me, especially with Christmas, his family didn't want me at any of his Christmases. This all comes from the fact that they treat him like a child and can't seem to accept that he is an adult that makes adult choices and adult mistakes. I've repeatedly told him to stand up for me (which I shouldn't have to) but he never does it. His mom (only person ok with me) offered to talk to her side of the family for me, but I told her I wanted it to come from him as I am his gf &amp; that he needs to do this for me. He still has yet to do it after 7.5 months of being back together &amp; I am losing hope that he'll ever do it. Those issues are also mentally draining to me because he's a family man &amp; it gives me more anxiety being around his family &amp; it makes it so I have to watch every little thing I do with him because I'm scared of what he'll tell his family to make them hate me more.

We're currently on a relationship break (that I demanded) &amp; I really don't feel like going back to him. Although he has been loving to me &amp; overall, he's a pretty good guy &amp; I do love him, but I am just so tired &amp; he doesn't even care to help or to back off a bit so I can take a breath &amp; take a break from life for a moment &amp; just have a good sleep for once. 

so am I the asshole here?"

He has recently begun to guilt trip me &amp; tell me that I shouldn't be so tired or that I shouldn't be so distant, but I am just so tired. On night shifts, especially, I go home, have a shower, eat a bit, and go right to sleep to try and get an ok sleep for my next 12hr shift. It has been a hard year for me &amp; he knows that but he still continues to make me feel guilty &amp; he constantly makes me feel bad when I tell him no to hanging out.

Another problem I have with him is his family. He comes from divorced parents that treat him as if he is still 10. His whole family treats him as if he were a child. They also don't like me on both sides of his family, especially his moms side. He has told my mom that his moms side of the family hates me. I think that when we had first broke up, he had went around to his family telling them every little flaw of mine &amp; that set them off. I also think they hate me because we broke up &amp; got back together, &amp; they can't get past it. It really bothers me, especially with Christmas, his family didn't want me at any of his Christmases. This all comes from the fact that they treat him like a child and can't seem to accept that he is an adult that makes adult choices and adult mistakes. I've repeatedly told him to stand up for me (which I shouldn't have to) but he never does it. His mom (only person ok with me) offered to talk to her side of the family for me, but I told her I wanted it to come from him as I am his gf &amp; that he needs to do this for me. He still has yet to do it after 7.5 months of being back together &amp; I am losing hope that he'll ever do it. Those issues are also mentally draining to me because he's a family man &amp; it gives me more anxiety being around his family &amp; it makes it so I have to watch every little thing I do with him because I'm scared of what he'll tell his family to make them hate me more.

We're currently on a relationship break (that I demanded) &amp; I really don't feel like going back to him. Although he has been loving to me &amp; overall, he's a pretty good guy &amp; I do love him, but I am just so tired &amp; he doesn't even care to help or to back off a bit so I can take a breath &amp; take a break from life for a moment &amp; just have a good sleep for once. 

so am I the asshole here?"
zy1m6p_6560,zy1m6p,op-engaged,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"I 24 f and my so 21 m had a baby in august of 2021. I had a miserable pregnancy (not because of anything in specific, I just hated being pregnant) and after I had my son I had a bunch of medical problems with my heart and fluid in my lungs that caused me to be in the hospital for a week after having my son. I felt really guilty about it since I was away from him.  As a result of said problem I had to wear a portable defibrillator and had to be careful who I was around. (Around the time of Covid) about a month later my fil had gotten sick too and was in the hospital for about a month and a half with Covid and pneumonia. After I got out I made sure to tell people do not kiss my child, get in his face or suck his binky clean and to let us know when anyone was sick so my condition ( which is lifelong) wouldn’t be worsened or jeopardized andi didn’t have to deal with a newborn with Covid. We got no warning of anyone being sick until we got to their house but when he got sick they asked us to be considerate and not come around until we were clear. Move on to the times we would go over, I would catch my so’s sister kissing my son after I asked them not to. So we kept reminding them. Then my so’s birthday came shortly after I gave birth. I told his siblings if anyone wanted to hold him to ask me first. My son was asleep in my arms and his sister offered to put him in his bouncer to sleep. I said sure just to make sure to ask me if anyone wants to hold him. I walk in to someone I had only met once before holding my child and I stopped in my tracks and stared and she put him down. Later on his mom was holding him and let someone I didn’t know hold him and kiss him. I was livid. So I kept him close the rest of the night. Fast forward to a few months later ( somethings might have happened in between too much to type) and his little brother is holding him but his sister wanted him and he said no so she punch the brother with my son in his arms still. A week later the same thing happens and I say something and yell at them. All during this time she’s sneaking kisses after I’ve asked not to. One night we decide to go out for a date night and ask his mom to watch the baby. The whole time we’re out she’s texting asking when we’re going to be back to get him and when we get back she’s asleep and the 15 year old sister is watching him. (I don’t trust her to know what to do in an emergency so i would rather have an adult always watching him) Again livid. Then a few months later we ask his mom to watch him again. We get back and his sister tells us that she gave our 6/7 month old baby a sour patch kid and that she’s been watching him for the last hour. I’m over his family at this point. Fast forward to his first birthday party, me and his dad were having a rough time. I forced him to move in with his mom for a while and my son would go over on weekends. In between him living with his mom he would come over during weekdays sometimes to have dinner with us and his mom would make snarky comments like oh careful she might put poison in your food but he says it was a joke. His birthday party came and they made my family and I feel soo unwelcome. I got there to decorate and they didn’t help with anything. ( It was at their house) setting up chairs, tables, decorations, food etc. I don’t get a hi upon my arrival, don’t get help decorating, and when my family started to arrive it only got worse. My so and I set up everything outside while they stayed inside glaring at my family from the back door. Every five minutes someone was in the door. His mom invited people i barely knew and I didn’t invite, and when all her guests that she invited arrived they stayed inside the house the ENTIRE TIME. They even set up tables and chairs inside but couldn’t help us do it outside. It started to rain and none of his family said we could come inside, so we’re all huddled on this small porch while winds and rain were blowing everywhere. Their first thought was to bring the food in. So we sang happy birthday and opened presents and all of my family left. About an hour later they asked if we were going to sing happy birthday and my sons father told his mom and sister we already did. I guess they were shocked and asked “you really did it already without us”. Yes we did. You have not participated at all. This was my last straw. I told my sons father he would no be going over there until they learned to respect me as his mother. (We are back together now so he lives with me) he agreed but I feel a little guilty about it soo Aita?"

I was carrying bags in both of my hands so i didn't zip my jacket and my mom was in a bad mood and when she is, she gets mad really easily and is always rude. She told me to zip my jacket, i didn't respond because my hands were full of bags and we were close to our building, she told me again, i sighed, put the bags down and started zipping my jacket. I told her that her jacket isn't zipped either, she replied that she has a scarf, then i complained how she was the one who told me not to wear a scarf, then she pulled my hair and told me to stop talking back. I picked up my bags while my father took his keys to open the door to the place we're staying at. When we got inside i went to the bathroom with tears in my eyes and she saw me, she said how this always ends in tears and then i told her the reason i cried was bc it reminded me of when i was a kid (i used to get hit and my hair would get pulled sometimes as discipline, it didn't happen that much but still occasionally it would) She then told me that the world doesn't revolve around me and that my childhood wasn't even that bad, and it's good that she hit me bc otherwise i would turn out undisciplined, she accused me of guilt tripping her. My dad came to talk with me and i calmly told him that i didn't zip my jacket bc my hands were full of bags. I realized here that i answer calmly when the other person is also calm with me, also with my mom but she was rude at that time so i wasn't very nice either. I'm wondering rn if i actually guilt tripped her unintentionally and i'm overly sensitive and hitting your children isn't that bad or I'm being gaslighted.

Edit: TYSM TO EVERYONE GIVING ME ADVICE TO CALL HER OUT ON THIS BUT- you need to understand that I can't do that otherwise she'd guilt trip me like always, and guilt is my main weakness. I'd rather just live like this and deal with it till i'm 18 than making more conflict. Hitting your children and pulling hair is very normalized in my family because i grew up in a Serbia and hitting your children is very normalized there. When i tell my mom anything about the times she hit me as discipline and how it's bad she'd compare it to more severe types of abuse to make me believe what she did wasn't that bad. I think she's gaslighting me into thinking she didn't do it a lot but i remember many times when she did it- though i forgot a lot so i'm not sure."

zy828l_6574,zy828l,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"So this one’s complicated. My (26F) ex(26M) of 5 years left me two years ago after having an ongoing affair with a married woman(28F) who was both of our’s friend. I was suspicious about it for a while and when I really started to question it, they announced on the same day that he was leaving for me and she was filing for divorce. They have- to this day- denied that they were having an affair and it all “just happened” after the two mutually exclusive events. (They were dating and living together two weeks later) There was months of a mess that came out of the whole thing, but eventually I ended up moving out of state to live with one of my best friends(24M) and get away from all of it. We have since started a great life together, gotten married and are currently expecting our first child in a few months. (He’s an angel) 

In the two years since, I have come to learn that my ex had been lying to me and cheating on me for pretty much the entire 5 years of our relationship. We share many of of the same friends and since I was no longer his gf, they had no reason not to share any secrets or suspicions they may have had of their own about him. Some of the information I’ve learned is that since he’s been with his new gf is that he has ALSO been cheating on her. A lot. With many of the same women he did to me. And he’s tried to leave her multiple times (she always guilts him into staying) and treats her like absolute trash most of the time (he’s a textbook narcissist). He also tried to keep in contact with me for about the first year after we broke up, even after I moved 900 miles away. I cut off contact with him numerous times. Blocked him on all socials. I actually deleted many of my socials just out of not being able to handle seeing a lot of things (since they still popped up as we share so many mutual friends). I eventually joined Twitter because it’s the one social that no one in our hometown really uses. Once he realized I had cut him off it took a while but he eventually found my Twitter and began to use that as a way to try and communicate with me as well. In the past year he’s made 3 separate accounts (because I keep blocking them) for the sole purpose of following me (all of which no one, including the new gf know about-except my husband ofc). I have physical evidence of his two secret Snapchat accounts (probably for his side girls). 

Despite the fact that I have animosity towards his new gf for her part in our breakup, I’ve always been a “women support women” kind of girl and have felt that even though what she did was awful, she doesn’t deserve what he’s doing to her now as well. But I’ve never told her. I know a few months ago a few people tried to tell her he was cheating and she refused to believe it. So I’ve always assumed that there’s no way she would believe ME of all people if I told her the truth as well, despite the actual physical evidence I have to the contrary. She would probably freak out and call me petty and say that I’m only saying that out of my own resentment and am just the “crazy ex”. And I won’t lie, a small part of me also said “well karma’s a b***h”. Even though I literally moved 900 miles away, let them have their relationship and have since gotten married and started a much better life of my own. 

But now, it turns out that they are ALSO currently expecting a child together soon. I’ve already always felt some guilt about the whole thing despite everything and now I’m beginning to wonder if I’m TA for not telling her and at least letting her have the information to do with as she so chose. If maybe she deserved to know the truth about the man she’s now going to be spending the rest of her life attached to and raising a child together with BEFORE it had happened. Because he hasn’t changed. And probably never will. And even despite what she did, NO woman deserves what he has done and continues to do. I know first hand what that kind of betrayal and lies feels like. And while I also don’t believe people should stick their noses in others business I know I WISH our friends or someone would have told me about those things when I was in that situation vs letting me continue to spend yearssss in a toxic situation. So AITA for not telling her???

Note to add: this is something I haven’t really been too concerned about for a long time. I was able to move on and let it be and continue my happy life with my wonderful husband and our very healthy relationship without thinking about it. But my husband and I recently moved back home to be close to family. And since we all still share a lot of mutual friends, we’ve been around each other a bit (kids birthdays, friend’s holiday parties, etc and it goes well and civilly) but a lot of it has since come back up recently especially with the announcement of their coming child. So it’s been a little fresh again and has had me wondering."

I’m 23F. I have a 4-year-old son, and for the past 6 months I’ve been seeing a man who I will call Chris (38M). About a year ago, I broke up with Matt (26M). I left my son’s father on very bad terms when I was pregnant, and was single for the next couple years while I got my proverbial shit in a pile. Matt was the first guy I ever dated since breaking up with my son’s father, and we went out for a little under a year and a half. While we dated, he forged a very close bond with my son, and they still spend time together. We broke up for good, though, because he got a girl in his masters program pregnant. This was devastating to me, but because he had a wonderful relationship with my son,  I didn’t want my son’s relationship with his only real father figure to just end overnight, so he still spends some time with Matt. I want to be an adult about this situation.  Matt wants my son to pop by this weekend so he can give him his Christmas present. 

Enter Chris. Chris has been dating me for 6 months now and I’m thinking about introducing him to my son, as I have a “6 month minimum.” Chris wanted to do it this weekend and, in a conversation about scheduling, I mentioned that my son would briefly stop by at my ex’s to get his present and see the baby. Chris was offended by this, because he said it indicated I was still emotionally enmeshed with my ex (I am not really on great terms with Matt right now, but try to put that aside). He said this was disrespectful to him and would teach my son “horrible lessons about women.”

zygprk_6594,zygprk,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"Throwaway account because my partner knows my Reddit.

TLDR at bottom.

I (29F) have been with my partner (37M) for over 3.5 years (almost all of which we have lived together. He has two kids (8 and 10), which I am very involved with. This Xmas due to my partner being sick and working a bunch, I literally did everything for Xmas. All of it. I bought all of the presents, I got the stuff to fill the stockings, I wrapped everything, got the food, cleaned the house, etc. I also work full time and was also sick (albeit less sick), so it’s not like it wasn’t a ton of time and effort for me. I made sure to try and find stuff that each person would specifically like or they needed and it did take a while. I regularly put in a ton of effort for him and his kids though, this isn’t just a Xmas thing. It’s also relevant for me to add that his birthday is the day after Xmas, so I also put in a ton of effort to make that special for him too.

Here comes the title part. Before Xmas, he asked me multiple times what I wanted. I sent him a list, complete even with links to buy stuff or stores to find each item at. It had a range of price points between tiny stocking stuffers (&lt;$10) to the most expensive thing being about $100. I even included gift card options in case he felt stuck. 

On Xmas eve, he told me he had no stocking stuffers for me yet and we had to go to the mall. Yes, I went with him. He had me pick out two items (one of which he insisted had to be a candle even though I said I have a lot of candles) and then told me he was done and we left. Felt shitty and it didn’t really seem like he actually cared what I wanted or would have liked. 

Then on Xmas morning, we open stockings. It’s the two things I helped pick for myself… and a charger that I BOUGHT MYSELF. He literally put it in my stocking and I couldn’t say shit because I don’t want to ruin Santa for the kids (yes, that’s a whole other thing at age 10, but not my place so whatever). When I opened my gifts from him, he got me carhartt work pants, a carhartt tshirt, work socks, and an oversized carhartt hoodie. 

For context, I am VERY interested in fashion, and dress very fashion forward. I like makeup, and generally if I’m not wearing something trendy, I’m wearing lululemon style athletic wear. So this is 1000% not me at all whatsoever. However, I also work in oil and gas and very much so already have PLENTY of appropriate work clothing if needed, including full coveralls. I was super disappointed when he informed me that “it was so that I can wear it to help him with projects”. I told him that I already have plenty of work clothes, including pants like that, and he said to show him, so I did. A whole big pile of work clothes. He still wanted me to try on the new stuff, so I did try on the stuff and technically it fits, but it’s so ugly and cut terribly, not to mention the fabric is not comfortable and it’s just simply not something I would ever wear. 

I asked if he would be offended if I returned it, and now he keeps insisting that I’ll wear it. I keep telling him I’m not comfortable in it, i already have lots of work clothes, I won’t reasonably wear it, and that it cost a LOT of money for something that won’t get worn. He’s gotten me gifts in the past that I didn’t like, but with them being cheaper, I’ve never said anything and just acted appreciative. But with the pants and hoodie each being over $100, it’s just too much money for it to sit there. Plus, I honestly feel hurt that after I put in so much effort for him and his kids, that he didn’t even put in the smallest amount of effort to get something that I might actually like, or that would make me feel special or appreciated, especially when he had a list of ideas to work from with much lower prices ranges (so it’s very much so not about the price). I would be lying if I said I didn’t have a good cry in the shower on Christmas before going to bed solely because I felt sad and unappreciated (for some other reasons too but trying I keep this post more specific to the gifts).

I feel like a brat for not appreciating my gifts, but I also don’t really feel like he put any care into my gifts and he got me something that he thought would ultimately benefit him. So AITAH?

TLDR: My partner put no effort into trying to get me anything I like, despite even having a list of cheaper things. He got me super expensive clothes that are ugly and not at all something I would ever wear. I feel sad and want to return them.

I returned the stuff. He’s okay. Thanks y’all ❤️"

TLDR at bottom.

I (29F) have been with my partner (37M) for over 3.5 years (almost all of which we have lived together. He has two kids (8 and 10), which I am very involved with. This Xmas due to my partner being sick and working a bunch, I literally did everything for Xmas. All of it. I bought all of the presents, I got the stuff to fill the stockings, I wrapped everything, got the food, cleaned the house, etc. I also work full time and was also sick (albeit less sick), so it’s not like it wasn’t a ton of time and effort for me. I made sure to try and find stuff that each person would specifically like or they needed and it did take a while. I regularly put in a ton of effort for him and his kids though, this isn’t just a Xmas thing. It’s also relevant for me to add that his birthday is the day after Xmas, so I also put in a ton of effort to make that special for him too.

Here comes the title part. Before Xmas, he asked me multiple times what I wanted. I sent him a list, complete even with links to buy stuff or stores to find each item at. It had a range of price points between tiny stocking stuffers (&lt;$10) to the most expensive thing being about $100. I even included gift card options in case he felt stuck. 

On Xmas eve, he told me he had no stocking stuffers for me yet and we had to go to the mall. Yes, I went with him. He had me pick out two items (one of which he insisted had to be a candle even though I said I have a lot of candles) and then told me he was done and we left. Felt shitty and it didn’t really seem like he actually cared what I wanted or would have liked.

zyh2ko_6602,zyh2ko,top-comment,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I 26F and my boyfriend 32 M, have been together for over two years. He had a female friend called Danielle since they were at University but I had no idea about her. When we had just started our relationship I asked him if he had any females friends and he said no. However, 1 year into the relationship I found out that this woman was his gym partner and he would work out with her without telling me. I did not argue with him, I just told him I wished he was honest with me about having a female friend, He said that they only work out together and they don't talk outside of that. A couple of months after that he left his phone at home and I was answering his calls and messages as he instructed me and I saw that they called each other at least once a week as per his call logs, I was upset that he lied about that fact but even though I had his phone I chose not to search their messages. When he got home I asked him about it and he said she called to ask about them starting to work out together again. They had stopped working out together because he started taking me to the gym. I then found out that she lives 1 hour from us and she has a gym 15 minutes from her house and we have one 15 minutes from our house so that means one of them drove 1 hour from home to work out with the other, I started to get suspicious so I asked him about her again and he said that they aren't close friends. I ask to see their messages to confirm, but when I opened their messages he deleted all their conversations from when he and I got into a relationship. I then told him that all of this is suspicious behaviour, he even admits that if I had done all of what he has done he would find it suspicious. He never blocked her citing that he doesn't want to lose a close friend, we argued about this for months until he blocked her on Instagram but not her number, he only deleted it. I cried for weeks begging him to choose me, but even if he blocks her on everything I can't trust that, because when it pertains to her, he lies.  This is driving me crazy. Now I just feel as if I'm not worth anything to him.

UPDATE... About me asking if he had any females friends, I only put that part in to show that he lied from the start. I asked him about females friends just like he asked me about my male friends. I also asked him about his male friends and who his best friend was and so forth. We asked each other questions about who was in our lives to get to know each other better. I thought that was normal, I never asked about a females friend only,  I asked about all his friends as he did with me. Also, he has other females friends that I have met and have no issue with, I am not telling him to cut them off just this one. Also to those asking this particular friend does not know he is in a relationship. For those saying I could be the side chick, it is possible, I do live with him and his family but I still go home to my parents for the Weekends, so who knows? But I am not sure what is so confusing about my post that some people are saying I shouldn't ask him to cut off all his female friends when I am asking about ONE specific friend not all of them. I honestly thought my post was clear. Thanks for all the advice guys. "

zyt4dx_6614,zyt4dx,op-engaged,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,"I (24F) have been watching my (28F) sister's kids since they were born. Her kids are now 5 &amp; 7 years old, and over this past year, their behavior has gotten pretty awful. My sister is a single mother and her baby daddy (33M) is not in the picture. He has a family history of mental illness, ADHD, and Autism. 

My nieces have both been suspended from school on multiple occasions for being violent, aggressive, and destroying property. They go to a counselor and have plans at school, but that doesn't help the behavior at home. My sister has always relied on me and the family to be (free) childcare. I have never required her to pay me, but have asked for cash here and there to help pay for gas (I live 25 miles away). When my nieces were getting suspended from school, I was the one that ended up having to drop my plans to watch them. As everyone else in the family is busy and cannot help with childcare, I have unknowingly become the sole childcare provider.

My sister lit into me last night because I did not spank the girls for misbehaving. I do not feel comfortable with giving the kids physical punishments like spankings, as I am not their parent. I have explained this to my sister many times, but she still thinks that it is stupid of me not to do it, and has not respected that boundary. I stretched WAY too thin with my stuff and I cannot continue to sacrifice my plans and future for her and her kids. I love my family and I am trying the best that I can to work with her, but my sister always has something to critique about me and it genuinely feels like I can never do anything right when it comes to her and her kids. 

I am to the point where I need to make a choice. I spoke with my mother about this at length, and she is trying to remain a neutral party in it but says I need to grow up and stand up for myself because she is sick of both my sister and I not being able to get along. I have been thinking of having this conversation for a while, but have not done it yet due to my anxiety. I feel that, for my health and well-being, I need to step away and focus on ME. I know that my sister will be angry about this, and will guilt trip me and potentially even vilify my character to our friends and family until she gets what she wants. So here I am.

WIBTA if I tell my sister that I cannot continue to watch her kids for my mental health?

EDIT: Hi, I have seen some comments on here about finding a job. I DID have a full-time job, but was recently let go/fired due to having negative PTO hours.. doctor's appointments, COVID-19, and being ""emergency"" childcare all ate up my PTO (I'm not bitter at all. Well, maybe I am.) But that being said, I am currently looking for a remote/work from home position so that I do not have to worry about commuting while I recover from my shoulder surgery. I've been doing DoorDash and donating plasma to make ends meet, and I really want to go back to school. But hey, thank you for your interest and for the advice and encouragement in the comments. I have never felt so valid in my life. I'm going to tell her soon."

YES, IM THE ASSHOLE. I’ve realised it, and I’m tired so I’m kind of done with this. Have fun calling me the asshole if you want to, but like… I already know so what’s the point

I’m staying at my girlfriends apartment for new years and I’ve brought my dogs (both Malamutes, and rather large for their breed) with me. She’s fine with this, but she’s very strict about not letting the dogs on the couch. I get it, they’re big dogs, and they moult a lot even in the winter, so there’s a chance they could get hair all over her couch or even break it, so I’ve obeyed the rule as much as I can and have even sat on the floor for long periods of time so that my dogs, if they needed me, wouldn’t try to get up on her couch.. However, they’re both really old for their breed, and both suffer from some joint issues.

Because of this, my eldest dog has issues with standing up and she can often cause a bit of a mess when trying to do so as it puts too much pressure on her bladder. It’s gotten bad the past couple of days, and so my girlfriend took her to the vet whilst I had to stay at the apartment with the younger dog, as he’s much larger and can act up when my other dog is not there, so he needed someone to stay with him and be able to comfort him in her absence.

However, he’s a very old dog, and can get very nervous, so whilst I was sat on the couch, he climbed up next to me (with much struggle, and I tried to discourage it) and laid down. I tried to get him off, but it’s hard enough for him to get up on the couch with his joints, and getting down is only harder for him and he’s too heavy to pick up without injuring him or myself, so I let him lay on the couch with me for a while until my other dog returned. He seemed to really calm down whilst he was laid with me, so I thought that it would have been worth it regardless.

The couch is fine, and I had a blanket down on the couch so no hair got on the couch itself, and the blanket would just need a little lint rolling, but my girlfriend is telling me I shouldn’t have done it. I understand that it is her apartment, and that I’m only a visitor, that breaking the rules of her apartment was disrespectful and stuff, but I’m not going to apologise for anything beyond hurting her feelings because… my dog needed comfort, and he’s old as shit, I wasn’t going to risk hurting him or myself just because he wanted to cuddle.

So am I the asshole?"

Growing up, I (now 22, non-binary) wasn’t very well treated by my parents. I’d rather not go into details, but it was… harsh. It developed from being physical to being more of a power play as I got older, especially when I moved to college. They’d heavily surveil me, get notified every time I left college, and they broke my phone and left me with no money to buy a new one, and wouldn’t allow me to work a job, and would often send emails to anywhere I interviewed to so they would have to deny me. It was… a lot. Eventually I caved and started asking them for things like money for food and a new phone, but they had their own way of making sure I was limited to doing only what they wanted me to.

Regardless, I managed to cut them off completely when I dropped out, and whilst I’m broke as shit, I’m finally at a place where I’m happy in my life. My girlfriend, J (22f), didn’t know much about this. She knew I had a rough childhood, that I cut them off and I had warned her not to answer phone calls from unknown numbers and such just incase, but she didn’t know any of the details until today.

We were talking with mutual friends that i’d known since highschool, and they mentioned they’d seen my sister. J started asking loads of questions, which basically, once she got answers, resulted in a ‘I could never do that’ comment. I asked what she meant and she told me that she could never abandon her siblings in a situation like that. I explained that there was nothing I could do to help, and if I didn’t escape when I did, I wouldn’t have escaped at all. She keeps calling me an asshole and saying I’m selfish, because if she was in that situation and one of her siblings do that, she’d be hurt, but I’m still sort of sticking by my side, but I’m not sure if I should be.

Am I the asshole?"

There’s this teacher in particular, who we’ll call Ms. Ava (not her real name),  that always calls me by my sisters name. I would normally just assume it was an accident and correct her but the school year is almost over and she hasn’t even bothered to learn my name and acts annoyed when I correct her. Yesterday, she called me by my sisters name AGAIN, and at this point I really think she’s doing it just to bother me. So I raised my had and said “Ms. Ava do you have any sisters?” she told me she did have one so I asked “What is her name?” “Mary” She responded . The next 10 minutes of class went on until I had a question, “Ms. Mary I don’t understand can you help me?” I said. She was furious. She started telling me how disrespectful it was to purposely call her another name just for the sake of being petty, she then told me that I would have 10 points subtracted from my homework for calling her Mary. I told her it wasn’t fair how she always called me my sister’s name on purpose but now that I do it I get punished. She told me that it was different because she was older than me and that if I didn’t stop talking back she would send me to the principals office. I told my mom about it and she said that I was being disrespectful and that I should apologize, but I don’t think I should. So AITA?"
zzd6z2_6652,zzd6z2,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"This Christmas my mother decided to surprise me (21M) with new AirPods Pro’s. I was surprised and extremely grateful as my current AirPods are the original first generation and in need of a replacement.

I thought nothing of them being fake when I first got them, the packing and box looked extremely legit so when I took them to my room to charge them up to use I was surprised by a few things. Firstly, the charging case wouldn’t charge with the wire provided and then the actual AirPods wouldn’t charge without being connected to the wire and lastly when I finally got them charge the battery dried extremely fast and they made an odd buzzing noise that made them uncomfortable to use. 

This surprised me as I’ve bought apple products since I was 13 and never had a problem with them out the box.

At first I just considered it bad luck and laugh it off as of course I’d get faulty AirPods and asked my mother for the receipt so I could take them to the Apple. However, when I told my mother about the problems she told me she couldn’t find the receipt which should’ve been my first hint.

So, I decided to take them to the Apple store regardless and was ready to pay to get them replaced or repaired as I was excited to have them. However, once I arrived and got an appointment I was told that they where in fact a fake pair of AirPods and was shown a few things that differed from the real AirPods Pro’s.

I got home and told my mother this to which she admitted she bought them off some family friend who ensured her they where real. I told her she should definitely get her money back from this friend as I had no use for them as they couldn’t stay charged and wouldn’t charge without being plugged into a wire which is inconvenient to carry around.

To this my mother called me ungrateful, said that I should be happy she bought them for me. I explained that I was happy but that she got scammed and that due to their current condition I wouldn’t get much use as I mostly used my AirPods at the gym or in university where I don’t have access to a socket most of the time to charge them up after each use. 

She once again called me ungrateful and selfish and that I should be happy I got a gift like that even though they don’t work properly.

I am grateful she got me a gift like that but I assumed she’d even be angry at the fact she got scammed and paid a lot of money for something that doesn’t work properly"

Me (22) and my husband (22) have adopted our 2-year-old nephew who we've had since 3 weeks old. My sister (20) lost custody drug use and drinking since age 13 through her pregnancy as well as many illegal activities and neglecting him in the 3 weeks she had him. She has also had narcissistic tendencies and life-altering blow-ups and aggressive tendencies. I lost my entire childhood being neglected for her needs and being parentified by my family to take care of her and be the ""kid no one has to worry about"". We have amicably done visitation and she currently has a 4 mo shes started to clean up her drugs and drinking for, she still drinks and smokes weed but much more reasonably so compared to previous activities and hard drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was her wedding day to her second baby daddy, into a very unhealthy relationship with her current baby daddy, we all voiced our concerns and when she told us it didn't matter we stepped aside and have done nothing but fully supported her and helped her plan and set up this wedding wishing her the best. Me and my husband are foster parents and currently also have 2, 15 yo, teens, absolutely amazing girls. My sister clarified many times that the only dress code was semi-formal/casual, and the only request was that people outside of the wedding party not wear purple or white. Me and the girls spent all day getting dressed to do make-up and hair and pick clothes and get the toddler ready and cute as well. I wore a purple dress as she made me maid of honor (without telling me or asking me, I figured it out when she asked me to get a purple dress and then she told us about the dress code). One girl wore jeans and a button-up shirt, the second girl wore jeans and a laced bodice, the bodice covered above her breast and to her belly button, it was laced with a nude complete cover underneath the lace, she was also wearing a zip-up sweater around it.

I had gotten there early to set up and help and she addressed me in front of all the people to tell me that she needed me to tell my daughter to cover up or change as there was one older person coming and she was worried they might have a problem with it. I told her that I respect that she wanted to ask but I would not tell my child to do that as she was completely covered and just very pretty in her outfit. These kids have huge trauma and self-confidence issues and I would not reinforce that as there was nothing wrong with her outfit and I approved it before we left the house. She became agitated and started telling everyone that my slut of a daughter had the audacity to walk around like that. I asked her, very calmly as I've gotten good at not feeding into her mood or drama, to not talk about my children like that and that we would be happy to leave if it was a problem or made her uncomfortable. She began to scream following me into different rooms and into the main area. My children had come to see what the commotion was and she turned to them and told her that she wasn't going to be allowed to be a slut and a harlot and ruin her day. Mind you my children have not even known that there was a problem until this and even offered to change but she began to scream and cuss and become more aggressive.

I told the kids that, alright it was time to go, as I've seen this play out dozens of times and nothing short of on your hands and knees begging for forgiveness would de-escalate this situation so i chose to remove ourselves and not engage as it was inexcusable to treat my children like this and i was worried that she would become more agitated and worse. She tried to take my son saying, ""you better leave my son here then"" i just very calmly picked him up as the girls started to walk out the door and told her ""its not your son and i will not leave him here without me"". I admit it was a mean comment but i would not further her delusion that it is her, and hers only son as we have up until that point been overly considerate and conscious of doing things like ""say hi to mama \[sister\]"" and so forth and to always try to include her whether she chose to or not while gently making it clear where needed that we are his parents.

My family proceeded to tell me over text, for the millionth time in my life, that they are disgusted by my behavior and how dare i treat her like this and i know how she is why couldn't I just do what she wanted, and then comments that further reinforce a gross mentality about my 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. I blocked my sister and told my family that if they feel it appropriate to talk about a child like that and to continue to justify a grown adult treating a child like that no matter the occasion that i would reassess their access to my children as well. I would swear on my life that i did not say anything to her outside of what i listed above despite her having many additional and derogatory things to say about me and my children throughout this ordeal. I kept nothing but a neutral and calm demeanor and i say this with confidence as its taken a lot of self-work to get to a place to be able to do that and I'm proud of keeping my cool and not feeding the emotional fire. AITA?"

One of such reasons is his parents. They weren’t great at raising him, to put it into kind terms, and so it became a general rule that they’d have nothing to do with our kid, and if we ever needed support, that we’d go to my parents to get it. 

I’m currently dating someone else, 22f, and it’s been a long enough lasting relationship that she’s met my son and everything but she always gets weird at the mention of my exes parents. I’d understand it if it were because she doesn’t like me talking about her ex, but that’s not it. She’s friends with him (albeit not very closely) and, from what I can gather, is completely fine whenever he comes up in conversation. It’s the grandparents that get to her.

I asked her about it, and she told me that, honestly, she just doesn’t understand how I’m able to, not only deprive people of their grandchild, but also deprive my child of his grandparents. She said that he needs the extra support from them, no matter how they acted when my ex was growing up, and mostly just things like that. I guess I understand that point, from an outside perspective, but I’m never going to get rid of that rule, it’s not my rule to get rid of. If my ex eventually feels willing to let his parents meet his son, then sure, the rule is gone, but I’m not breaking that trust simply because it makes my girlfriend upset to think that my child is being ‘deprived’"
