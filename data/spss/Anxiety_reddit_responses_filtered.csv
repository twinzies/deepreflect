So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid."

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep.

To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other.

Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again."

It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this!

About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?"

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ "

Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down. Sorry for the rant, and thanks for your time if you did choose to read through this, I hope you all lead long, fulfilling lifes.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

I just assumed that came with being an adult. Yet here I am, still feeling like I’m at the bottom of the food chain in social situations, and still just as anxious and doubtful of myself as I was 10 years ago.
It’s so weird. On paper I’ve achieved so many of the things I had hoped for myself... I should feel good about myself by now, or at least have enough evidence that I’m not a total piece of shit. 

Childhood me would be saying “how can you still not believe in yourself? How can you STILL be living so fearfully?” 
At this point I honestly don’t know what it will take to prove to myself that I am a perfectly capable human being. Anxiety wins every time.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your responses!!! I resonate with so many of you and it’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this!! I started CBT a few weeks ago and can’t say it’s been particularly helpful so far, but I plan to stick it out and hope for the best. "

EDIT: Ha, this blew up, how poetic. The joy or validation I feel from the upvotes doesn’t match the negativity I would have felt if it went unnoticed, which is good to know! You all are wonderful and this is a great community. I’ve come a long way with my anxiety and I’m working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me, so I hope to see you all here again. ❤️❤️❤️"
a0k03f_621,a0k03f,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!"

My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share. "

Narcissism is “excessive interest in or admiration of oneself and one’s physical appearance”. Google it. Worrying everyone dislikes you or any other thought that involves other people’s opinions about you is not the same as narcissism.

No one with anxiety thinks they’re the best thing since sliced bread.

People with anxiety might be very self-conscious however, and often are aware that these anxious thoughts they’re having aren’t rational. Also, there are lots of people with GAD that don’t have social anxiety. 

Saying these things to people with anxiety only makes things worse and make them doubt themselves even more, so please don’t. "

acpyz0_793,acpyz0,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone! "
acpyz0_795,acpyz0,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part?

In university, I avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. At the time, I didn't realize I had anxiety. But now, when I look back, knowing that I had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that I missed out on socializing and parties. Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not. It's sort of feeling like I wish I could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if I had had the opportunity to socialize more."

Like I’ve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I’m almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people! And though I’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way I do- I feel a bit more fortified that I’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. Let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! 

We got this!"

1. Receive text/email. Feel some anxiety over what to say back so I put it off.
2. Put it off long enough that I feel that too much time has passed for me to answer without it being weird.
3. Experience mounting anxiety and my mental block grows as days go by without me answering.
4. Convince myself that the person who sent me the text/email in the first place now hates me and thinks of me as lazy/irresponsible/uncaring.

Does anyone else have this problem? How have you been able to work through it?

My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends.

I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. "

Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I’m doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks."

b25lyk_1053,b25lyk,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

b2b1t3_1061,b2b1t3,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure. Do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?"

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me.

These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?"

I’m new here and I guess I just hope I’m not the only one that deals with this. I’m diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I’ve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I’ve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?"

just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with.

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn’t so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn’t just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like “oh maybe everyone did well” or “maybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.” I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I’ll catch myself saying things like “why is your heart beating so fast, my god you’re just getting on the bus, it’s not a big deal.” 

Anyone else? I’m curious!

I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits."

People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits."

I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn’t turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn’t even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out."

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I’M JUST SO EXCITED!!!! 

I know on my first day I’m gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish I stayed in my comfort zone but I don’t even care because this just proves to me that if I push through those nasty feelings I really can do anything!!

Thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. This has been a HUGE life changing step for me and it’s amazing to be able to share it with all of y’all.

Edit: I promise I’m done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I’m over the moon, I can’t believe I’m me and I did this haha.

However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything.

cfbfvy_1565,cfbfvy,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it"

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved."

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?"

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you’ll be fine about a certain situation

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about! 

I just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won’t know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!"

Whatever is stressing you can wait for a few minutes.  You deserve peace."

dk2os9_1979,dk2os9,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,I don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower. Idk how to explain it but I stay up till like 7am every night because I don't want the next day to be here yet. I also stay up because I feel like I have so much to do before going to sleep but then I end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?

I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can’t afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can’t afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won’t allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. Staying up late is as close as it gets. The rest of the world is asleep and I can think in peace.

dyfwbm_2080,dyfwbm,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best."

If I take too long to do something or do it wrong she yells at me. Don’t get me wrong I love my mother to pieces but when she’s yelling at me my mind kind of shuts off, I can’t even think of a response and even if I do it never comes out right. I start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100.

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think.

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain &lt;3

Merry Christmas guys x"

It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea.

I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given!

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
&gt;""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""  
- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship"

eonw76_2291,eonw76,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,"To explain, 

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

“does she actually give a shit about this?”

“you look stupid just stop”

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys."

English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!"

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that’s how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don’t want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it’s not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it’s ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON’T indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don’t know why I’m posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don’t talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I’m just in a super weird head space right now and I don’t feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can’t even tell if it’s all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn’t even exist still. Simpler times. I don’t know what I need but all I know is I feel like I’m annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it’s all just stupid anxiety.

I’m so over it. So much. 

Tips?"

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that’s how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don’t want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it’s not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it’s ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON’T indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don’t know why I’m posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don’t talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I’m just in a super weird head space right now and I don’t feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can’t even tell if it’s all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn’t even exist still. Simpler times. I don’t know what I need but all I know is I feel like I’m annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it’s all just stupid anxiety.

I’m so over it. So much.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

But this year I did tell people at my work. I told people who I’ve made friends with online, I went out for a meal. 

It has been a great day and I think it’s the first time in a long time I’ve really enjoyed my birthday. It also feel great to have let down a wall.

fbq6n2_2513,fbq6n2,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that’s my problem?"

fg3x6f_2548,fg3x6f,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?"

Before, I was getting them a few times per week and it was quite debilitating. I still have work to do. I had one because it was over a topic that I haven’t covered in therapy yet. However, I’m just glad that I’ve made this accomplishment.

People who don't have anxiety are panicking, so what the hell do you think those with anxiety will behave like?

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

g4y8e7_2806,g4y8e7,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?"

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard).

gg45u4_2900,gg45u4,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)"

gmezo7_2961,gmezo7,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

gms6fi_2969,gms6fi,top-comment,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"I’m just trying to figure out if it’s just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I’ve been there so long).

I just don’t know how to relate I guess."

This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come."

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

gqmycs_3016,gqmycs,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh."

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I fucking cant

It's like the world is trying to devour me

I just want this to stop but it always comes back, always 

I know its such self pitying bullshit but I cannot convince myself that anyone really likes me, no matter what they say, being alive is just so tiring 

I treat EVERYTHING like a freaking personal attack 
I twist every postive, kind thing the people in my life do for me and turn it into something absolutely unrecognizable

Its disgusting

I cannot make a right decision 

Posting this is wrong 

But I dont know what else to do?

But its wrong 

Writing this out has kind of been therapeutic so there's that? 

Its either I write this freakout to reddit because all other social media is terrifying rn (and people i know inhabit those, ew) or I keep scrolling through the apps on my phone endlessly while I hyperventilate 

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.
Thank you for reading.
Any helpful tips to deal would be appreciated.
I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

Whatever you are fearing right now will pass, just like everything you've feared in the past worked itself out on its own. Things may not go the way you expect them, and that's okay. That's the way life is for everyone. But everything will work itself out in the end. You will find a job, you will get that degree, you will find love, you will be successful, the terrible thing you are worried about will probably not happen, and even if something unexpected does occur you are 100% strong enough to get through it. You are stronger than you think and you will be okay. There is nothing wrong with you. You are not weird or a loser or a stereotype. You are not ugly or bad or defective. You are so much more. You are a flawed but beautiful human soul who is  so much more valuable and complex than anyone around you could ever comprehend. You are okay and you are going to be okay."

Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety. Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fiancé. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep. I told her my cat told me he was able to go now because he knew someone was there to take over for him in watching over me."

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i’m doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!"

hn7wgd_3305,hn7wgd,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?"

My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding."

I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

Kinda breaks my heart... but at least I have the memories. And the falling rain reminds me of those wonderful memories. But the sound too is just so relaxing and soothing."

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you.

I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it’s too hot, I don’t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I’m relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I’ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can’t? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I’m literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren’t as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I’m late? 

I lay there like “oh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven’t even gotten up... what is the point?” and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I’m on my way there, my depression hits and I’m beating myself up because DUH, I’m awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t think this is normal? Can anyone relate or am I crazy?"

I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels &amp; frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time &amp; we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

ibzmrv_3603,ibzmrv,op-engaged,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

When I got out of college I was broke and didn't have insurance, so I stopped going to the dentist. After a while I finally got a decent job and dental insurance, but my anxiety had become worse and my shame/avoidance behaviors kicked in. The more time that passed, the more shame I felt about not having been to the dentist. So I just didn't go. 

I don't know what changed recently, but the other day I just looked up a place with good reviews and made an appointment before I could think about it too much. I told them it had been a few years so I didn't have any x-rays to send over. Nobody made a big deal about it. The dental hygenist and the dentist were both very kind. Also, apparently these days they let you watch Netflix while your teeth are being cleaned?? Back in my day your only entertainment was the sound of metal scraping against tooth enamel. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. None of my friends know about this because I'm too embarrassed to admit to it, but I'm very proud of myself. And to anyone else struggling with avoidance, *you're not alone.* Please try and prioritize your health and ask for help if you need it. Whatever you're avoiding is unlikely to turn out half as bad as you fear."

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be."

Okay, miss rising high school junior, why don’t you take my social anxiety and depression with you? See how it feels and how difficult it is to simply “get over it”.

Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance’s nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of “Y’know I’m seeing that you’re a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don’t fly with me as a nurse.” This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real. After talking more he reluctantly suggested I go to the ED. I didn’t go immediately that night because the comments made made me feel like I was overreacting and that my need for care wasn’t important or a waste of time. I did go to the ED that afternoon around 3pm because my rash, itching, and fatigue were only getting worse. I was diagnosed with mites by the ER doctor and prescribed an anti-parasitic which has so far provided some relief. 

I’ve filed a grievance with my insurance because I feel like my dignity as a patient was violated and prevented me from seeking out care. At first I thought maybe this isn’t a big deal but after consulting with friends they said that this was unacceptable and that I should file a report. I’m kind of used to going to the doctor and having them brush things off as anxiety and it just seems like a vicious cycle cuz I never do anything about it because of my anxiety and not wanting to make it a big deal."

is6wza_3831,is6wza,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn’t think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn’t see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn’t right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It’s so fucked up. I can’t describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn’t see my partner anymore. I didn’t have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don’t know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren’t the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I’ve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I’ll try to respond to you all later today."

I’m a senior in college and the uncertainty that lies ahead of me is unbearable. I’ll go through rough phases where everything, from classes to planning for careers/grad school seems like the most daunting thing, and I just wish to stay in the present. I can’t see a light, and I feel so trapped inside myself it’s debilitating.

Other days, or periods of time shorter than days, I’ll feel like I have the ability to be and do great. In those few and far in between instances I feel sane, and relatively calm, eager for the future.

What I can’t stand the most is not controlling how i feel, and when I feel it. It’s so volatile and I can only hope that days in which important tasks take place are days I feel I’m in control. I feel like I’m slowly drowning, and I have no idea how to stop it or stabilize myself."

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was.

j61jth_3996,j61jth,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

Pass it on."

I actually got a job. I did applications, I did interviews, and I didn’t have a panic meltdown ONCE. I actually impressed people. I actually got MY FIRST JOB. 

It’s a data entry clerk position and I can work remotely and there’s minimal social interaction besides the people on my team.

I never thought I’d be able to do this honestly. I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job. 

I even opened up a bank account today for myself. 

Sure, I’m anxious about starting work and worried I’m gonna be bad at it..but that’s a problem for me later. Right now im thrilled I even did it. It can get better y’all.

Edit: thank you all for all the nice comments :)"

I don’t think I’m some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say “oh well everyone has anxiety”. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say “thank you for telling me.”

Edit: Thank you for the perspective, advice, and support. I think that those of you who suggested that the doctor is just starting at the bottom of the treatment ladder are correct. I have otherwise had good experiences with this doctor, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I do think however that he could have done better than just suggest I use a different app to do something I already indicated wasn't working.

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I’m just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't.

I feel my mental health is getting worse and I just want this to be over. I'm worried that this week will get crazy and there's nothing I can do. It's like reading a history book without knowing the outcome. How is everyone else coping through this week?

Edit: 2 things- thanks to all the replies. I've read each and every single one of them. It's a bit reassuring to see most people with the same views and worries. 
I've also been impressed with the civility in this post. Also gives me a glimmer of hope for our society.

jn9o4i_4203,jn9o4i,top-comment,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Yesterday evening my city was hit by a terrible terrorist attack. Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside. 

Whoever read this far, thank you. I don't even know why I wrote this. I guess I'm just trying to deal with it somehow."

But instead of deleting everything because of all the ""what ifs"" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).

Also I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes). I know, there's not really much to answer on here and honestly, it's just one of those days I feel like an improper human being. I think I really need a very long hug.

(Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**

**OH  MY GOD! Thank you so much for the support, people. I just wanted to  vent out my feelings because they have been bottled up for years. I am  aware that a lot of you are asking me a lot of questions but i can't  asnwer everything. So here are some stuff i can say:**

1. **Porn  addiction actually came from my low-self esteem. I think a lot of  people can relate to this. It's kind of like a loop to be honest**
2. **I respect a lot of good teachers out there that try to do good things. I never said i hated EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING in school.**
3. **Despite  a minority of people disagreeing with me and calling me overdramatic, i  would just want to point out that i am venting and not stating  anything.**

**THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT MEANS A LOT FOR ME! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3**"

The truth is, I’m not doing well. I’m so overwhelmed these days, and I can’t relax. Something is always on my mind, something is always bothering me. I’m constantly irritated, and it’s frustrating. My emotions feel invalid — I have a home, I have food on my table, what do I have to be upset or stressed over? I feel so disconnected from myself and from others. I’m afraid to reach out to others — I’ve definitely pushed a lot of people away this year. I don’t know how or if I can bounce back to whatever my *normal* was.

Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.

I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a ""normal"" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.

It’s the busiest season for my niche-insurance market and I’m tired from working 45-50hr work weeks. My anxiety keeps me from taking off work knowing I’ll feel guilty for not helping the company when they need me the most. 

Funny enough, as a result of this I was recognized for “outstanding attendance” which quickly made me realize I’m the only one not taking time off after it was announced that taking time off would be harder this time of year. Give me a freaking break. 

Anyways I took the day off to let someone else get that recognition for this month."

Fast forward to the next morning, I’m still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don’t smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It’s crappy, but true. 

Thank you for listening to my story and replying and liking it even.

(I’m 19, was 18 at the time, like it matters anyway, you shouldn’t post anyone’s personal info on social media whether they are your kid as a minor or not) Luckily she didn’t mention the psych ward part but I asked her to take it down because it’s private and no ones business but my own and my doctors but she didn’t so I had to resort to publicly commenting;

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.” 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can’t go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won’t tolerate that shit. I’m not a minor any more, I’m a grown ass adult, and if I didn’t live in her house still she wouldn’t know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

Edit;
Of course she bitch at me about it and said “take down whatever you want to take down. I’m done with it.”

How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‘t feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.

When your anxious, your mind thinks the worst possible scenario, not the most REALISTIC scenario. The worst possible scenario could have a &lt;1% chance of being true but it doesn’t feel like that in the state of anxiousness.

It’s a trap, it feels like you’re gonna be stuck like this forever, which inevitably gives you more anxiety and now you’re stuck in a loop.

Its easier said than done but learning to accept that the worst case scenario can happen seems to be the best way to deal with anxiety.

Sometimes I think of my own death and cry too-- not because of being afraid of death but because I don't want to leave my family behind. The idea that life is so fragile and one day things can drastically change scares me so much. I saw this happen to my brother in law who died from colon cancer. I'm so scared of our lives turning on a dime like that.

I used to be like this as a kid too-- but with my parents. Somehow this obsession is much worse now with my own tiny family."

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.



Your mind will follow."

I'm on break now and I decided to start seeing a therapist back home who my parents recommended to me. I told her about my anxiety and how it was affecting my ability to do schoolwork and how I'm terrified of driving so I still only have a permit at the age of 19, and how I'm really afraid of phone calls. She straight up told me that I am only acting like this ""because I like the attention"". That really bothered  me because I really want to be independent and I feel really guilty for inconveniencing other people, and I always feel guilty about having panic attacks because I know my friends and family are going to worry about me.

I always thought I could never learn how to drive and, even if I did, I was afraid of the worst outcomes (dying in a crash, killing someone, destroying my car, etc). I still can't know what the future has in store for me but at least I got over my crippling fear of driving. And today I finally got my driver's license! I am so happy and amazed at the same time, I just felt like sharing this in case anyone needed to hear it: you can do it. If anyone feels the same I used to feel about driving, I am the perfect example that nothing is impossible (and believe me, I used to be really, really BAD at it)."

Rather than advising OPs to overcome their external circumstances, people on here give them the support to manage their internal struggles because change isn’t possible without addressing that. Thank you so much to everyone on here for making 2020 feel less alone and difficult. I know what you are dealing with is awful, but I also know that you are incredible for keeping on. Wishing you a better, if not the best, year ahead."

No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

I've suffered with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety and Depression for most of my life and have always felt more at peace and happier when out in the wilderness and cut off from everybody else."

Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I’m truly touched by everyone’s suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I’ve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I’ll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this."

It has ruined my mood the whole weekend, I feel so nervous and down and on edge. 

I just want to call in sick forever and hide in bed...

😓 

I hate lying in bed at night wide awake worrying about the morning... I hate the feeling of worrying about not sleeping and it making the situation worse. 

Has anyone found a way to combat sinday blues / work anxiety after time off? 

Sending love to everyone else facing Monday...

*Edit: thank you everyone for your kind messages and replies. I love the phrase ""Sunday Scaries"", I'll be using that! 

I survived the night (barely)... horrible nights sleep. 

I think I will start trying meditation. Even though I am on medication that helps my anxiety,I have so much trouble switching my brain off at night.

But I wish, so bad that they had noticed it when I was young, that throwing up from anxiety when I had to interact with people as a kid isn't normal.

I feel like if I had a therapist or someone to help me when I was young things wouldn't have gotten this bad, that I wouldn't feel like I was stuck. I wouldn't be so isolated, I wouldn't have felt so alone my whole life.

If you have kids, and if you can, please get them some sort of therapy or counselling, even if they seem fine, I don't want anyone to grow up like I did, feeling crippled like this."

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger.

For as long as I can remember I have done this, I like to wake up super early for things and just lay there doing nothing because I feel like sleeping all the way until the stressful event is too fast and if I just lay there awake I can savor every second that I have of not doing the thing. 

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn’t like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I’m a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep. Just laid there under my blanket trying to keep my mind as blank as possible and enjoy the nothingness before my day.

I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do."

I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out.

It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running.

It affects me so much in my life when sometimes it’s not even worth it, it’s just me entertaining a unrealistic thought. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I go to sleep I am talking to myself in my brain mostly it speaks negatively it makes me overthink everything I do. I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won’t let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn’t wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it’s in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
THEN BREATHE IN. YOU SHOULD BE BREATHING IN HALF AS LONG AS YOU BREATHE OUT. YOUR LUNGS KNOW WHAT TO DO, BREATHE RIGHR FOR THEM.


you can’t relax your mind if your body is not relaxed. check these off. then calm your mind. i hope they help. ❤️

Today concludes the second week in which I sleep early and wake up comfortably. Besides complying with 5 meals a day, especially breakfast which I missed SO MUCH.
I went back to exercising, playing the guitar, playing chess online.

Other than the fact that it obviously will not magically solve all my problems that much i already know don't worry i won't be disappointed.

EDIT: Damn it i still have anxiety regarding posting i thought i had that figured out."

Like, if they dont respond to my messages after a while, I start to feel like I did something wrong and now they hate me. Or whenever I call and they dont answer, I feel like they dont want to talk to me anymore. The obvious and logical answer is that they're busy, but anxiety doesn't give a fuck about logic. Right now, one of my friends hasn't messaged me back in about a week, and my anxiety just tells me stuff like, ""What if they're not busy and just ignoring me because they hate me."" That's my biggest anxiety problem right now. And then I start to get worried that I'm too clingy and that makes my anxiety worse, making me hate everything. Does anyone else get this, and if so, how do I fix it?"

I couldn’t eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It’s like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. No chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic.

Having my ringer off makes me even more anxious because I don't know when someone has texted or called. Especially when texting my SO. There's no reason to have anxiety texting him but I always do. I am not even worried for a reason and yet my hands shake so much I can barely type.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself. I used to miss school because I would get so sick from anxiety in the morning. Does anyone else have their anxiety give them an upset stomach?"
lpa08i_5052,lpa08i,op-engaged,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength."

In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a “I want to die.” But I realize that I can’t kill myself, because I can’t do it, it’s not in me, it’s in my head but it doesn’t tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It’s a command given by a brain, but a smile. Maybe I’ll read a book, idk."

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

Suicide rates don't surprise me at all."

I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao"

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*"

I don't have a license because I hate driving...an expectation that didn't even exist before the 1900s. I hated school and struggle with work because I constantly feel I'm not smart enough for the task. I hate money and insurance because I never have enough. I hate appointments and social gatherings because people expect me to appear normal and put-together. I hate this century because I feel like a wild animal that is expected to pay taxes instead of thriving in nature and foraging for food.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget &amp; 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something &amp; I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow &amp; chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies &amp; crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC &amp; I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal &amp; feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again. I started singing again, listening to music, writing &amp; socialising with my friends."

Zoloft and mediation helped me find my road to recovery!

I went from living in fear every moment of the day to fully enjoying my life again in the space of a month.

There is always hope! I thought anxiety was going to be my life (or death)!

I was quite anxious as I’m still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I’ve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, “oh god, you’re bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.” I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a “shout out” because I handled the tough questions “like a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.” She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was “one of the best” he’d seen and he’d found it “extremely useful and insightful”. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else’s. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

UPDATE: Oh my gosh thank you so much for all the fantastically kind comments and for the awards! I honestly expected maybe 5 people to be interested in this! I’m glad my experience has resonated with so many people and I really hope it can be an encouraging little story to anyone who is battling with anxiety. I hope it shows anyone who reads it that anxiety isn’t always reflective of reality.

Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!"

I have spent an hour preparing. I have done breathing exercises to calm myself down and not cry. I prepared my bed for the ease of running away and hiding in it as soon as the phone call is done. I rehearsed my opening line and all possible outcomes. I considered just not calling, but told myself ""NO this is important, you can do this!""

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&amp;#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers"

n1smxe_5465,n1smxe,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?"

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!"

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it.

And when these patterns and behaviors are noticed they are often excited by another behavior: us resisting them, or trying to hide them.

Ive found it incredibally effective to name these behaviors as if they were characters in your head, And when they appear, simply say hello to them. Maybe thank them for trying to keep you safe, and thats it. In time, they will relax, but this cant be your goal. Acceptance of them must be your goal.

Here are some of my characters:
""The reherses future conversations guy""

""The replays past social interactions guy""

""The finds reasons to avoid things guy""

""The narrator""

""The overanalyzing my owns words as i speak guy""

""The worried that future events wont happen the way I want them to guy""

""The trying to stop current behavior guy""

""The angry i was treated unfairly guy""

And i even visualize what they look like, sometimes draw them on paper. Give them a real voice and and real nod of ackowledgement, and you detach yourself from them. They eventually lose power over you.

I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again.... 

How are you guys handling going back to some form of ""normal"" or ""before""?"

I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I’m a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine."

o5pzin_5748,o5pzin,op-engaged,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"I know there’s no way to not sound like a prude by saying this. Look, I don’t care if you use weed. If it helps you, that’s great. It helps with your anxiety? Great.

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I’m already taking. I don’t want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that’s being sold on the street to get high. I’ve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don’t* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It’s just that it’s the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So… weed. Sure, it’s “more harmless” than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance — like medication, alcohol, food — can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don’t care if it’s fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It’s always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don’t want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I’m told it’s not “that bad”. Hell, I don’t want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me.

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I’m already taking. I don’t want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that’s being sold on the street to get high. I’ve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don’t* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It’s just that it’s the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So… weed. Sure, it’s “more harmless” than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance — like medication, alcohol, food — can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don’t care if it’s fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It’s always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don’t want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I’m told it’s not “that bad”. Hell, I don’t want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace."

When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

owodyh_5897,owodyh,op-engaged,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day."
owodyh_5899,owodyh,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine.

oxcy43_5904,oxcy43,top-comment,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1," I pumped my own gas for the first time in my life yesterday. I'm an adult and have been on the road for years, I would always get someone to pump my gas for me. I know that sounds dumb but it really scared me. I always thought everyone would look at me and I would mess it up or spontaneously combust into flames (ridiculous I know). I cannot stand being in a line or somewhere that draws attention and I *hate* feeling eyes on me. 

 When I shared my victory with my husband he called me sheltered so obviously he doesn't understand. It was terrifying to exit my vehicle and stand there while I could feel people watching me, they would know if I fucked up. I didn't fuck up, it was incredibly easy. From now on I'm only pumping my own gas to avoid being in a lineup of people and talking to a cashier."

I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future."

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are.

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time."

I decided to try to let it go, since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn’t. Now, it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I’m happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn’t been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can’t even do that, and I don’t want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven’t been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don’t know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there’s nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it’s causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Overthinking.

It's also not just one run of diarrhea, it can be like an ordeal of 2 or 3 runs to the toilet. I'm really not comfortable to have these ""diarrhea runs"" at a friends or family house, as they usually get quite concerned once I start running, wondering if they did something that made me sick.

She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 

Not this time. Not with me. 

 I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her ""what's the point?"". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

Of course this isn’t every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it’s the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don’t mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day. I still have plenty of days where I am enjoying the things through the day, but even on those days when 5 hours fly by I’m like “oh bonus I’m closer to bed”.

Some days it’s like my only hope though where I am really all over the place and it’s my anchor to keep going. Idk, I’m sure it sounds bad that I “look forward to going to sleep everyday” but I find it a pretty good coping mechanism."

uxeqkv_6429,uxeqkv,top-comment,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction"

wrus19_6545,wrus19,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"Last Monday I walked in on my wife taking an excessive amount of very dangerous heart pills. And somehow I was too stupid to realize she wasn’t joking, she wanted to die. Luckily she was talking to her therapist who made her a Safety plan that I thought was a great idea. I got rid of all the guns in the house, all the pills and all was well. About 4 days later she admitted she had picked a day, a time, and how she was going to do it. Which was yesterday at 9 in the morning with about 150 pills she had hid from me. A few phone calls later she was whisked away to a crisis center. 

Now she’s gone for I don’t know how long, no visitors allowed and very little phone contact. 

Since the incident. I haven’t eaten in 4 days, I have constant panic attacks it almost feels like she did Die, I know it’s not true and she’s safe but I’m so lost I don’t know what to do.

I’ve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don’t understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

Update: I want to thank every single one of you that has wrote something for me, it makes me feel so much better knowing someone took time out of their day to give advise or encouragement. As of right now I’m at my sisters house, it’s a lot better having an adult to talk to.

I’ve since finally got a hold of my wife, I had to wait for her and I guess she was being transferred to a few different facilities before she ended up in a longer term one. Unfortunately I still can’t see her, hospital has Covid restrictions. She’s doing well and has started to have some clarity on what happened.

Thank you so much everyone you have helped me more than you know. Now the real work begins."
wrus19_6547,wrus19,top-comment,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,"Last Monday I walked in on my wife taking an excessive amount of very dangerous heart pills. And somehow I was too stupid to realize she wasn’t joking, she wanted to die. Luckily she was talking to her therapist who made her a Safety plan that I thought was a great idea. I got rid of all the guns in the house, all the pills and all was well. About 4 days later she admitted she had picked a day, a time, and how she was going to do it. Which was yesterday at 9 in the morning with about 150 pills she had hid from me. A few phone calls later she was whisked away to a crisis center. 

Now she’s gone for I don’t know how long, no visitors allowed and very little phone contact. 

Since the incident. I haven’t eaten in 4 days, I have constant panic attacks it almost feels like she did Die, I know it’s not true and she’s safe but I’m so lost I don’t know what to do.

I'm quietly proud of myself, so I just wanted to share 😊

I know some might think that's not a big step, and it's not but that's okay. Small steps are just as important, because I'm still going forward 💜"

I think those of us with anxiety are more resilient

I suffer from severe anxiety and I tend to hide my face because when I feel like people are looking at me I always feel like they think I’m repulsive. I take care of myself as much as I can, I put effort in my makeup hair and clothing. I know I am not pretty, but I never thought it was to the point that someone would come out their way just to say it to me. It just confirms that everything i was imagining in my head is true. I want to hide forever. I feel worthless and disgusting. It’s so stupid I know it. I’m crying writing that because it broke down the last bit of self confidence I have, it’s already so hard for me to go out in public and this is just my last straw."

My partner and I thought it was allergies but allergy medicine isn't working. I like to play pickup soccer and basketball and I'm still able to run fine. I've had x-rays and heart tests that are all normal. For these reasons, I've had two doctors tell me it's anxiety. I have a history with anxiety but this is generally the least anxious and most happy I've been since adulthood. So I'm wondering if I've just normalized it or maybe don't know how to to identify all forms of anxiety. Is there anyone else that's had shortness of breath from anxiety? If so, did any medications help?"

It wouldn’t start, and two of the guys was looking at me through the window. I walked back in and said my car won’t start. 

They said we needed to jump it three times.  I needed a replacement battery, they said they couldn’t do it for me. They closed in 30 minutes and couldn’t make time 

They were super understaffed, and were tired. 

I have terrible anxiety, usually I  back down. I just accept it, and try not to be a burden.  

But I told them they better make time, and it was their fault for not telling me.  To my surprise, they did it for me right away.
