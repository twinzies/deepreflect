d56opw,Anxiety,1. Anxiety makes it hard to go to sleep 2. Depression makes it hard to get out of bed 3. Drink coffee for a boost 4. Caffeine makes anxiety worse 5. Repeat,yeahforsureno,Just one of the hellish cycles that anxiety gets me caught in. Can anyone else relate?,3676,173,1568668047,"Meeeeeeee. I keep promising myself to switch over to green tea, which has less caffeine, but I love the taste of coffee too much.",262,toasterpoodle,"I keep quitting coffee because of the anxiety it causes then think, why did I quit coffee? Coffee is the best! Try it again with the same consequences.",1,r3dl3opard,"I hear you ‚Äì that loop feels like a cruel little hamster wheel.‚ÄØAnxiety spikes, you reach for caffeine to ‚Äúfunction,‚Äù the caffeine then fuels the anxiety, making it even harder to wind down, and the next morning the exhaustion drags you back into bed. You‚Äôre definitely not alone in this.

A few things that have helped me (and many others) break the cycle:

1. **Set a caffeine cutoff.** Even if it‚Äôs just ‚Äúno coffee after 2‚ÄØpm,‚Äù it gives your nervous system time to settle before bedtime.  
2. **Try a low‚Äëdose calming routine.** Warm milk, herbal tea (chamomile, lemon balm), or a short guided‚Äëmeditation can replace the coffee habit without the jittery side‚Äëeffects.  
3. **Gentle movement earlier in the day.** A brisk walk or 10‚Äëminute yoga session can burn off some of that anxious energy without the crash that late‚Äëday exercise sometimes causes.  
4. **Sleep hygiene tweaks.** Keep the bedroom cool, dim the lights an hour before sleep, and put screens away ‚Äì it signals your brain that it‚Äôs time to shut down.

It‚Äôs a process, and setbacks are normal, but gradually shifting those habits can make the cycle less tight. Hang in","

r5dver,Anxiety,Do you ever stay up late cause it‚Äôs your time to just exist?,[deleted],"If I go to sleep then the next day is gonna come so much faster, but if I stay up late I can just exist and not have to deal with the world and I can just be in my little bubble.

n0y195,Anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,SendBoobPics4ADollar,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&amp;#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&amp;#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",3269,147,1619676000,The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,1235,bruhmomentnumber46,The way you responded to that situation was absolutely beautiful.,1235,bruhmomentnumber46,"That sounds like a really stressful moment for both of you, and I‚Äôm glad you were able to stay calm and give him the space he needed. Panic attacks can hit anyone, even people who seem totally in control on the road, so your non‚Äëjudgmental response probably meant a lot.  

If you ever find yourself in a similar spot again, a few extra things can help:  
-‚ÄØAsk if he‚Äôd like you to step out of the car for a minute; sometimes just getting fresh air and changing the environment can break the cycle.  
-‚ÄØEncourage slow, diaphragmatic breathing (inhale for‚ÄØ4, hold‚ÄØ2, exhale‚ÄØ4) ‚Äì it‚Äôs a simple grounding technique that many riders find useful.  
-‚ÄØIf he‚Äôs comfortable, offering to call a friend or a crisis line can give him a safety net without pressuring him.  

You handled it with a lot of empathy, and that‚Äôs exactly what people need when anxiety strikes. Nice job, and thanks for sharing.","

hqlsf8,Anxiety,At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I‚Äôll never forget,reginald1357,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you.

And if you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs ghosted after sending that line, a quick follow‚Äëup (‚ÄúHey, sorry I got stuck, can we chat now?‚Äù) can save a lot of needless stress.

Remember, you deserve clear communication, and it‚Äôs okay to politely call out patterns that make you uneasy. You‚Äôre not being demanding‚Äîyou‚Äôre just protecting your mental health. üå±","

That's half of all your blood and resources just for the brain, and half for the rest of the whole body.

Simple things like a regular wind‚Äëdown routine, short ‚Äúmind‚Äëreset‚Äù breaks (deep‚Äëbreathing, grounding exercises, or a quick walk), and setting realistic daily goals can give your nervous system a chance to recharge.

ghiqy2,Anxiety,Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?,shoretee,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don‚Äôt have a bad relationship with any of them. I don‚Äôt consider myself anti social. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they‚Äôll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don‚Äôt want to be a broken record either. I‚Äôm sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I‚Äôm not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you‚Äôre not alone brings you some relief as well. And I‚Äôm nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I‚Äôm here.",2366,165,1589180776,"All. The. Time.

I try to shut it down whenever these thoughts start by telling myself nobody else is thinking about me or obsessing about what I said and to let it go. 

Have you ever looked up a list of cognitive distortions and tried challenging your thoughts when you start to analyze an interaction and going down the rabbit hole?

A few things that have helped me (and many others) break the cycle:

1. **Reality‚Äëcheck script** ‚Äì After a hug or goodbye, pause and ask yourself: ‚ÄúDid anyone explicitly say they‚Äôre upset?‚Äù If the answer is ‚Äúno,‚Äù write that down. Seeing it in black‚Äëand‚Äëwhite can quiet the mental replay.  

2. **Chunk the worry** ‚Äì Give yourself a short ‚Äúworry window‚Äù (e.g., 10‚ÄØminutes). If the thought pops up later, note it and deliberately set it aside until the next window. Over time the brain learns the worry isn‚Äôt urgent.  

3. **Ask directly, but lightly** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre really unsure, a quick ‚ÄúHey, everything okay?‚Äù can be phrased as caring rather than accusatory. Most people will reassure you, and you get concrete feedback instead of guessing.  

4. **Self‚Äëcompassion**","

Sending my support to you guys and I hope the world can eventually treat you better without being gaslit &lt;3",2377,123,1620396626,"I think a lot of people just don't understand what anxiety/depression actually looks like and get overwhelmed when faced with it. I try not to blame them because it's something society doesn't talk about much and can be a lot. 

When someone exhibits ""normal"" levels of stress/worry/sadness it's easy to alleviate that person's pain with support and kind words and encouragement. Plus, there's usually a light at the end of the tunnel, an end point. Someone saying they are having anxiety over a presentation at work presents it and then the stress is done. That's what a lot of people think anxiety means both because we use that word flippantly and because its what people talk about when referring to ""anxiety"". (Please know I'm not saying these people don't have anxiety or can't feel overwhelmed, I am not gatekeeping the term, just that it's harmful when we use that term in only one way). 

Then here comes someone who says they are having anxiety and are in the bathroom for an hour, having trouble breathing, can't eat, can't get out of bed. And people are like whoa whoa whoa, this isn't anxiety, this has got to be some way worse mental health issue! Especially if it keeps happening!

I guess what I'm trying to say in a very long winded way is that we have turned the words 'anxiety' and 'depression' into meaning 'stressed' and 'sad'. People can deal with those emotions, there's a definitive end to those feelings. Most don't know what to do with someone having prolonged anxiety attacks. Which is why we need to more openly discuss mental health so more of us can be informed.",234,Kiwikow,"Literally at my workplace, this happened:

All-staff meeting: HR gives presentation on wellness and taking care of your health.

Later that same day: HR messages me to scold me about a few hours of sick leave.",10,stayonthecloud,"I hear you, and it‚Äôs infuriating how ‚Äúmental‚Äëhealth week‚Äù can feel like a glossy billboard while the real, day‚Äëto‚Äëday stress gets dismissed as ‚Äúunprofessional.‚Äù‚ÄØYou‚Äôre not overreacting‚Äîbeing overwhelmed is a legitimate response to an unreasonable workload, not a character flaw.

If you feel safe doing so, consider putting your concerns in writing (email or a brief note to HR) so there‚Äôs a record of the mismatch between the company‚Äôs stated values and its actions.‚ÄØAsk for concrete accommodations: clearer expectations, reasonable deadlines, or even a short break to reset.‚ÄØAt the same time, lean on outside of work‚Äîtherapist, support groups, friends‚Äîbecause you deserve a space where your feelings are validated, not gaslit.

You‚Äôre not alone in this, and you deserve a workplace that actually practices the empathy it preaches. Hang in there, and keep advocating for yourself. üíô","

First, give yourself permission to feel the terror without judging it. Naming it (‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a panic attack right now‚Äù) can sometimes short‚Äëcircuit the escalation. Grounding tricks that focus on the senses (5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1: notice five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, one you taste) often help the nervous system reset more quickly than forced breathing.

gnfhvp,Anxiety,"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.",rubertidom,"Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

I tend to wash a couple of dishes while I‚Äôm waiting for the kettle to boil or waiting for the microwave to ping etc etc and they just get done. 

But mopping the floor becomes an impossible task because I overthink it. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just mop the floor. I‚Äôve gotta sweep first. Then I have to pick up all the stuff on the floor. Then I‚Äôve gotta make up the bucket etc etc etc. Oh and there‚Äôs no point having a clean floor if the stove is dirty. So I have to clean that first and then the wall tiles are gonna look weird if the floor is all shiny. So I‚Äôll have to clean those too... then the windows will need doing. Eh. There‚Äôs no time for all that now‚Äù then I‚Äôve made it into a whole thing. 

Stupid example, but that‚Äôs pretty much how I approach everything in life and I‚Äôm just sat here on my arse doing nothing with my life at 32 because making a phone call is too hard",134,s4few0rd,Goodness. I wish it was that easy,4,Fosad,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from‚Äîthose ‚Äúfirst‚Äëthing‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëmorning‚Äù tasks feel like a tiny death‚Äëby‚Äëa‚Äëthousand‚Äëcuts, but once you actually tackle them the relief is huge.‚ÄØThe brain loves short‚Äëterm avoidance, which is why procrastination feels so rewarding in the moment, even though it fuels the anxiety loop later on.

A couple of tweaks that can make the ‚Äúfirst task‚Äù strategy even easier:

1. **Break it down** ‚Äì Turn the scary task into the smallest possible step (e.g., open the document, write a single sentence). That way the initial hurdle feels manageable.  
2. **Pair it with a tiny reward** ‚Äì Coffee, a short walk, or a favorite playlist right after you finish can reinforce the positive association.  
3. **Use a ‚Äústarter ritual‚Äù** ‚Äì Something consistent (like a 5‚Äëminute breathing exercise) before you begin signals to your brain that it‚Äôs safe to move forward.

Give yourself permission to be imperfect; even a partial completion is a win over avoidance. You‚Äôve got this!","

POST TITLE: Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.

POST BODY: Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me.

okttam,Anxiety,I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it.,Marthmellow44,"It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a ""normal"" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Small, consistent habits** ‚Äì instead of trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything at once, pick one tiny thing (a 5‚Äëminute breathing break, a short walk, or a gratitude note) and do it daily. Over time those little wins build a buffer against panic spikes.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Professional support** ‚Äì therapy (especially CBT or ACT) and, when appropriate, medication can shift the baseline so the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù isn‚Äôt as loud.

i2jiqh,Anxiety,Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing?,xstarlesseyess,"I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!",2194,124,1596401574,"Totally get what you mean, I had/have the same issue with feeling like aaaah why am I not creating/doing useful stuff/exercising/bettering myself every minute of every day! 

I personally think it‚Äôs super common in younger folk (don‚Äôt know if that applies to you) - we‚Äôve grown up in an unstable economic situation, and we‚Äôre constantly reminded that our productivity and ability to make money define us and our futures. It‚Äôs an ingrained idea - and it‚Äôs obvious in the hustle/monetise your hobbies culture that‚Äôs so pervasive at the moment. 

That aside, being productive is great, but there are plenty of things that are equally or more valuable than being productive. Doing things you enjoy is definitely one of them! Taking time to unwind, destress, play video games, read, browse Reddit, whatever makes you happy, is a valuable and worthwhile use of your time. Is it productive? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I like to think that the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is improved mental health, relaxation, happiness - maybe not as tangible as your work days, but arguably more important. 

It‚Äôs an easy thing to accept, but hard to put into practice (from my experience, anyway). But I hope that you can work towards letting yourself have unproductive and fun days, as often as is possible - you‚Äôre only going to have one shot at life and you may as well enjoy it :)",192,wilt-ed,"Yes.

A few things that have helped me (and many others) break that loop:

1. **Schedule a tiny ‚Äúpurposeful rest‚Äù block.**‚ÄØPut 30‚ÄØminutes on your calendar as ‚Äúrecharge time‚Äù ‚Äì video games, a walk, a nap. Treat it like any other task so it feels legit.

2. **Re‚Äëframe the guilt.**‚ÄØAsk yourself, ‚ÄúWhat will I be better at tomorrow because I rested today?‚Äù The answer is usually ‚Äúmore focus, less burnout.‚Äù

I wish I could shake the tendency but I just can't seem to.  Anyone else feel this?",1990,241,1612458375,Yes I constantly think I‚Äôm doing a bad job even if I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm doing a good job. I imagine my boss considering firing me and it makes me anxious. I overanalyze every interaction we have. It‚Äôs so stressful!,463,Dpdr00,"I have a large staff, and something that often catches my attention is when I want to check in with someone, first thing I often hear is ""Am I in trouble?"" Even when I've never coached or addressed something with this person ever - I have strong relationships with my staff, lots of positive feedback over the years, and still hear this.

Here's the message I've had to push the last few years to help - ""Adults don't get into trouble. Adults are held accountable for actions.""

And accountability is NOT punishment, sometimes accountability is just a n honest conversation about what happened, why and what the plan is to fix it, with no hard feelings, no malice, only a desire to encourage and growth. I used to feel like you do, and that's largely because my parents made ""getting into trouble"" A GIANT DEAL. Punishments were frankly beyond reason, and a source of trauma. Accountability is about speaking to and taking ownership of specific actions you've taken. ""messing up"" is something that mightve gotten me punished as a child, but as an adult, I am empowered to have a plan in place to fix it. 

You're not a kid (I think)  and other adults can't punish you like a child, and if they are, quit and find a place where you esteem and respect. Why? Cuz fuck em, that's why.  

My suggestion - reach out to your manager and request a weekly review or 1x1 of your performance - or even monthly biweekly, and explain that it's to make sure you have a clear understanding of performance and where you stand. This should really be a standard in offices, but it doesn't always happen. This can help you get clear understanding which should offer stability.

Anxiety is really tough and I dealt with it  in a crippling manner for the better part of 20 years.  i am very hopeful you can find relief &lt;3",17,urinaImint,"I hear you ‚Äì that ‚Äúwhat if I mess‚ÄØ‚Ä¶‚ÄØand get in trouble‚Äù loop can feel like a constant background hum, especially when it started with strict parenting and then just followed you into adulthood. It‚Äôs easy to mistake the voice of that old fear for reality, so you end up double‚Äëchecking everything and feeling guilty the moment you pause.

A practical first step is to separate the *signal* (actual feedback from your boss or coworkers) from the *noise* (the old inner critic). Try keeping a brief ‚Äúfeedback log‚Äù: write down any concrete praise or criticism you receive, and refer back to it when anxiety spikes. Seeing the evidence can shrink the imagined threat.

Also, give yourself permission to be human. Small breaks or a moment of slack aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting in trouble‚Äù ‚Äì they‚Äôre normal parts of sustainable work. If the anxiety feels overwhelming, a short talk with a therapist (or even a trusted friend) can help re‚Äëwire that long‚Äëstanding fear. You‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôve already proven you can do the job; learning to trust that fact more than the old alarm will gradually quiet it. Hang in there!","

First, give yourself permission to be human. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúhating‚Äù anyone; you‚Äôre just trying to survive the internal battle. A gentle strategy is to set a tiny, realistic cue: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send a quick ‚Äúhey, sorry for the delay‚Äù in the next 5‚ÄØminutes.‚Äù Even a brief acknowledgment can ease the guilt and let the other person know you care.  

- Keep a simple ‚Äúbusy‚Äù auto‚Äëreply template you can copy‚Äëpaste.  
- Share (when you feel ready) a short note about your anxiety; most friends are more understanding than we assume.  

Remember, progress isn‚Äôt about perfect response times; it‚Äôs about showing up for yourself, one small step at a time. You‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôre doing better than you think.","

I have a good friend who told me last week that I didn‚Äôt realize how many people really care about and love me and that I needed to stop feeling like sharing things about my life was annoying.

I always feel like no one really wants to know what‚Äôs going on in my life or how I‚Äôm doing so I try to keep it short and go back to talking about them, and I just naturally assume that I‚Äôm a burden and that people don‚Äôt really like me.

I don‚Äôt believe it though. I don‚Äôt believe he actually likes me in any way. 

I wish I wasn‚Äôt this way.",23,i_suspect_thenargles,"I hear you ‚Äì that ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù voice can be exhausting, and it‚Äôs easy to start assuming the worst when you‚Äôve spent a lot of time doubting yourself. The good news is that the brain is pretty good at learning new patterns, even if it feels stuck right now.

First, try a tiny experiment: when someone says something kind, pause for a second and *just* notice the words, without immediately jumping to ‚Äúthey‚Äôre lying.‚Äù Remind yourself that most people don‚Äôt have the energy to be fake all the time. Writing a quick mental note like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm choosing to trust this moment‚Äù can re‚Äëwire the habit over weeks.

Second, work on the inner narrative. List three things you value about yourself (they don‚Äôt have to be grand ‚Äì being a good listener, a quirky sense of humor, etc.) and read them before social situations. When you feel the doubt creep in, replace it with one of those truths.

Lastly, give yourself permission to be imperfect. Socializing isn‚Äôt a performance; it‚Äôs a practice. The more you practice trusting others, the less your mind will default to suspicion. You‚Äôve already taken a huge step by recognizing the pattern, so keep leaning into those small, trusting moments","

g8v0l8,Anxiety,Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,annajac89,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing.

Note I‚Äôm not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù that I hated.",2001,199,1587968002,"It‚Äôs very strange to me how well I‚Äôve adapted to things. Over the past couple months I‚Äôve dropped several bad habits, some of them years old, and developed many good ones - out of necessity, mind you, but it‚Äôs been working for me. Overall, I‚Äôm in a much better headspace than I was at the start of this. 

I‚Äôm very introverted and strongly dislike my line of work, so there‚Äôs that. But my general anxiety has been much more manageable and not having to deal with the pressures of day-to-day life has been undeniably positive for me. I do miss my friends, but many of them are people I go weeks or even months without meeting with even when we‚Äôre not in quarantine.

I‚Äôm in the same boat as you - while I sincerely want covid-19 to end for the sake of the greater good, I am not ready to return to my normal life.",323,BenDanBreak,"Yes. 

Going back to work on may 11th is making me sick for several reasons.

I've been confined and working at home since march 17th. To sum up, I can't stand my collegues and hierarchy anymore. It ended in sick leave last autumn. 

So I feel better confined at home and going back to that place is disturbing me deeply already.

Moreover measures for social distancing at work have not been decided yet, but I fear the worse. There's some people who clearly doesn't care about personal space and I don't want to meet them.

School is supposed to start again on may 11th, but a majority of parents won't put their kids back and won't return to work. As a child-free woman, again i will be forced to do my collegues job in addition to mine (I'm already several months late on some subjects) and as usual, I will get no help in return only a pat on the head.

A few things that have helped people in the same boat:

1. **Ask about hybrid or flexible options.** Many companies are still open to a few days at home, which can preserve some of the commute‚Äëfree time you‚Äôve come to love.  
2. **Chunk the transition.** Treat the first few weeks as a trial period ‚Äì keep your morning walk, schedule short ‚Äúreset‚Äù breaks, and gradually re‚Äëintroduce the commute rather than diving straight back into a full‚Äëtime office schedule.  
3. **Preserve your non‚Äëwork rituals.** Keep the pet playtime, reading slots, and virtual catch‚Äëups on your calendar; they‚Äôll act as anchors when the external noise ramps up.

Remember, you don‚Äôt have to go back to exactly how things were pre‚ÄëCOVID. You have agency to shape a new ‚Äúnormal‚Äù that honors the healthier habits you‚Äôve cultivated. Hang","

That takes a huge amount of courage, especially when anxiety is trying to keep you stuck. It‚Äôs completely normal to feel your heart race, to rehearse the post a dozen times, and to worry about how people will react. Remember that the only thing you have to live up to is **your own intention to move forward**, and you‚Äôve already done that.

A couple of things that might help next time:

1. **Set a small ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù** ‚Äì give yourself 5‚Äë10 minutes to write, then post, even if it feels imperfect. The more you practice, the less power the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù thoughts have.  
2. **Keep a ‚Äúwins‚Äù list** ‚Äì note every time you push through anxiety (like this post). Seeing the list grow can be a real confidence boost.  
3. **Breathe** ‚Äì try a simple box‚Äëbreathing exercise (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) right before you hit submit; it can calm the physical symptoms.

You‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôve already taken a big step. Keep going, and be kind to yourself along the way. üå±","

First, give yourself permission to be a *different* person now. You can‚Äôt rewrite history, but you can use those memories as data rather than judgment. When a flashback hits, try a quick grounding technique (5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 senses) and then ask, ‚ÄúWhat did I learn from that situation?‚Äù Write the lesson down; it turns the memory into a concrete takeaway instead of a self‚Äëcritique.

Second, practice self‚Äëcompassion. Talk to yourself the way you‚Äôd talk to a friend who‚Äôs embarrassed about their past ‚Äì with kindness, not blame. If the anxiety feels overwhelming, consider a therapist or a support group; they can help reframe those narratives.

Couple weeks ago I was at a backyard movie night with some local friends. I'm not a big social person, and they know it, but either way I really don't have much a problem hanging out by myself or taking a break if I need.

One of the wives starts to chit chat with me, and is like *what have you been up to lately?* and honestly, the real answer is not much, working, exercising, riding my bike, walking the dog, that sort of thing, and she's like *come on throw me a bone, you have to be up to something new*, so I'm like *oh I am, I bought a jump rope the other day, and after struggling a bit I can do a couple reps of a hundred each without fucking up. You should try it, it's fun,* and that ended the conversation.

Later, I was really wondering if maybe she felt I was implying that she needed to exercise more, and it bugged me for a solid couple days.

m31qy4,Anxiety,Anyone feels like they live more in their head than in real life?,SirNatcelot,"So, I was wondering, anyone feel like this? 
I think I spend more time in my one head than in the real life. I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows. 
I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn‚Äôt. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as ""daydreaming"" but I‚Äôm almost 22 years old now‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt know if this is still a good thing.

Edit: Hey! I'm so so happy for all the support in the comments. I just wanted to say thank you to you all! This has been quite emotional for me, being able to see myself in others and the similar things we all live trough. Thank you all for being so amazing!",2026,120,1615499522,I‚Äôm 28 and am still like this. When they say ‚Äúbe your own best friend‚Äù I think I took it too far LOL.,311,Toasty-Toez,You have any heavy pieces placements in your chart ?? Lol but nah I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôve read thousands of books since childhood. I‚Äôm always fantasizing too and I need my mind to be stimulated and fully distracted so as to avoid extreme overthinking and anxiety so I get it.,4,20JC20,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs easy to slip into the ‚Äúhead‚Äëspace‚Äù when the outside world feels heavy, and the stories, shows, or day‚Äëdreams give us a safe place to practice empathy and explore feelings we might not get to express otherwise.  

The good news is that imagination isn‚Äôt a flaw‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool. The trick is finding a balance so it fuels you instead of pulling you away from real‚Äëlife connections. Try setting small, concrete goals (e.g., a short walk, a coffee with a friend, or a hobby you can actually do) and treat them like chapters in your own story. When you notice yourself drifting, gently bring your attention back to what‚Äôs happening right now‚Äîyour senses, the people around you, the texture of the moment.  

If the ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù feelings persist, consider talking to a counselor or therapist; they can help you unpack why the real world feels so rough and give you strategies to stay grounded while still enjoying the rich inner world you love. You‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôve already taken a big step by sharing this. Keep exploring both worlds‚Äîyou deserve both the comfort of imagination and the richness of real‚Äëlife experiences.","

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I‚ÄôM JUST SO EXCITED!!!! 

I know on my first day I‚Äôm gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish I stayed in my comfort zone but I don‚Äôt even care because this just proves to me that if I push through those nasty feelings I really can do anything!!

Thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. This has been a HUGE life changing step for me and it‚Äôs amazing to be able to share it with all of y‚Äôall.

Edit: I promise I‚Äôm done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I‚Äôm over the moon, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm me and I did this haha.

I totally get the mix of excitement and the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù nerves that will pop up on day‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì it‚Äôs normal to feel that way after stepping out of your comfort zone.

A few things that helped me when I was in the same spot:

1. **Prep a ‚Äúgo‚Äëto‚Äù script** for the first few days (introductions, key projects you‚Äôll be working on, questions you want to ask). Having it written down takes the mental load off.  
2. **Schedule short ‚Äúreset‚Äù breaks** ‚Äì a quick walk, a few deep breaths, or a 5‚Äëminute mindfulness app can calm the surge of anxiety without missing a beat.  
3. **Give yourself permission to be a beginner.** No one expects you to know everything right away; ask for clarification when you need it and celebrate the small wins.

You‚Äôve already proven you can handle the tough moments, so keep leaning on that confidence. We‚Äôre all cheering you on‚Äîgo crush it! üöÄ","

hylc6u,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxious when being yelled at, or just hearing someone raise their voice?",rlyns319,I've noticed here recently that my chest gets tight and I can hardly breathe when being yelled at or hearing someone raise their voice in general. Does anyone have a way to calm themselves when this happens?,1970,162,1595823131,"I don't have any advice, but yeah, I don't like people yelling or raising their voices. I've never liked conflict, even if it wasn't directed at me. I used to cry even at 17 as my dad yelled at my addict and alcoholic older brother. If I didn't mind my dad yelling, I wouldn't still be having nightmares about arguments 5 years after moving out. People lecturing me/talking to me in a disapproving way is enough to make me cry and shut down. Something in particular comes to mind. I also had nightmares from that. I've tried explaining to people even if they aren't physically yelling at me, my reaction is no different than if they were. It's all the same to me if someone is upset with me. 

I have to remind my husband to not raise his voice when we are debating/disagreeing on something unimportant.",233,SensitiveBugGirl,[deleted],1,[deleted],"I totally get what you‚Äôre describing ‚Äì it‚Äôs like your body hits the ‚Äúfight‚Äëor‚Äëflight‚Äù switch the moment someone‚Äôs voice spikes, and the tight‚Äëchest, shallow‚Äëbreathing feeling can be really scary.  

A few things that have helped me (and many others) in those moments:

1. **Grounding breath** ‚Äì try the 4‚Äë4‚Äë6 rule: inhale for‚ÄØ4‚ÄØseconds, hold for‚ÄØ4, then exhale slowly for‚ÄØ6. The longer exhale signals your nervous system to calm down.  
2.‚ÄØ**Body scan** ‚Äì silently note the sensation in each body part (feet, legs, hands, shoulders). Shifting focus away from the yelling can reduce the panic response.  
3. **Mini‚Äëpause** ‚Äì if you can, step out of the room for a quick glass of water or a brief walk. Even a 30‚Äësecond break breaks the feedback loop.  

If this happens often, consider talking to a therapist; they can teach tailored coping tools and explore any underlying anxiety. You‚Äôre not alone, and with a few practiced techniques it can become much more manageable. Hang in there!","

A few things that helped me (and many others) after a breakthrough like this:

1. **De‚Äëbrief** ‚Äì After you pull over, jot down what went well and what felt tricky. Seeing the positives on paper reinforces confidence.  
2. **Gradual exposure** ‚Äì Keep stacking short highway runs (10‚Äë15‚ÄØmin) before tackling longer trips. Consistency beats ‚Äúall‚Äëor‚Äënothing.‚Äù  
3. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì Deep breaths, a favorite playlist, or a calming playlist can keep anxiety at bay while you‚Äôre in traffic.  
4. **Celebrate** ‚Äì Treat yourself to something you enjoy afterward; it creates a positive association with driving.

First, give yourself credit for surviving high school and university despite that wall; that takes a lot of inner strength.‚ÄØSecond, remember that the ‚Äúparty‚Äëlife‚Äù you imagined isn‚Äôt a universal benchmark of happiness‚Äîmany people look back and wish they‚Äôd spent those nights differently, too.  

If you want to reclaim some of that social texture now, start small: a coffee with one friend, a low‚Äëkey hobby group, or an online community that meets in person.‚ÄØGradual exposure can reshape the anxiety narrative without forcing you into situations that truly feel uncomfortable.  

Lastly, consider talking to a therapist (if you aren‚Äôt already). They can help you process the past grief while building tools for the social life you *do* want now. You deserve both compassion for where you‚Äôve been and excitement for what‚Äôs still possible. üå±","

Of course this is making me panic more but I'm trying to remind myself the the mind is a crazy thing and all of these sensations are commonly experienced as a symptom of anxiety.

jqxmtr,Anxiety,"Does anyone else write essay-like, highly emotional posts only to think ""nah"" and delete the whole thing?",Valemie,"Hello fellow anxious people. Fist of all, If you have or had a shit day, I'm sorry and I hope tomorrow will be better for you.

But instead of deleting everything because of all the ""what ifs"" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).

Also I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes).

A couple things that have helped me in moments like this:  

1. **Give the draft a ‚Äúparking spot.‚Äù** Save the essay in a notes app or a Word doc, label it ‚Äúlater,‚Äù and step away. When you come back with a little distance, you can decide if you really want to share or just keep it as a personal vent.  

2. **Micro‚Äëtasks over ‚Äúbig work.‚Äù** Break the thing you‚Äôre procrastinating on into the tiniest possible step (e.g., open the file, write one sentence). Even a 2‚Äëminute win can quiet that lump in your throat.  

3. **Self‚Äëhug practice.** Put your arms around yourself, squeeze gently, and breathe in for four counts, out for six. It‚Äôs silly but it tricks your nervous system into calming down.

POST TITLE: Does anyone else write essay-like, highly emotional posts only to think ""nah"" and delete the whole thing?

POST BODY: Hello fellow anxious people. Fist of all, If you have or had a shit day, I'm sorry and I hope tomorrow will be better for you. And secondly, yes, initially this was indeed another one of those essays and let me tell you I'm emotionally drained now, still anxious though of course. But instead of deleting everything because of all the ""what ifs"" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).

Also I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes). I know, there's not really much to answer on here and honestly, it's just one of those days I feel like an improper human being. I think I really need a very long hug.

uxeqkv,Anxiety,I don't think a lot of people realise how much of a disability anxiety can be.,Anxietyshmuck,"Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction",1846,156,1653476118,"Not to mention it's physically exhausting too.

Anxiety can feel like an invisible wall that blocks even the most routine tasks‚Äîcalling the doctor, grabbing groceries, or just walking into a room full of strangers. It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust shyness‚Äù or laziness; it‚Äôs a real, physiological response that hijacks the confidence you‚Äôre talking about.

A couple of things that have helped many people in a similar spot:

1. **Small, repeatable exposure** ‚Äì pick one tiny thing that feels just slightly uncomfortable (e.g., ordering a coffee) and do it repeatedly. The nervous system learns that the feared outcome rarely happens, and confidence builds gradually.  
2. **Grounding & breathing tools** ‚Äì techniques like the 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath or the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory grounding exercise can calm the fight‚Äëor‚Äëflight surge long enough to act.  
3. **Professional support** ‚Äì CBT or an anxiety‚Äëfocused therapist can give you concrete strategies and, if needed, medication to level the playing field.

em0e7a,Anxiety,Unclench your jaw,isweedglutenfree,Whoever needs this reminder :) I usually do,1829,155,1578523924,"Luckily my anxiety has kept me from going to the dentist for years and enabled horrible hygiene so if I clench it hurts. 

Did I win..?",217,SalmonBarn,I honestly think that I need a professional massage because of how much my muscles hurt from the tension that my panic disorder causes me to have.,31,angelathefirefly,"I totally get it‚Äîmy jaw ends up clenched even when I‚Äôm just reading or scrolling, and by the time I notice it I‚Äôve already got a mini ‚Äútension headache.‚Äù It‚Äôs one of those sneaky habits that slips in when you‚Äôre stressed or concentrating.

A quick trick that‚Äôs helped me is the ‚Äújaw‚Äërelease check‚Äëin‚Äù: every hour, gently let your mouth fall open a millimeter, feel the muscles relax, then close normally. Pair it with a few deep breaths and a light neck stretch, and you‚Äôll notice the tension and the urge to grind melt away. 

If you have a day where the tension builds, try a warm compress or a gentle self‚Äëmassage on the jawline and temples. Chewing sugar‚Äëfree gum or using a silicone bite‚Äëplate can also give the muscles a chance to ‚Äúreset.‚Äù Keep reminding yourself‚Äîyour body will thank you!","

A few things that have helped me (and a lot of folks on here) are:  

1. **Timing & amount** ‚Äì limit caffeine to the morning and keep it under 150‚ÄØmg (about one small cup). That gives you the boost without the crash later.  
2. **Swap in gentle alternatives** ‚Äì try green tea, matcha, or even a warm mug of herbal ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù (dandelion root) for the ritual without the spike.  
3. **Consistent sleep & movement** ‚Äì short walks, stretching, or a 10‚Äëminute sunrise routine can lift energy more sustainably than caffeine.

A few things that might help you settle in:

1. **Set tiny, realistic goals** each day (e.g., ‚Äúfinish this spreadsheet‚Äù or ‚Äúreply to one email‚Äù). Small wins build confidence and keep overwhelm at bay.  
2. **Create a routine** around your remote setup‚Äîconsistent start/end times, a dedicated workspace, and short breaks can give your day structure without feeling restrictive.  
3. **Keep communication open**. If something feels unclear, ask your teammates; most people appreciate the initiative and it reduces the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs expected‚Äù anxiety.  
4. **Track your progress** in a notebook or a simple spreadsheet. Seeing how far you‚Äôve come is a great antidote to self‚Äëdoubt.  

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to feel nervous at first‚Äîmost new hires do. You‚Äôve already proven you can handle the application and interview process, so trust that skill set to carry you through the job itself. Good luck, and enjoy the new chapter! üöÄ","

I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

It‚Äôs completely normal for the grief to feel overwhelming right now‚Äîyour cat was your therapist, confidant, and family all rolled into one.

Give yourself permission to mourn in whatever way feels right: talk about him, keep a little photo or a favorite toy, and let your fianc√©‚Äôs presence be a reminder that you‚Äôre still being cared for. If the sadness, it might help to write down some of the moments that made you smile and read them when you‚Äôre feeling low. Eventually, you may find comfort in volunteering at a shelter or, when you feel ready, opening your home to another cat who needs that same love. Until then, lean on your support system and remember that honoring his memory is a way of keeping his love alive in you. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

It‚Äôs understandable to mistake that emptiness for ‚Äúpeace,‚Äù especially when your brain is exhausted and can‚Äôt muster the energy to worry any more.  

The tricky part is that both states are still signaling that something‚Äôs off; the numbness of depression isn‚Äôt a healthy baseline, it‚Äôs just a different way of being stuck. If you haven‚Äôt already, consider reaching out for professional help ‚Äì a therapist or psychiatrist can help you untangle the cycle and give you tools (or medication, if appropriate) to move toward a more stable, engaged mood.  

In the meantime, tiny self‚Äëcare actions can make a difference: regular sleep, brief walks, grounding exercises, or even just a short ‚Äújust‚Äëlike‚Äëthis‚Äù task (like washing a few dishes).

3. **Reward yourself** ‚Äì after the interview, give yourself a small treat (a favorite snack, a walk, or a quick binge‚Äëwatch episode) to reinforce the progress you‚Äôve made.

Another useful habit is to remind yourself that the majority of Redditors are just scrolling past‚Äîthey‚Äôre not actively judging you. If a few down‚Äëvotes happen, they‚Äôre usually about the content, not you as a person.  

Finally, give yourself permission to be imperfect. Every post you make, even the ones that flop, builds confidence for the next one. Keep taking those small steps‚Äîyou‚Äôll find the anxiety loosens its grip over time.","

And I disagree a tad - IMO a lot of CBT was BS 'positive thinking' (which may be just as unrealistic as negative thibking).",23,x131e,"I hear you ‚Äì it can feel like CBT is just telling you the obvious, ‚Äúyour anxiety isn‚Äôt logical,‚Äù while you‚Äôre already exhausted from fighting it all day. The trick: instead of trying to out‚Äëreason the brain, give it a tiny break and then gently re‚Äëtrain it.  

One practical tweak is the ‚Äúpause‚Äëand‚Äëlabel‚Äù habit: when a worry spikes, pause for a breath, name the feeling (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling a surge of fear‚Äù) and then give it a brief, non‚Äëjudgmental note (‚ÄúOkay, my brain is on high alert right now‚Äù). After you‚Äôve acknowledged it, you can choose a small, concrete action‚Äîlike a 5‚Äëminute walk or a grounding exercise‚Äîrather than diving straight into ‚Äúit‚Äôs irrational.‚Äù  

The key is compassion, not perfection. Your brain is doing its best to keep you safe; you can slowly teach it that not every threat is real, one tiny step at a time. You‚Äôve got this.","

Lol okay thank you so much for that insight, very helpful, I had no idea",250,riffrach,Yes it happens from time to time.

You‚Äôre not alone; a lot of us have that ‚Äúsleep‚Äëanxiety‚Äù loop, especially when work or other responsibilities feel overwhelming.

First, try to give yourself a tiny ritual before bed that signals ‚Äúit‚Äôs safe to rest.‚Äù Even 5 minutes of gentle breathing, a short gratitude list, or listening to a calming podcast can cue your brain that sleep isn‚Äôt a shortcut to stress, it‚Äôs a recharge.  

If the morning feels impossible, break it into micro‚Äësteps: lay out clothes, set a simple breakfast, and schedule one small, doable task for the first hour. Knowing you have a concrete, low‚Äëpressure start can make the whole day feel less monstrous.  

Lastly, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor ‚Äì they can help untangle the underlying anxiety and give you tools tailored to your situation. You deserve a night‚Äôs rest, and you‚Äôre already doing the hardest part by acknowledging how you feel. Hang in there. üåô‚ú®","

It‚Äôs completely normal for the body to react with a panic attack or tears after a big emotional leap; you‚Äôve basically forced yourself to sit with feelings that, for a long time, have been on the back burner.  

Give yourself permission to rest and ‚Äúcocoon‚Äù for a bit‚Äîrecharging isn‚Äôt a setback, it‚Äôs part of the healing process. When you feel a little steadier, try jotting down any thoughts that came up during the session or the panic attack; that can help you and your therapist spot patterns later.  

Remember, therapy is a marathon, not a sprint. One appointment is just the first mile. Keep leaning on the supportive comments here, and take each step at a pace that feels safe for you. You‚Äôve already proven you can take that step‚Äînow you can keep walking forward, one breath at a time. üå±","

jgczkl,Anxiety,I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized &amp; social anxiety disorder.,capo-22,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning.

A couple of things that have helped people in a similar spot:  
1. **Talk to a therapist** (even a brief weekly check‚Äëin) who gets high‚Äëfunctioning anxiety ‚Äì they can help you untangle the over‚Äëanalysis without shattering your routine.  
2. **Give yourself permission to be imperfect**. Try small, low‚Äëstakes moments where you let a friend see a tiny slip‚Äëup; it can slowly erode the fear of being ‚Äúfound out.‚Äù  
3. **Mind‚Äëbody tools**‚Äîbrief grounding exercises or a 5‚Äëminute meditation before social interactions can quiet the inner critic.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

gwfrjt,Anxiety,Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,kukkelii,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.",1735,75,1591270601,"Trust me, I understand completely. How you feel, is how I have felt in the past and even now when I feel somewhat better. Doesn't take much to send me all the way back to square one and I can't leave the house.

A few things that might help while you‚Äôre still on benzos (since they‚Äôre clearly giving you some relief):

1. **Find a GI specialist** who can work with a mental‚Äëhealth provider. Even if they say the conditions are ‚Äúunrelated,‚Äù a coordinated approach (diet tweaks, fiber‚ÄØ/‚ÄØpsyllium, possibly low‚ÄëFODMAP, and anxiety‚Äëfocused therapy) often works better than two isolated treatments.

If you can, reach out to a friend, therapist, or a support community (r/Anxiety, r/BodyPositivity) and remind yourself that you‚Äôre not alone. Practicing small self‚Äëcompassion exercises‚Äîlike naming three things you like about yourself that aren‚Äôt about looks‚Äîcan slowly chip away at that inner critic. You deserve a life where you feel safe and valued, and this one cruel encounter isn‚Äôt the end of that story. Hang in there. You‚Äôre worth so much more than anyone‚Äôs rude opinion.","

homwjx,Anxiety,I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.,protodro,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.",1689,103,1594378697,"Same.

Unfortunately there is nothing to do but process it.

I am sorry for being a downer but I have realized we need to process our pasts multiple times.

This causes me anxiety because I want my children's childhood to be perfect but there is no such thing as perfect and all of us have our own destiny.

I wish you luck.",7,presentress,"I‚Äôm really sorry you had to experience that. It makes total sense that a physical punishment paired with an injury would teach you to associate ‚Äúmaking a mistake‚Äù with fear and shame rather than with the normal, human‚Äëto‚Äëerr feeling most of us learn later in life.

The good news is that the brain is still plastic enough for you to re‚Äëwire that response. Here are a few things that tend to help:

1. **Name the feeling** ‚Äì When panic spikes, simply say to yourself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling anxious because I made a mistake,‚Äù without judging it. Labeling reduces its intensity.  
2. **Grounding & breath work** ‚Äì A 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath or the ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù sensory grounding exercise can pull you out of the fight‚Äëor‚Äëflight loop.  
3. **Self‚Äëcompassion scripts** ‚Äì Try speaking to yourself as you would to a child who fell and hurt their knuckle: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre safe now. Everyone gets hurt sometimes.‚Äù Write a few lines and keep them handy.  
4. **Therapeutic support** ‚Äì A therapist trained in trauma‚Äëinformed CBT or EMDR can help process that early conditioning more deeply.

First, give yourself permission to prioritize mental health *and* your academics. Many schools have resources like counseling, disability services, or academic advisors who can help you set up accommodations (e.g., flexible attendance policies, deadline extensions, or a reduced course load). Reaching out can feel scary, but a college‚Äôs responsibility is to support students in exactly this situation.

Second, try breaking the cycle into bite‚Äësize steps. Pick one class you feel most able to attend, even if it‚Äôs just for the first 15‚ÄØminutes, and use that time to collect notes or recordings you can review later. Pair that with a short, realistic study schedule (e.g., 30‚ÄØminutes a day) so the workload feels manageable rather than overwhelming.

Your brain is basically on high alert, so background chatter, traffic, or even the hum of a fan can become overwhelming and irritating. You‚Äôre not alone; heightened auditory sensitivity is a pretty common ‚Äúanxiety‚Äësymptom‚Äù that many people experience.

A few things that might help:  

* **Noise‚Äëfiltering headphones or earplugs** ‚Äì white‚Äënoise or calming music can mask the background chatter without completely shutting you off.  
* **Grounding techniques** ‚Äì focusing on a tactile sensation (like holding a cold bottle or pressing your feet into the floor) can pull attention away from the noise.  
* **Controlled breathing** ‚Äì slow, diaphragmatic breaths activate the parasympathetic system and often dull the ‚Äúhyper‚Äëvigilant‚Äù response.  

If it‚Äôs happening a lot, consider chatting with a therapist; they can teach you specific coping tools (e.g., CBT or exposure work). In the meantime, be kind to yourself‚Äîyour brain is just trying to protect you, even if it feels noisy. Hang in there!","

A couple things that sometimes help after a ‚Äúbig‚Äù outing:  

1. **Give yourself a debrief** ‚Äì journal or just talk (to a therapist, friend, or even a supportive subreddit) about what went well and what felt hard. Naming the moments can turn anxiety into data you can work with next time.  

2. **Celebrate the sensory wins** ‚Äì notice how the colors, smells, or the feeling of holding a cart felt. Those little sensory anchors can become positive reference points.  

3. **Plan a gentle reward** ‚Äì maybe a calming tea, a favorite song, or a short walk. Your brain loves pairing effort with pleasure, reinforcing the habit.

n1smxe,Anxiety,"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.",hey_hi_hello73,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",1658,110,1619785178,"I do not know how you will feel and experience the after effects of this. I'm not sure if my advice will help you. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the thought of how myself, my loved ones, and my dog could be injured while I am driving them around. And then I go for a few short drives to a nearby drivethrough to help normalise it in my head again.

This part I'm not sure will help, but it helps me. Tragedies can occur at any moment whether you're in a car or not. They provide such great quality of life, I'm willing to risk the danger of driving. I'm not willing to risk the danger of not driving. I can drive people to the hospital. I can drive people to school and work, and greatly improve the quality of their life.

I remind myself that cars are designed to be struck. You could have been a walking pedestrian when that car went off the road, but you were in your car. You were in the safest place you could possibly be. Your car did a good job. I'm so thankful that your car was there for you.

Your experience sounds like a really scary one. I would be quite shaken up for a while. When you get a car again, I would make your first drive to a fun place. Maybe a nearby garden centre? And you can try to look forward to it in the meantime.",358,LovesRabbits,Oh that‚Äôs so horrible! Sometimes things like that happen....you always think it won‚Äôt happen to you until it does right? The worst part about it is now driving will be another trigger for your anxiety because of ptsd! Hope things get better for u....I will send positive vibes ur way ;),178,Snowfreak2507,"I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that‚Äîwhat a terrifying cascade of events. First off, you did exactly the right thing by pulling over, turning on your hazards, and calling for help; you kept yourself and other drivers out of even greater danger. The other motorist‚Äôs reckless texting and failure to stop makes him fully responsible, not you.

It‚Äôs completely normal for a trauma like this to stir up new anxiety or even flash‚Äëbacks. You might start noticing a tighter chest, racing thoughts, or an urge to avoid the road‚Äîthose are classic stress responses, not a sign you‚Äôre ‚Äúweak.‚Äù Consider talking to your therapist (or a trauma‚Äëspecialized counselor) about a short‚Äëterm coping plan: grounding exercises, controlled breathing, and a gradual exposure schedule (maybe start with short trips in familiar neighborhoods).

POST TITLE: I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.

POST BODY: I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?

fq8z5a,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?",PeekAtChu1,"Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don‚Äôt mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it‚Äôs not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort.

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre ‚Äúfaking‚Äù it; it‚Äôs a real physiological cascade. It can help to give yourself a quick ‚Äúreset‚Äù when you notice the symptoms: a few minutes of deep belly breathing, a short walk, or grounding with your senses can blunt the stress surge. If these episodes keep happening, a check‚Äëin with a doctor is wise ‚Äì they can rule out any medical cause and maybe suggest CBT or an anxiety‚Äëfocused therapist.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
&gt;""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

But I know we can get through it, and you can too.",193,Blebonick,,0,,"Hey, I really felt the hug you sent out ‚Äì thank you for that. I know the midnight‚Äëscroll‚Äëmarathon all too well; the news cycle can feel like a tidal wave that never lets up, and the anxiety that rides it can make even simple things (like a shower) feel impossible.  

A couple things that have helped me break the loop:  

1. **Set a ‚Äúnews cutoff.‚Äù** Pick a time (even if it‚Äôs just 8‚ÄØpm) and close the tabs. Put a timer on your phone so you can‚Äôt keep scrolling past it.  

2. **Grounding micro‚Äërituals.** When the brain spikes, focus on a concrete, 5‚Äësecond task ‚Äì washing your hands, feeling the texture of a sock, or naming three sounds in the room. It pulls you out of the endless ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù spiral.  

3. **Compassionate self‚Äëtalk.** Remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay to feel scared; you‚Äôre not failing, you‚Äôre just human.  

You‚Äôre definitely not alone, and every little step you take toward calm is a win. Sending you a big, virtual hug back.","

One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""  
- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship

My anxiety goes up right before i go in and I end up getting sick and calling off or just not showing up. I'm a terribly unreliable worker.

4 years ago I went thru a tumultuous divorce from a marriage making my anxiety worse everyday. So from then on I've been out of work and my partner has been taking care of me. A series of events that I'd rather not go into happened and I was pushed to finally get back into the work force. 

Im an animal person and for some months been debating on going to school to become a vet tech. On the 11th I got hired to work at an animal shelter I use to occasionally volunteer for. The director was slightly reluctant to hire me because again I was a flake during volunteering partly because my anxiety/overall mental health and the fact it wasn't a real job made me not take it seriously. 

Well its been my first week and I haven't had any panic attacks at work or felt the urge to call off or been late. I hope i can keep this up as I really like my job and the staff is pretty good. 

I feel like I've turned the corner on my anxieties and hope i can go back to being the strong person I once was.

Enjoy the animals, sounds like a wonderful job!",48,csb7566381,"Hey man, first off ‚Äì huge congrats on landing the job and getting through the first week without a single hiccup. I know how brutal anxiety can be when it hijacks your body *and* your schedule, so it‚Äôs a massive win that you‚Äôve managed to keep it at bay.

A couple of things that helped a lot of folks in similar spots:

1. **Ritualize the start‚Äëof‚Äëday** ‚Äì a short ‚Äúpre‚Äëshift‚Äù routine (coffee, a 5‚Äëminute walk, a grounding exercise) signals to your brain that you‚Äôre moving into work mode and can blunt that panic surge.  
2. **Micro‚Äëgoals** ‚Äì instead of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be a flake ever again,‚Äù focus on ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be on time today‚Äù and then ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay for the whole shift.‚Äù Small wins stack up and reinforce confidence.  
3. **Backup plan** ‚Äì keep a quick script or a trusted friend you can text if anxiety spikes.","

jwo1kd,Anxiety,You are strong . Anxiety is hell. We live through our fears and survive it everytime.,baby_3pac_1985,"A lot of people who don't deal with anxiety, or have a panic disorder/generalized anxiety disorder think it's just fear, or being nervous. It is WAY deeper than that. We go through hell. It is more than just having a "" phobia "" . It is really scary to go through . For some of us it's like being on a bad trip of LSD or weed 24/7 . To everyone reading this , don't be ashamed of your anxiety. You are a freaking warrior. A freaking soldier. I don't care if your anxiety ""isn't as bad"" as others , or if you don't feel included because you haven't felt the most severe of panic attacks. Maybe your panic attacks are small.

Thank you my friend.",127,MikaElyse8954,"This kind of life is cruel my dude, am sorry but this mental illness is up there with schizophrenia. I tried to find an up side to this, but I can't. I got nothing because I'm too afraid to do anything. When I do something it never works out, because I do it exquisitely terribly. At some point, people ask you, what's wrong with you? But you don't get it either. Some people have no time for such, so how is this honorable or courageous in any way? There is no prize at the end of the line, we just die, how sad is that. What are we fighting for?",40,[deleted],"I hear you.‚ÄØAnxiety can feel like a constant, unwanted soundtrack that drowns out everything else, and the panic spikes can feel like a crash‚Äëlanding on a roller‚Äëcoaster you never signed up for. Knowing you‚Äôre not ‚Äújust nervous‚Äù is the first step in giving yourself permission to treat it seriously.

A couple things that have helped me (and many others) are:

* **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory exercise or simply naming what you see, hear, feel, smell, and taste can pull you out of the spiral in the moment.  
* **Regular ‚Äúreset‚Äù habits** ‚Äì short daily walks, breathing apps, or a brief meditation make the nervous system less likely to over‚Äëreact when stress shows up.  
* **Professional support** ‚Äì a therapist who knows CBT or ACT can give you tools to re‚Äëframe the fear, and medication can be a legitimate aid when the brain‚Äôs chemistry is out of balance.

Remember, every small victory is still a victory. You‚Äôre doing the hard work of surviving and, more importantly, thriving. Keep leaning on the community‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. üå±","

lpa08i,Anxiety,Please start exercising,Alexle0,"I‚Äôve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who said they‚Äôre unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you‚Äôre having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",1521,208,1613951549,Proud of you.,202,TheSeasoner91,"I used to play team sports before the pandemic, and I'm a firm believer that that was one of the only things keeping my hidden depression/anxiety at bay. We were very briefly allowed to play again at the end of summer last year and I improved dramatically, and now it's stopped again I'm back to being a mess! Exercise is sooo good for you!",121,marveldinosaur99,"Hey, first off ‚Äì wow, what a turnaround you‚Äôve managed in such a short time. I can only imagine how terrifying those ER visits and panic attacks felt, and it‚Äôs completely understandable that you‚Äôd be hyper‚Äëaware of every little sensation.  

Exercise is a powerful tool, but the fact that you‚Äôre listening to your body (R.I.C.E. when you need it, scaling back when you‚Äôre sore) is just as important as the workouts themselves. If you ever hit a plateau or the anxiety spikes again, consider pairing your routine with a few grounding techniques ‚Äì short diaphragmatic breathing, a quick body‚Äëscan, or even a 5‚Äë

minute meditation right after you finish a set. They can help bridge the gap between the physiological benefits of movement and the mental calm you‚Äôre seeking.  

Also, keep a simple log of what you did, how you felt, and any anxiety level (0‚Äë10). Seeing the patterns on paper can be incredibly reassuring and give you concrete evidence of progress.  

Congrats on reclaiming your humor and confidence ‚Äì you‚Äôve earned it. Keep pacing yourself, stay kind to your body, and know you‚Äôve got a whole community cheering you on. üåü","

1. **Treat the first few weeks like a ‚Äúrefresher‚Äù** ‚Äì drive in low‚Äëtraffic areas, stick to familiar routes, and resist the urge to push your limits until you feel comfortable.

2. **Create a ‚Äúquick‚Äë‚Ä¶ checklist‚Äù** ‚Äì mirrors, seat, seatbelt, turn signals, and a quick scan of the surroundings before you move. It becomes second nature fast.

3. **Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself** if you make a tiny mistake. Everyone does; the important part is learning from it and moving on.

Enjoy the freedom, stay safe, and keep logging those miles‚Äîyou‚Äôll be a confident driver before you know it! üöóüí®","

lqt7cs,Anxiety,"The whole world seems excited for lockdown to end, but no one seems to be talking about those of us who are feeling anxious about normal life returning. Surely I am not on my own?",Silent_scroller94,"This has been a strange year for everyone, with huge life changes for all and so much sadness throughout. Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way. 

My relationship with my girlfriend ended almost 2 months ago now, and whilst there have been good days and bad days, I can‚Äôt help shake this feeling of dread and anxiety over normal life returning. It‚Äôs as if life is going to take off full speed ahead and I‚Äôm going to be left in its wake, struggling to adjust to this new single way of life. 

Everything you hear on the news speaks about excitement, parties, pubs, nightclubs and all the ‚Äòjoy‚Äô that this is going to bring, but no one seems to address the fact that it‚Äôs going to be a real struggle to adjust back into this ‚Äònormal‚Äô way of life for many of us.

I also think it's helpful to understand that when people say this, they are probably more excited about the idea of getting out of isolation and I would bet more people than not are probably having some feelings of dread at the thought of returning to ""normal"". There's a lot of truth in what you said ""Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way."" Honestly, a lot of the talk about getting back to normal is probably a product of people not knowing what to say. Lockdown has sucked for most everyone for various reasons and I know I'm guilty of saying I'm looking forward to a return to normal when I really don't mean it - I just don't know what to say!  I've been lucky enough to have an office job and have been remote except for maybe 15 days since March and it gives me a lot of anxiety when I think back on what was normal for me a year ago vs. now.",17,SecretSunflower1,"I hear you ‚Äì the idea of ‚Äúgetting back to normal‚Äù can feel like a huge, unwanted pressure, especially when you‚Äôre still processing a breakup. It‚Äôs completely normal to feel anxious about re‚Äëentering a world that‚Äôs suddenly buzzing with parties, pubs, and crowds while you‚Äôre still figuring out what single life looks like for you.

First, give yourself permission to take things at your own pace. You don‚Äôt have to jump into every social invitation; it‚Äôs okay to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need a low‚Äëkey night.‚Äù‚ÄØSet small, manageable goals ‚Äì maybe a coffee with a friend, a walk in a busy park, or a short workout class ‚Äì and let those be your stepping stones back into the rhythm you want.

Second, lean on the support you already have. Talk to trusted friends or family about how you‚Äôre feeling; often just verbalising the dread makes it less intimidating. If the anxiety feels overwhelming, consider a therapist or a support group ‚Äì many are offering virtual sessions still.

Finally, remember that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is a moving target. The post‚Äëpandemic world is reshaping for everyone, and you have the right to shape your own version of it. You‚Äôre definitely not alone, and with a bit of self‚Äë","

a5w4nc,Anxiety,I JUST CALLED INTO A PIZZA PLACE!!!,itdoesntevenrhyme,"I'm still shaking. Making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety.

A couple things that helped me (and might help you too):
1. **Prep a script** ‚Äì write down exactly what you want to say, even the opening line. Reading it aloud a few times makes the actual call feel more like reading a familiar paragraph.  
2. **Chunk the anxiety** ‚Äì notice the physical sensations, label them (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling tight in my chest‚Äù), and then let them pass while you keep your focus on the task.  
3. **Reward yourself** ‚Äì you already gave yourself a gold badge; keep celebrating each small step (a favorite snack, a short walk, whatever feels good).

Remember, every call you make builds a little more confidence. Keep dialing‚Äîyour future self will thank you! üôå","

Reality is that I get so anxious around other people and so overwhelmed in different situations that my brain literally shuts off. 



It's like when you have stage fright and forget all your lines, even though you had them all memorized the night before. That's my brain 24/7.

It‚Äôs pretty common; we all want to make a good impression, so we subconsciously mute the parts of ourselves we think might be ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù

A couple of things that helped me:  

1. **Treat the first few minutes as a warm‚Äëup, not a performance.** Focus on listening and asking genuine questions rather than trying to be funny right away. Curiosity is contagious and takes the pressure off you.  

2. **Give yourself a tiny ‚Äúpermission slip.‚Äù** Decide beforehand that you‚Äôll drop one piece of your usual slang or share one goofy anecdote. It‚Äôs a small, manageable way to let your personality peek through.  

3. **Notice the laughter cue.** If you‚Äôre over‚Äëlaughing, pause, breathe, and let the moment settle ‚Äì you‚Äôll sound more relaxed and authentic.

Remember, most people are more forgiving than we assume. The more you practice letting a little of the real you slip out, the easier it gets. Keep at it; you‚Äôve got this!","

You are your own worst critic!",1636,54,1604202882,"My brain: ""But what if this time they are!""",167,kpsdarlin,"Thank you!

It‚Äôs crazy how we can spend minutes replaying every perceived flaw, while the people around us are barely noticing the color of our shirt.  

A couple things that have helped me quiet that inner critic:  

1. **Catch the thought, then flip it.** When you notice ‚ÄúMy skin looks terrible,‚Äù pause, label it as a thought, and replace it with a neutral fact (‚ÄúI‚Äôm noticing my skin, that‚Äôs all‚Äù).  
2. **Shift focus outward.** Give yourself a tiny mission‚Äî‚Äãnotice one thing you like about someone else‚Äôs outfit or smile. Turning attention away from yourself reduces the ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù feeling.  
3. **Practice a quick self‚Äëcompassion check.** Imagine a friend saying the same thing you‚Äôre thinking; would you be that harsh? Speak to yourself with the same kindness.  

Remember, the brain is wired to over‚Äëmonitor itself, but you can train it to relax. You‚Äôve got this.","

A gentle trick that helps many people is to shift the focus from ‚Äúnot wanting tomorrow‚Äù to ‚Äúgiving yourself a small, kind break right now.‚Äù Try a short, low‚Äëstimulus routine before bed: dim the lights, put on a calming playlist or a podcast, and do a simple body‚Äëscan meditation for 5‚Äë10‚ÄØminutes.

If the thoughts keep racing, jot them down on paper‚Äîsometimes putting the worries out of your head and onto a page reduces their power.

A couple things that have helped me break that cycle:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Pause before you speak.** Even a one‚Äësecond ‚Äúhold‚Äù (count to three silently) gives your brain a chance to filter the thought. It feels weird at first, but it becomes a habit.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Practice ‚Äúself‚Äëtalk‚Äù after the fact.** Remind yourself that one awkward moment doesn‚Äôt define your intelligence. Anxiety is a symptom, not a measure of your ability.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Gradual exposure.** Put yourself in low‚Äëstakes conversations where the stakes are tiny (e.g., chatting with a barista). Repeating this builds confidence and weakens the anxiety‚Äëembarrassment feedback loop.

The people laughing aren‚Äôt being cruel (though it hurts), they just assume you missed the joke on purpose.

A couple things that tend to help:

1. **Give yourself a ‚Äúpause‚Äù cue.** When you sense a joke coming, mentally note ‚Äúpause, listen, then respond.‚Äù Even a quick breath can reset the anxiety loop.  
2. **Ask for clarification right away.** ‚ÄúSorry, I missed that‚Äîcould you repeat the key point?‚Äù shows you‚Äôre engaged and avoids the ‚Äúthick‚Äù label.  
3. **Prep before meetings.** If you know a briefing is coming, write down a few bullet points you need to capture; that external list eases the pressure on your brain.

lfmrtn,Anxiety,Anybody else find it suspicious when they‚Äôre NOT anxious,[deleted],My mind instantly goes to all the worst possible scenarios. It‚Äôs like an addiction to overthink and be anxious. Feels odd to feel calm... anyone else?,1527,131,1612820788,I always think if I let myself be calm something bad will happen.,246,MeetStrong,"When I was recovering from depression and anxiety (which I struggled with for the first 25 years of my life) I felt a weird sort of void when I was feeling calm and peaceful. I can go back and look at journal entries from that time and often noted a feeling of ""emptiness"" or ""numbness"" and that I felt like something was ""missing."" -- since that time I have realized how to let go of ideas about how I ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" feel.   


I have found a daily meditation practice and paleo (low carb/whole foods) diet has virtually eliminated this ""empty"" feeling. There is no such thing as empty, there is just calm, and it's okay to be calm. I notice it. I actively try to quiet my mind and explore the calmness. To turn off the voice in my head (release it, let it go), for at least a few minutes at a time. And when I do this (usually through meditation) I often feel like I have had a power nap. I have literally felt a sensation like cool water on my brain, right behind my eyes. It's awesome.",5,Adoniram1733,"I hear you ‚Äì it can feel downright weird when the brain that‚Äôs been on ‚Äúcrank‚Äëup‚Äù mode finally hits the off switch. When you‚Äôve spent years training yourself to spot every possible disaster, calmness can register as a red flag instead of a relief.  

A good first step is to remind yourself that anxiety is a habit, not a permanent state. When you notice the calm, try labeling it‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling calm right now, and that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù You can also give the mind something harmless to focus on (a simple breathing count, a favorite song, or even a quick body‚Äëscan) so it doesn‚Äôt automatically jump to worst‚Äëcase scenarios.  

If the ‚Äúsuspicion‚Äù lingers, consider journaling the moments you‚Äôre calm and noting what you‚Äôre actually doing. Over time you‚Äôll build evidence that peace isn‚Äôt a threat, it‚Äôs just another part of your mental landscape. You‚Äôve got this, and you‚Äôre definitely not alone.","

ms6sy6,Anxiety,My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.,weeblybeebly,"It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",1552,96,1618590368,Wow that is a game changer. I‚Äôve been treating discomfort as the enemy because I didn‚Äôt like it (duh) but the growing pain makes a lot of sense. Growing as a person comes with a cost. Discomfort is a big issue with a good chunk of my anxiety. Thank you for sharing!! I have some thinking to do.,199,secretsmakeX,"When you encounter enemies in a video game it means you're going the right way

Edit: Thinking this has helped me work my way through a lot of uncomfortable situations and relationships. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs resonated with so many people here. Also I stole this from someone on Reddit, I can‚Äôt remember the thread but I‚Äôve been saying this to myself for years.",187,thugnificent856,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from ‚Äì that ‚Äújust‚Äëavoid‚Äëthe‚Äëdiscomfort‚Äù loop can feel like you‚Äôre stuck on a treadmill that never moves you forward. It‚Äôs amazing how powerful that shift in perspective can be, and you‚Äôve already proved it by taking those first steps (even something as simple as answering a call).  

A couple of things that tend to help keep the momentum going:  

1. **Micro‚Äëexposures** ‚Äì pick tiny, low‚Äëstakes ‚Äúdiscomfort‚Äù tasks each day (a quick text, a 5‚Äëminute walk, a brief phone call). The brain starts to rewire the ‚Äúdanger‚Äù signal into ‚Äúmanageable.‚Äù  
2. **Track the wins** ‚Äì jot down the moments you pushed through and how it actually turned out. Seeing the pattern on paper reinforces the new belief that you can handle it.  
3. **Self‚Äëcompassion breaks** ‚Äì when a task feels overwhelming, give yourself permission to pause, breathe, and remind yourself that feeling uneasy is just part of growth, not a failure.

Keep leaning into those little uncomfortable moments; the more you do, the less they‚Äôll feel like obstacles and more like stepping stones. You‚Äôre doing great‚Äîcheering you on from the sidelines!","

czqtqt,Anxiety,Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?,QueenFrankie420,"I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. My stomach will hurt and occasionally I'll get heartburn. Only when I'm highly anxious.

I just wondered if anyone else gets this and can't think of anywhere I'd be more comfortable asking....

Edit - wow, this blew up. I had no idea this was such a common thing!",1424,224,1567631317,100% yes. It's awful. I'm now at the point where if I get a stomach ache for any reason I'm immediately anxious because I'm connecting the fact that anxiety makes me sick. It's a vicious cycle.,249,maggiemoocorgipoo,"Yes! 

Here is a story of me and my anxiety last summer.

I was going through a really stressful time. My sleep was shit and I was sad all the time. I started noticing at some point that my stomach had started hurting all the time. I would get weird different types of stomach pains in different areas of my stomach. I would have diarrhea and nausea literally every morning.

I ended up going to the doctor. A lot. I visited time and time again, always complaining about my stomach. They would run blood tests, take samples of my poop and eventually they even took an ultrasound of my stomach. I was in constant pain all the time. Yet nothing was wrong. 

I even got one of those things with a camera shoved down my throat to check my stomach. Yet again, nothing wrong. I never found any relief in any of the doctors telling me I was ok.

I wasnt ok! I was feeling like shit. I went to the gas station one day to fill up, and there was a restaurant attached, so I decided to order a warm meal. I took one bite and suddenly it felt like my heart was about to burst. I ran to the bathroom and it felt like I couldnt breathe. 

I was having my first panic attack. I didnt know this at the time. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I drove home to see my mother. She was watering some plants and I just told her everything and how scared I was.

She looked at me and said what im experiencing is completely normal. She said everybody goes through anxiety at some part of their life. She then asked me if I was hungry. I said yeah sure.

Just half an hour ago I was sitting in a gas station bathroom crying and feeling like shit, but now I was eating normally. Actually I was eating like a madman lol.

Slowly, but surely I started to understand It was my anxiety causing all this. 

I got even more confirmation the next week when I went to my sisters and her husband. We went fishing and had a couple of beers afterwards. Didnt know I was dealing with anxiety at the time, bad idea to drink alcohol.

We all went to bed and I just couldnt sleep. My heart was beating out of my chest! It felt like my chest was going to explode. I called a taxi and went to the hospital. I complained about shortness of breath and my heart beating like crazy. Got everything checked up and the nurses said there is nothing wrong with me. I chatted with them for a while and one of them asked if I had ever experienced panic attacks. 

At that point I truly started realizing what I was dealing with. OP if you read all the way here, just know that what is happening is normal and part of the process. The pain you feel is real! The tools to combat, however, might be in your mind! 

A year later I‚Äôm still struggling with anxiety but everything regarding gastrointestinal issues I am able to process relatively well.",45,perae,"I totally get it‚Äîmy stomach does a full‚Äëon ‚Äúroller‚Äëcoaster‚Äù whenever my anxiety spikes, too. The gut is basically a second brain, wired to the nervous system, so stress can trigger extra gas, cramps, even urgent bathroom trips or heartburn. You‚Äôre definitely not alone.

A few things that have helped me (and many others) are:

* **Mind‚Äëbody tricks** ‚Äì slow, diaphragmatic breathing or a quick 5‚Äëminute body‚Äërelaxation script can calm the vagus nerve and ease gut tension.  
* **Diet tweaks** ‚Äì keep a simple food log; caffeine, carbonated drinks, and high‚ÄëFODMAP foods often amplify anxiety‚Äërelated symptoms.  
* **Regular movement** ‚Äì gentle walks or yoga after a stressful episode can get the bowels moving in a calmer way.  
* **Professional support** ‚Äì a therapist familiar with CBT or a gastro‚Äëenterologist can give targeted tools and rule out any underlying condition.

Give yourself permission to be kind to your body while you work through the anxiety. It‚Äôs a learning curve, but many people find relief with a blend of these strategies. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone in this.","

u4zd68,Anxiety,"Anyone else have barriers in their mind like ‚Äúonce I solve this, I‚Äôll relax and be happy‚Äù only to have another issue once you take care of the first barrier?",iamqueenlulusendchat,I‚Äôve been dealing with this all of the last year and it‚Äôs so exhausting.,1507,135,1650120537,Yeah I have this with events. ‚ÄòI just need to get past this one‚Äô but it just gets replaced with the next.,264,shopliftinasda,,0,,"I hear you‚Äî‚Äãit‚Äôs like climbing a rope that keeps getting longer the moment you think you‚Äôve reached the top.‚ÄØWhen one ‚Äúto‚Äëdo‚Äù disappears, another pops up, and the relief you were promised feels more like a brief pause before the next sprint.  

A useful way to break the cycle is to shift from ‚Äúfinish line‚Äù thinking to a **process‚Äëfocused** mindset. Pick a small, concrete habit (e.g., a 5‚Äëminute breath break, a nightly ‚Äúwin‚Äëlist‚Äù of what you actually completed) and treat that as the reward itself, not the gateway to the next task. Over time you‚Äôll train your brain to find satisfaction in the act of showing up, not just in crossing a finish line.  

Also, give yourself permission to *just be* for a few minutes each day‚Äîno to‚Äëdo list, no problem solving.

A few things that helped me (and many others) are:

1. **Grounding & ‚Äúbrain breaks.‚Äù** Set a timer for 5‚Äëminute intervals where you focus on your breath, a simple sensory detail, or a short walk. Those micro‚Äëpauses give the nervous system permission to reset.

3. **Tiny, doable goals.** Instead of ‚ÄúI have no motivation,‚Äù pick one tiny action‚Äîlike reading one paragraph of a book or sending a quick text. Success builds momentum and reminds your brain that you‚Äôre still capable.

Now if I get a stomach ache, I ask myself, what am I nervous about?",226,Hannajomac,"I know that feeling all too well ‚Äì anxiety can hijack the gut so hard it actually triggers nausea or even vomiting. Your brain is telling you ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine,‚Äù but the body‚Äôs stress response (fight‚Äëor‚Äëflight) often floods the stomach with acid and slows digestion, which is why you get that sick‚Äëin‚Äëyour‚Äëstomach sensation.

A few things that tend to help:

* **Breathing & grounding** ‚Äì slow, diaphragmatic breaths (4‚Äë4‚Äë6 count) and a quick grounding exercise (e.g., 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory check) can calm the vagus nerve and reduce the queasy feeling.  
* **Progressive muscle relaxation** ‚Äì tense and release muscle groups for 5‚Äì10‚ÄØmin before the anxiety‚Äëtrigger; it eases the physical tension that contributes to nausea.  
* **Mind‚Äëbody tools** ‚Äì short guided meditations or apps like Insight Timer can train your body to stay calmer when anxiety spikes.

flvow6,Anxiety,Does anyone else's stomach gets upset when anxious ?,_andy_7,My stomach always begins to ache when anxious . At times I have to excrete too .

mvjotr,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxious over literally nothing?,artificialn0cturne,"I'm not even worried about anything specifically. It's just a lingering anxiety.

I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given!

jroy1r,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,cry-b4by,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)",1526,101,1605028409,"I absolutely HATE yelling. Like really, really bad. I‚Äôm no sigmund freud but for me it‚Äôs definitely because I grew up in an incredibly shaky household. My family was always fighting, police coming in and out of my house, just overall not fun stuff. So I‚Äôm assuming that has something to do with it for me. Definitely bring this up with your therapist, perhaps they will be able to help that initial trigger, but regardless bringing up any trigger is only going to help you and your therapist work on a treatment plan. If this is your first appointment, try and spend a few minutes and just jot down the things, the moments, and the people that make you anxious. It‚Äôs only going to help. Best wishes and good luck!",180,adolescentd,Do you have ADHD? I have always been anxious and depressed but I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. The psych said my strong aversion to loud noises is from that.,1,xanaxhelps,"I hear you ‚Äì the sound of a raised voice can feel like a physical jolt, even when it isn‚Äôt aimed at you.

Bringing this up at your therapist‚Äôs intake is a great idea.

In the meantime, a few low‚Äëkey coping tools can make the moments less overwhelming:

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?

POST BODY: Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)

A couple of things that tend to help:

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Gradual exposure** ‚Äì gently practice speaking up in low‚Äëstakes settings (small group discussions, online forums) so your brain learns those situations aren‚Äôt actually dangerous.

hpaekj,Anxiety,Does anybody else find the sound of rain soothing?,ChampagneSupernovae,"When it rains (as it is doing so now), I always love to turn off my lights and lie in bed listening to it hit the roof or pavement outside. I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

A couple of things that have helped me break that loop:

1. **Grounding** ‚Äì As soon as the scent hits, name five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, etc. It pulls the brain out of the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù mode.
2. **Re‚Äëframe the cue** ‚Äì Remind yourself, ‚ÄúThis is just toast. My brain is mis‚Äëlabeling it.‚Äù Saying it out loud can weaken the automatic fear response.
3. **Practice exposure** ‚Äì Occasionally sniff toast (or a similar smell) on purpose while you‚Äôre calm, and pair it with a relaxed activity. Over time the brain relearns the neutral meaning.

POST TITLE: With the US election 2 days away, who else is worried about what's to come?

POST BODY: I know politics have gotten super crazy I'm the last few years, so I hope we can have a civil discussion. With the election so close and reading up on the crazy stuff going on, I'm terrified to be living in America. That's so wild and depressing to say! I feel my mental health is getting worse and I just want this to be over. I'm worried that this week will get crazy and there's nothing I can do. It's like reading a history book without knowing the outcome. How is everyone else coping through this week?

Edit: 2 things- thanks to all the replies. I've read each and every single one of them. It's a bit reassuring to see most people with the same views and worries. 
I've also been impressed with the civility in this post. Also gives me a glimmer of hope for our society.

Make sure you vote. Democracy dies if we don't and right now that's more important than ever.

hfk86k,Anxiety,Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?,[deleted],"Seriously, I don‚Äôt understand how people aren‚Äôt absolutely terrified of driving. You‚Äôre inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don‚Äôt hit someone.

A few things that have helped me calm the anxiety:

1. **Practice ‚Äúmental rehearsal.‚Äù** Before you get behind the wheel, picture the route, the spots that usually make you nervous, and how you‚Äôll handle them. Your brain treats it like a drill, which reduces the surprise factor.

2. **Gradual exposure.** Start with short, low‚Äëtraffic trips (like a quick run to the store) and slowly increase distance and complexity. Celebrate each successful drive‚Äîit builds confidence.

3. **Control what you can.** Keep your car well‚Äëmaintained, use cruise control on highways, and give yourself extra following distance. Knowing you‚Äôve minimized mechanical risks eases the mental load.

4. **Mind‚Äëbody tricks.** A few deep breaths or a quick 30‚Äëand‚Äë‚Äëcount before you pull out can lower the adrenaline surge.

If the anxiety feels overwhelming, a therapist who specializes in CBT or exposure therapy can give you tools tailored to driving fears. You‚Äôre definitely not alone,","

Those of us with anxiety and other things like depression and panic ect... it is caused by the inability for our brains to regulate chemical processes. So with anxiety and panic, our Amygdala is pretty fucked up. The amygdala is incharge of regulating norepinephrine ( the stress signal), dopamine, serotonin, Adrenalin and cortisol. When the Amygdala cant regulate properly it either, sends to much or not enough of these chemicals, and it never happens like clock work. One day we will get too much, then the next fived days not enough and the next 4 days not enough and the next too much ect... its not a perfect pattern.. if it was... we would probably be better able to adapt to our ""regular"" cycles.

So With us.. we have to remember and learn about how our unique, malfunctioning brain works.. If you feel on top of the world for a day, after a long haul of feeling like shit, remember that you will experience a crash eventually, But Dont pout about it, its just biology, our brains and bodies are not used to the amount of dopamine and serotonin production that the amygdala is giving off that day or week that we feel on top of the world, This will result in a crash, where we feel tired,and it will probably go back to producing to much cortisol, which is what happens when normal people are tired. Tired people are stressed and depressed. It is an annoying vicious cycle, i do not wish upon anyone, but what really helped me was being able to listen and know my body... 

On those days that you feel high in the sky, observe what is happening, and observe that fact that you are not used to it, so you will crash, and you must enjoy the ride. Be prepared for the next days to come.

It sucks, but it is not a hopeless cause. If you really try, you can help calm the shit out of your own brain. I have done it. I will never be completely cured of  depression or anxiety, Everyone feels anxious  and depressed at times because this is natural, what you want to cure is the anxiety or depression you feel when you cannot think of a reason why. Once you have done that, You can move onto curing more specific things like social anxiety, chronic stress, activities or memories that give you depression or anxiety.

I wont put all of the specifics, because if you want to help yourself you are going to look up each of these things.  ( I am putting the ones that I have tried that worked at the top) Things to help you heal your amygdala are:

atleast 15- 20 minuets of sunlight per day

Meditate and stretch. ( yoga or not stretch your body) 

Diet change ( their are specific foods that do not help and can even cause depression and stress, its not the food specifically that causes it, it is what that food does to the body which domino effects to your brain. You basically have a brain in your stomach, many people call the stomach ""the second brain"" when in fact it should be the first brain, your stomach has a larger neural network then the brains in our head do, so when you are choosing food to eat, remember that what you feed your belly, you are feeding to your brain.)

Good nights sleep

10 min nap in the middle of the day

Water- Drink it, Swim, take baths, showers, put your feet in it or watch it. Water is therapeutic.

Switching up your routine, ( or getting a routine, if you are like me that was not a thing before)

Get a hobby.

Exercise ( I hate working out, but what helped me was at that moment which I started to feel like shit, panic, anxious, depressed, I would walk it out, Even run up and down the stairs, when we are active our brains produce special chemicals that sort of override the stress hormones and lack of serotonin and dopamine) 

Getting a pet and\\or having plants in your house ( again if you like me and have trouble keeping plant alive, choose succulents. Plants bring good chi, especially if you dont go outside very much to be around plants, having them in the place where you are most often helps you ).

The best thing I ever did for myself  to heal Panic disorder and anxiety, that I never thought of until I started Cognitive behavioral Therapy ( on my own, no money required)  was when I learned that I need to insert my self into settings and situations that I would otherwise not, As in do shit that gives me anxiety. For example I am scared to death of heights, So I went free climbing with my boyfriend in a canyon, yes I did cry on the way down, and no I did not look down when I got to the top of the maybe 50 feet we climbed, but there was this weird thing that happened, where I felt like I could do that again, and thinking about what I did didnt bring me anxiety&gt; I repeatedly did this. I have social anxiety, and I inserted my self into social situations, slowly at first, but last weekend I stayed out of my room for an entire party my roomates had, there was NO retreating. I took a job in a city 20 mins away from house, which I have to drive through a snowy canyon to get too... Do I have driving anxiety anymore? Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my last drug I will prescribe you.

Change. Change up your life, like your day to day routine, change stuff. There was a study they did with school kids that showed when the kids change which side of the classroom they sit in every day it helps them learn better, Basically not changing where you sit, creates a sort of comfort and familiarity, lessening attention. When we change up our lives often, we crawl out of the comfort zone, things that were unfamiliar and anxiety ridden before, become more friendly to us. When we change things, we create more energy, we are tired less often, and less fatigue means less depression, less stress, less anxiety. 

Change your life, and you will really change your life. 

Take it slow, remember that you are human and humans are a mystery to this world. We are powerful machines, and Mind over Matter does exist. Do not fall into this preconceived notion that you have a problem that can only be fixed by medications and doctors.. most of the time, that is not true. Take the steps to help your self first, and if you really just cannot do it, then spend the money on a therapist.. But in all honesty, we are our own best therapists.

 ",61,s0nder369thOughts,"I hear you ‚Äì those ‚Äúon‚Äëtop‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëworld‚Äù spikes can feel amazing at first, and then the crash that follows can leave you wondering what you did wrong.‚ÄØYou‚Äôre definitely not alone; many people experience that roller‚Äëcoaster of confidence and low mood, and it can be especially confusing when it seems to come out of nowhere.

It‚Äôs encouraging that you‚Äôve spoken with your university counseling center and got a possible explanation. If bipolar‚ÄØII is part of the picture, a mood stabilizer or therapy (CBT, DBT, psycho‚Äëeducation) can help smooth out the highs and lows. In the meantime, a few practical things that often help:

* **Track your patterns.** A simple mood journal (or an app) can show you triggers, sleep changes, or stressors that precede the spikes.  
* **Stick to a routine.** Consistent sleep, meals, and light exercise can reduce the amplitude of mood swings.

POST TITLE: Anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?

POST BODY: Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. 

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well

You‚Äôre not ‚Äúbroken,‚Äù you‚Äôre just stuck in a habit loop where anxiety has become the default mode of thinking.

One practical trick is to give the worry a ‚Äútime‚Äëslot.‚Äù When something pops up, write it down and tell yourself you‚Äôll revisit it in, say, 30‚ÄØminutes. Use that waiting: do a grounding exercise, a short walk, or a breathing box (4‚Äë4‚Äë4‚Äë4). When the timer‚Äôs up, you can choose to address it or let it go. Over time you train the brain that worries don‚Äôt need immediate action.

Also, try building small ‚Äúworry‚Äëfree‚Äù rituals ‚Äì a cup of tea, a favorite song, or a quick sketch. Consistently pairing those moments with calm can slowly overwrite the constant‚Äëalert state. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and every tiny pause is a win. Hang in there!","

hd78e8,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù their anxiety disorder?,[deleted],"As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i‚Äôve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues.

A few things that have helped people in similar spots:

1. **Name the feelings** ‚Äì Write down specific moments that trigger anger or anxiety. Seeing them on paper can separate the emotion from the person, making it easier to work with.  
2. **Set boundaries** ‚Äì Even if you can‚Äôt change your mom‚Äôs behavior, you can decide what you‚Äôll tolerate now (e.g., limiting criticism, choosing topics you won‚Äôt discuss the past).  
3. **Therapy / CBT** ‚Äì A therapist can give you tools to re‚Äëframe those old messages and reduce the anxiety loop.  
4. **Self‚Äëcompassion** ‚Äì Remind yourself that you‚Äôre learning to unlearn the internalized criticism; it‚Äôs okay to feel upset while also being grateful for the things they did provide.

A practical step is to set low‚Äëstakes boundaries that protect you without feeling like you‚Äôre performing for them. For example, if a panic attack starts, you might excuse yourself to the restroom or use a ‚Äúquick break‚Äù script (‚ÄúI need a moment, I‚Äôll be right back‚Äù). That gives you space to self‚Äësoothe while signaling to others that you‚Äôre managing the situation responsibly.  

At the same time, keep sharing your experience with the people who are willing to listen‚Äîthose allies gradually shift the culture. It‚Äôs okay to ask for a brief reassurance or a calming cue; you‚Äôre not asking for special treatment, just the same courtesy you‚Äôd extend to any health issue.

c5uovo,Anxiety,"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!",slutzombie,"I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I‚Äôm really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I‚Äôd have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

I‚Äôm glad you gave yourself a chance instead of the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù script that usually runs in our heads.  

A couple of things that might help keep this momentum going:  

1. **Debrief quickly** ‚Äì jot down what went well (your German pronunciation, the calm answers) and one tiny tweak you‚Äôd like for next time. Seeing the wins on paper reinforces them.  
2. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì before future interviews try the 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath or the ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù sensory exercise; they‚Äôre quick enough to use even if you feel a spike.  
3. **Celebrate the effort** ‚Äì the fact you showed up is already a win. Whether you get the job or not, you‚Äôve proven you can sit with the discomfort and still perform.

Good luck ‚Äì I‚Äôm rooting for you, and whatever the outcome, you‚Äôve earned a serious confidence boost! üéâ","

Some mornings feel like climbing a mountain with a backpack full of rocks, and just getting out of bed can feel like a victory in itself. It‚Äôs okay to be scared or anxious‚Äîthose feelings are part of the human experience, not a sign that you‚Äôre failing.

One thing that‚Äôs helped many people is breaking the day into tiny, doable steps. Instead of ‚ÄúI have to survive the whole day,‚Äù try ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get up, splash water on the face, and sit for five minutes with a cup of tea.‚Äù Those micro‚Äëwins build momentum without overwhelming you.

Also, consider giving yourself permission to reach out‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a trusted friend, a therapist, or an online community like this one. Talking about the weight you‚Äôre carrying can lighten it, and you don‚Äôt have to do it all alone.

Remember, you‚Äôre already doing the hardest part: showing up. Keep being kind to yourself, celebrate the small victories, and let the rest unfold at its own pace. You‚Äôve got this.","

Give yourself permission to grieve in whatever way feels right, whether that‚Äôs sitting with the memories, talking to a sibling, or simply letting the tears come.

kssgs6,Anxiety,Do you think it's fair to say the past year has been traumatic?,tomorrowistomato,"I feel permanently changed by everything that's happened this past year. I am exhausted. I feel bitter and angry and sad. I have never hated people the way I do now. There are times that I feel like going outside and just screaming at the sky until I can't anymore. And I feel gaslit by the people around me who want to pretend that nothing is wrong. 

I'm very lucky that the events of this year haven't had a huge direct impact on me - I have a job and a place to live, my loved ones are alive. But it feels like everything else is just a giant fucking nightmare. All I want to do is sleep and pretend I don't exist.

I‚Äôve been having random ‚Äúbreakdowns‚Äù where I just burst into tears. I don‚Äôt think the scope of the past year has fully sunk in for me yet.

Today was the worst day of the pandemic yet for my area.,208,MandyPandyxox,,0,,"I hear you, and it sounds like you‚Äôve been carrying a weight that most people can‚Äôt even see.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs completely understandable to feel exhausted, angry, and bitter when the world feels like it‚Äôs spiraling while you‚Äôre forced to keep a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù front for work and family. That dissonance ‚Äì the gap between what you‚Äôre experiencing internally and what others act like they‚Äôre experiencing ‚Äì can feel downright gaslighting.

First, give yourself permission to *feel* those emotions without judgment. Journaling, a therapist, or even a trusted friend who can sit with you in silence can help you process rather than bottle it up. Small, concrete self‚Äëcare actions (a short walk, a favorite playlist, a 10‚Äëminute ‚Äúreset‚Äù meditation) can create tiny islands of relief in the middle of the storm.

It‚Äôs also okay to set boundaries with people who minimize the situation. You don‚Äôt have to explain everything; simply saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in a place to talk right now,‚Äù is enough. Remember, healing isn‚Äôt a linear ‚Äúgetting back to normal‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs learning to live with the aftermath and finding new ways to feel safe and hopeful. You‚Äôre not alone in this","

971qny,Anxiety,I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,saberToothedCat,"SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

A couple of things to keep in mind moving forward:  

1. **Separate the act from the outcome.** You succeeded in taking the risk; the response (she has a¬†boyfriend) is just information, not a judgment of you.  

2. **Use the experience as data.** You now know you can handle that uncomfortable moment, so future ‚Äúcold‚Äëcalls‚Äù will feel a lot easier.  

3. **Stay respectful of boundaries.** If she‚Äôs taken, keep it friendly and move on‚Äîthere are plenty of other people who‚Äôll be open to getting to know you.

Keep leaning into those little exposures; they‚Äôll keep building confidence, one brave step at a time. üöÄ","

It‚Äôs constant off-and-on problems with cramping, gas, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes outright pain. Sometimes I‚Äôll get a jolt of nerves and the suddenly I have horrible stomach pain. Other times I just feel mildly sick. It doesn‚Äôt even matter what I eat, nothing seems to help. It can be really discouraging and debilitating. When my anxiety is higher, it always makes these problems WAY worse. Then the vicious cycle begins and it gives me MORE anxiety. 

Am I alone in this? I hate anxiety!",1319,181,1614870093,"Nausea and other digestive issues are very, very normal symptoms of anxiety. 

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection

I had constant nausea for sixteen years - always queasy at a minimum, often developing to the point of vomiting...sometimes for hours on end. It's awful. Thankfully it was the first symptom to disappear when I started my SSRI but for like half my life, man...and it often resembled the stomach flu, just endless hours in the bathroom in the middle of the night anxious to the point of sickness. Especially during finals in school, the week before and the week of. Not conducive towards being a productive human being. I once had to bail on most of my accounting final because the professor banned us from leaving the room for any reason and I suddenly *had* to go - I threw the exam on her desk and bolted from the room as fast as I could, barely made it in time. I've puked in my fair share of trash cans and bushes.

Peppermint or ginger tea can help. Anxious nausea is typically due to an overproduction of acid so antacids can help. For a portable option you can try Seabands, they're marketed for motion sickness but work pretty well for anxious nausea. And Tummydrops are good to keep in your pocket at all times - they come in ten flavors at varying intensities, you can get them on Amazon.",131,larki18,Yep.

It sucks.,7,nomotaco,"I hear you ‚Äì it can feel like your gut is on a roller‚Äëcoaster that never stops.‚ÄØThe brain‚Äëgut connection is real: anxiety triggers the fight‚Äëor‚Äëlike response, releasing stress hormones that crank up gut motility, increase acid, and make the lining more sensitive. If you already have a family history of IBS, that ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù sensitivity is there, and anxiety just turns the volume up.

A few things that tend to help break the cycle:

1. **Mind‚Äëbody tools** ‚Äì short, daily practices like diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or a 5‚Äëminute guided meditation can blunt the spike when you feel a ‚Äújolt.‚Äù Apps such as Insight Timer or Calm have quick anxiety‚Äërelief sessions.

2. **Gentle movement** ‚Äì light walking, yoga, or even stretching after meals can stimulate healthy peristalsis and reduce bloating.

3. **Dietary tweaks** ‚Äì keep a simple food‚Äësymptom journal (no fancy apps needed). Often it‚Äôs not the food itself but timing, portion size, or high‚ÄëFODMAP items that amplify stress‚Äërelated symptoms.

If you want to make future trips even smoother, try a few small steps: familiarize yourself with the basic menu (e.g., ‚Äútall drip coffee‚Äù or ‚Äúgrande latte‚Äù) before you go, or even look up the app and pre‚Äëorder.

n4ca68,Anxiety,"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!",Two-Tailed-Fox,"(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",1416,78,1620089958,"A note to those worried.

I have the same phobia but I'm gonna get the covid vaxx no matter what.

For the second shot, you might try a few things that helped you the first time:  
- **Grounding** ‚Äì keep your eyes on a single tile (or a picture on the wall) and silently name the colors, shapes, etc. It distracts the brain from the needle.  
- **Controlled breathing** ‚Äì inhale for 4‚ÄØseconds, hold 2, exhale 6; a slow rhythm can curb the panic surge.  
- **Topical numbing** ‚Äì a lidocaine patch or spray applied 30‚ÄØminutes before can dull the sting.

One trick that helps me is to reframe leisure as *investment* in yourself, not waste.

Another angle: pick one small skill you genuinely like and set a tiny, concrete goal (like ‚Äúlearn one chord on guitar‚Äù or ‚Äúdraw one character this week‚Äù). The progress you see will quiet the ‚ÄúI should be better at something else‚Äù narrative.  

Remember, you don‚Äôt need to love everything; having a few things that *feel* good enough is perfectly fine. Be kind to yourself‚Äîyou‚Äôre already doing the hard work of noticing the anxiety, and that‚Äôs a big step.","

POST TITLE: Anyone else have a weird fear of being seen or heard doing anything, especially in your own household?

POST BODY: I live with my mother and her friend (not in the greatest relations with both) and my room just so happens to double as a storage for their own things, so there's always someone walking in and out of here without knocking, even. For some inexplicable reason I just hate being seen doing something or being heard doing absolutely anything, be it listening to music out loud or watching a video. It's not like any of it is inherently embarrassing either, which makes it very hard for me to justify acquiring muscle memory for Win + L / Win + D and waiting until the person walks out. Most of the time I'd stay up in the night just so I can't be bothered, but every little sound outside my room stops me for a solid minute before I go back to what I was doing. Anyone else feeling something similar and how do you approach dealing with it?

Like once a month is probably pretty normal. If you spend almost every night doing this though, that is something to work on. It sounds like you struggle with embarrassment or fear of judgement. I used to be really bad about it, like if I said something that came across stupid or insensitive, I would apologize to that person, but I didn't forgive myself for it. I just replayed in my head how dumb it was. 

An old co-worker gave me the best advice about this. She said, no one is paying that much attention to you. It sounded mean at first but what she meant was, everyone else is so in their own head and worried about themselves that they probably will forget the dumb thing you said or did. 

It's like when you are nervous to give a speech in class. You are so afraid of messing up or everyone looking at you, but in reality, everyone else in the class is focused on being nervous themselves.

A few things that tend to help:

* **Name the loop.** When you notice the replay starting, mentally label it ‚Äúrumination‚Äù and gently shift your focus to something concrete (a breathing count, a body‚Äëscan, or a simple task).

Doesn‚Äôt help that the receptionists always ask what the problem is to see if you‚Äôre even worthy of talking to a doctor!,94,[deleted],"First of all, huge congratulations on taking that step‚Äîyou‚Äôve already shown a lot of‚ÄØmind‚Äëset and courage just by getting to the doctor. It‚Äôs completely normal to feel a mix of relief, hope, and maybe a little nervousness about the meds; they‚Äôre just one tool in a bigger toolbox that will help you reclaim the life you want to live.

A couple things that tend to help many people after the first appointment:

1. **Give it time** ‚Äì most meds need a few weeks to settle in, and the dosage may be tweaked. Keep a simple journal of how you feel day‚Äëto‚Äëday; it‚Äôs useful for you and your prescriber.  
2. **Add small habits** ‚Äì gentle movement (a short walk, yoga), regular sleep, and brief mindfulness practices can boost the medication‚Äôs effect.  
3. **Stay connected** ‚Äì lean on friends, family, or a support group (online or in‚Äëperson). Sharing what you‚Äôre feeling, even the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù days, prevents isolation.

If you ever feel side‚Äëeffects are too intense or you‚Äôre unsure about anything, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach back out to your doctor‚Äîthey‚Äôre there to help you find the right balance. Keep celebrating each little win; you‚Äôre already moving","

If the anxiety spikes around not knowing the rules, write down the basics beforehand so you have a fallback.

A few things that have helped me (and many others) are:

1. **Pause and breathe** ‚Äì before you respond, take a slow, silent breath. Even a half‚Äësecond pause can calm the nervous system and give you space to choose your words.  
2. **Practice ‚Äúactive listening.‚Äù** Focus on truly hearing the other person instead of planning your reply. Nod, make brief ‚Äúmm‚Äëhmm‚Äù sounds, and let them finish; you‚Äôll find the urge to jump in fades.  
3. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì keep a glass of water nearby or lightly press your fingertips together; the physical sensation redirects excess energy.  

If you can, try low‚Äëstakes conversations (e.g., with a close friend) and deliberately slow your speech. Over time the brain learns a new rhythm, and the weird, rushed chats start to smooth out. You‚Äôre not alone, and it‚Äôs totally possible","

n8c6tk,Anxiety,A mental trick that has greatly helped me overcome anxiety.,whatevergotlaid,"Anxiety is a mental behavior. Often a worrying about the future, solving problems, ruminating about the past, overly caring what others think about you, hyper analyzing your own words or actions, etc..

And when these patterns and behaviors are noticed they are often excited by another behavior: us resisting them, or trying to hide them.

Ive found it incredibally effective to name these behaviors as if they were characters in your head, And when they appear, simply say hello to them. Maybe thank them for trying to keep you safe, and thats it. In time, they will relax, but this cant be your goal. Acceptance of them must be your goal.

Here are some of my characters:
""The reherses future conversations guy""

""The replays past social interactions guy""

""The finds reasons to avoid things guy""

""The narrator""

""The overanalyzing my owns words as i speak guy""

""The worried that future events wont happen the way I want them to guy""

""The trying to stop current behavior guy""

for25u,Anxiety,Life Pro Tip: Do NOT constantly be watching the news on this stuff,[deleted],"Keep informed on key updates and take the medical advice seriously (distancing, washing hands, etc). 

But trust me, do NOT be watching the news 24/7, googling it all the time and scrolling World News subreddit constantly for updates. **This will destroy your mental health.**

People who don't have anxiety are panicking, so what the hell do you think those with anxiety will behave like?

It really does make a difference.",1342,112,1585145959,"Amen to that. I keep my focus local, so I know what I'm supposed to be doing in my city/surrounding region.

It‚Äôs easy to convince yourself that you‚Äôre staying ‚Äúinformed,‚Äù but the constant flood of doom can quickly turn into a anxiety loop.  

A good middle ground is to set intentional check‚Äëins: pick one reliable source, limit yourself to a 10‚Äëminute window once or twice a day, and then deliberately shift focus to something that grounds you (a walk, a hobby, a call with a friend). Turning off push notifications and muting the news feed can be a lifesaver, too.

igkk32,Anxiety,I‚Äôm so worried about wasting my time that I wind up wasting my time,TehJezzy,"It sucks. I‚Äôm sure all of us have these days where we have a whole list of goals we want to accomplish but our time anxiety gets the best of us. 

I‚Äôve tried doing the small goals approach, but I wind up feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. My lack of self motivation is so atrocious it‚Äôs a miracle I can wake up at normal times.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues? It sucks because I want to continue with my future but my complacency from anxiety and depression just wraps itself around me.",1403,48,1598387880,"So I""m still working on this, and I don't have a solid solution yet, but I can try to share what's worked for me. 

It all comes down to harm reduction and countering shame. I've been working (with the help of my therapist) on positive self-talk and not falling into the trap of shaming myself for ""wasting time"" because shame is not a motivator. It just makes me feel worse and I go online to avoid the negative feelings and the spiral intensifies. 

I've instead been focusing on harm reduction. I can't just stop ""wasting time"" all at once, but I can get better at focusing on the task at hand. I can try to push myself a little bit more each time and then acknowledge that. So instead of the negative self-talk of ""oh no you wasted 30 minutes"" it could be ""you spent only 30 minutes on Reddit this time as opposed to 45 and then you got focused again. How can we make that time to focus shorter?"" I'm been working on using timers for work and for breaks and trying not to be angry at myself when I forget to set them or follow them. 

It all boils down to self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself. And remember one more important detail: internalized capitalism is the worst. You have value irrespective of what you accomplish. You are not worthless because you haven't produced what you want or feel like you need to produce. You are not a robot and you are going to have days when you feel really productive and days when you need to just curl up into a ball and wait for the day to go by. What's important is to be able to tell the difference between the two.",124,Emperor_Pengwing,,0,,"I hear you ‚Äì that loop of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll waste time, so I end up wasting it‚Äù is a nightmare many of us get stuck in, especially when anxiety and depression are pulling the rug out from under you.  

A trick that‚Äôs helped me is to **re‚Äëframe ‚Äúsmall goals‚Äù as ‚Äúminimum viable actions.‚Äù** Pick one thing that takes 5‚Äë10‚ÄØminutes (e.g., open a document, write one sentence, set a timer for a quick walk). Do it, then *allow* yourself to stop. The brain loves completion, and checking even a tiny box can break the paralysis.  

Pair that with a loose schedule: block out a few 25‚Äëminute ‚Äúfocus windows‚Äù (Pomodoro style) and schedule ‚Äúnothing‚Äù time afterward so you don‚Äôt feel guilty if you don‚Äôt be‚Äëproductively fill every minute.

gmezo7,Anxiety,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?",[deleted],"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

jcwbws,Anxiety,I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF,State-City,"I‚Äôm a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

Edit: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE KIND WORDS! This means so much to me. My goal was to share my experience and maybe it could help others. You guys are all so kind :)",1357,87,1602945834,GOOD JOB !! c:&lt;,50,Shnokio,GOOD JOB !! c:&lt;,50,Shnokio,"Hey, first off ‚Äì huge congratulations on this milestone. I know how terrifying it can feel to sit in the car, let alone step out and walk alone, so give yourself credit for every tiny victory.  

What you‚Äôve built ‚Äì the routine of driving, journaling, meditating, and just showing up ‚Äì is exactly the kind of ‚Äúmicro‚Äëwins‚Äù that rewires anxiety over time. If you ever hit a rough patch, try breaking the walk into even smaller chunks (e.g., walk to the first bench, then back, then a little farther) and celebrate each segment.  

Keeping a *flexible* journal can also help: note not just what went well but what felt scary and how you handled it; later you‚Äôll see patterns and evidence of growth. And if you haven‚Äôt already, consider pairing this self‚Äëwork with a therapist or support group ‚Äì they can give you tools and a safety net when anxiety spikes.  

You‚Äôre proving to yourself that you‚Äôre capable of more than the anxiety says, and that‚Äôs powerful. Keep taking those baby steps; the path ahead will keep widening. üå±","

While we can‚Äôt magically erase it, there are tools that can shrink its grip dramatically.

Even small lifestyle tweaks‚Äîconsistent sleep, limiting caffeine, and gentle movement like walking or yoga‚Äîcan lower baseline anxiety over time.  

If you haven‚Äôt already, consider reaching out to a mental‚Äëhealth professional; a good therapist can help you build a personalized ‚Äúanxiety‚Äëmanagement toolbox.‚Äù You deserve peace, and it‚Äôs possible to get there step by step. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone.","

Sorry for the rambling to whoever actually read this.

The good news is you already have the biggest clue: the ‚Äúsnide comments‚Äù weren‚Äôt aimed at you personally, they‚Äôre just people venting about the situation.  

When the replay loop starts, try a quick grounding trick: name five things you can see, four you can hear, three you can touch, etc. It pulls you out of the mental loop and back into the present. Then give yourself permission to be imperfect ‚Äì everyone says something awkward sometimes.  

If the memory keeps nagging, jot down a short ‚Äúwhat I learned‚Äù note. Turning the cringe into a concrete takeaway can stop the rumination and give you a sense of progress instead of shame. You‚Äôve already moved past it, so be kind to yourself. You‚Äôve got this!","

azrmao,Anxiety,I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,ThomasDHL,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

A few things that might help moving forward:

1. **Ask for proper training or a cheat‚Äësheet.** Most employers will give new cashiers a quick rundown; if they didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs okay to request it before you start again.  
2. **Talk to your manager (or HR) about accommodations.** With an anxiety disorder you can request a quieter shift, a mentor, or a brief ‚Äúbreak‚Äëroom‚Äù spot when you feel a panic coming on.  
3. **(If you feel comfortable)** let your parents know what happened ‚Äì they‚Äôll likely be more supportive than you expect once they","

1. **Scheduled ‚Äúworry time.‚Äù** Set a 10‚Äë15‚ÄØminute slot each day (maybe after dinner). When a thought pops up outside that window, write it down and tell yourself you‚Äôll revisit it later. Over time the brain learns it can ‚Äústore‚Äù the worry instead of replaying it constantly.

dm63gs,Anxiety,Anyone else get random cringe flashbacks?,[deleted],"I keep getting overwhelmed with thoughts of embarrassing things I did like 5 years ago.

I start screaming &amp; cursing :) .",62,M313M313,"I hear you ‚Äì those ‚Äúcringe‚Äëflashback‚Äù moments have a way of popping up out of nowhere and making us feel like we‚Äôre stuck in a never‚Äëending highlight reel of our own awkwardness. First, know you‚Äôre not alone; most of us have a mental ‚Äúblooper reel‚Äù that gets replayed when we‚Äôre stressed or tired.

A few things that have helped me:

1. **Label the feeling.** When the memory shows up, silently say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a cringe flashback,‚Äù and remind yourself it‚Äôs just a thought, not a current reality. Naming it can reduce its power.  
2. **Ground yourself.** Focus on your breath, the chair you‚Äôre sitting in, or the sounds around you for 30 seconds. It pulls you back to the present moment.  
3. **Re‚Äëframe the story.** Ask, ‚ÄúWhat did I learn from that?‚Äù Most of those moments are evidence that I‚Äôve grown since then.  

If the anxiety feels overwhelming or persistent, consider chatting with a therapist ‚Äì they can give you tools to quiet the replay button. You‚Äôve already survived those moments, and you‚Äôre doing fine now. Hang in there!","

* **Keep your coping toolbox handy** for any moments when the healing process (or the emotions it brings up) feels overwhelming.

Tiny, low‚Äëstakes practice (reading a paragraph to yourself, or recording a short voice memo) can give you that rehearsal you craved without the pressure of an audience.

If the anxiety feels overwhelming, consider a quick grounding technique (5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 senses) right before you have to speak, or even a brief chat with a therapist who can teach you CBT tools. You‚Äôre not alone ‚Äì a lot of us have that same early‚Äëschool trigger, and with a bit of intentional practice you can soften its grip.","

euub8p,Anxiety,This might be a silly thing for some people but I made a phone call!!!,bansheey,I have extreme anxiety with the phone. I don't know but it stresses me out. I got a call from my doctor and let it go to voicemail as usual. But I said fuck it. Practiced what I was going to say a million times and called back. I was shaking the whole time but I did it and I'm really proud of myself. I'm slowly exposing myself to social things and this was the first step!,1296,114,1580158748,"I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm the only one that struggles as bad as I do about phone calls. I definitely feel your pain there.

Good job!",124,lookingup9,Omg I totally get it!!! I barely even call my own mother. Good job!,3,Everilda,"First of all, huge kudos to you‚Äîpicking up the phone when it feels like a panic button is a massive step. I totally get how a simple ring can feel like a mountain of anxiety; I‚Äôve been there too, and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsilly‚Äù at all.  

A few things that might help keep the momentum going:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Chunk it down** ‚Äì treat each call as a tiny experiment. Write a short script (just the opening line and a quick closing) and keep it visible while you dial.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Reward yourself** ‚Äì after the call, do something pleasant (a favorite snack, a short walk, a quick episode). Your brain starts linking phone calls with positive outcomes.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Gradual exposure** ‚Äì schedule brief, low‚Äëstakes calls (checking in with a friend, ordering takeout) before tackling bigger ones.  

Remember, shaking hands are just adrenaline, not a sign of failure. Every ring you answer builds a new neural pathway, and you‚Äôre already rewiring it. Keep at it‚Äîyou‚Äôve proven you can do it, and the next call will feel a little easier. üåü","

A few things that have helped me (and many others) are:

1. **Give the day a loose ‚Äúanchor.‚Äù** Pick one tiny, low‚Äëstakes activity you *must* do ‚Äì a short walk, a favorite song, or even 5‚ÄØminutes of tea. It creates a gentle structure without feeling like a to‚Äëdo list.

2. **Set a ‚Äúworry window.‚Äù** Allow yourself 10‚Äì15‚ÄØminutes to write down every anxious thought, then close the notebook and promise yourself you‚Äôll revisit it later. This can stop thoughts from hijacking the whole day.

3. **Break the ‚Äúrelax‚Äëor‚Äëproductivity‚Äù binary.** Choose one ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù task that also gives a tiny sense of accomplishment (e, like tidying a single drawer or cooking a simple meal). It satisfies the guilt‚Äëmonster while still feeling restorative.","

I'm taking online classes for a ""safer"" career, living with my mom. I let my fear freeze me. It happens on a momentary scale like when I can't react and get in a car wreck. But I realized it's on a large, life scale. I'm too scared to move away. Too scared when I try to go on a date with a girl. Too scared of reality so I dissociate and run away with TV or games (used to be drugs and liquor). I'm just too afraid of everything. On lots of meds, but they don't help like they did at first. It doesn't get better, the future only gets worse as old people die and leave, and no new people come in. I know that's distorted thinking, but, I don't know.

The good news is that anxiety isn‚Äôt a permanent wall‚Äîit‚Äôs a habit you can start loosening, one small step at a time.

Try picking one tiny thing that scares you just a notch (maybe a short video call, a new hobby, or a short walk somewhere unfamiliar). Do it, then give yourself credit‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØeven the effort counts. Over time, gradually increase the challenge; the brain learns that the feared outcome rarely happens.

Consider a therapist or a CBT‚Äëbased app that helps you label the thoughts that keep you in the comfort zone and replace them with realistic alternatives. Journaling ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù scenarios can also expose how exaggerated the fear often is.

Remember, progress isn‚Äôt linear. Celebrate the micro‚Äëwins, be kind to yourself when you slip, and keep reminding yourself that the ‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù feels","

bd4pu0,Anxiety,Does anyone else think up scenarios of how things will play out and get extremely worked up and anxious about it?,ConventionalizedSoy,Any help or advice would be great,1281,110,1555260526,‚ÄúWe suffer more in imagination than in reality.‚Äù  is a great quote I‚Äôm trying to be more mindful of.,182,OhhLawd,"All the time. Last year when my anxiety went through the roof, and depression took a hold of me (I still have depression, but much much less than last year), I had to plan out everything from getting out of my apartment to which bus I was going to take to go to college to what streets I would walk on. It was horrible. I still plan out a lot of things though. For example, tomorrow I'm planning on going to Starbucks after college to grab a coffee and read a book. 

When I get worked up on whether I'll be able to make it to a certain place I try to relax and have deep a breath. I usually head out a while early just so I have peace of mind that I'll get there on time.

If you want to talk about it privately you can private message me :)",13,Mr_Phantoms,"I totally get it‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone in the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù spiral. Our brains love to run simulations, and when anxiety shows up it can turn those harmless day‚Äëdreams into full‚Äëblown catastrophes. A couple things that have helped me (and many others) are:

1. **Name the scenario, then set a timer.** Write down the worst‚Äëcase picture, give yourself a 5‚Äëminute ‚Äúworry window,‚Äù and when the timer‚Äôs up deliberately shift your focus. It trains the mind to treat the thought as a temporary event, not a permanent reality.

2. **Ground yourself in the present.** The 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory technique (notice 5 things you see, ¬†4 you can touch, etc.) pulls you out of the mental replay and back into what‚Äôs actually happening right now.

3. **Challenge the assumptions.** Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat evidence do I have that this will actually happen?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most likely outcome?‚Äù Often the odds are far less dire than the story your brain is writing.

4. **Talk it out.** Sharing the scenario with a trusted friend can deflate its power; they‚Äôll often point out blind spots you missed.

Our minds are wired to assume the worst, so the phrase can trigger that stomach‚Äëdrop you described, even when the ‚Äúnews‚Äù turns out to be something as harmless as a missing spice.

One: pause the automatic cascade. When you hear the words, take a breath and remind yourself that you don‚Äôt yet know the content. A simple ‚ÄúOkay, tell me‚Äù can give you a moment to reset.

Two: practice a ‚Äúneutral‚Äëresponse‚Äù habit. Instead of bracing for disaster, you might say, ‚ÄúSure, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù and let the information speak for itself. Over time your brain learns that not every ‚Äúbad news‚Äù is catastrophic.

Three: if the phrase itself is too triggering, it‚Äôs okay to let close friends know. A gentle ‚ÄúCould we just say ‚Äòsomething to share‚Äô instead? It helps me stay calm.‚Äù can save both of you unnecessary stress.

I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently.

For the studying part, break it into bite‚Äësized chunks (20‚Äë30‚ÄØmin) with short breaks. Even a little progress beats staring, and those breaks are perfect moments to cue a short walk, stretch, or a quick playlist change so you don‚Äôt get stuck in a spiral of worry.

acpyz0,Anxiety,"This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.",vapeboy1996,"I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, and I failed at times but didn‚Äôt stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you.

Even a short, 30‚Äësecond grounding exercise can drop cortisol spikes enough to keep you functional.  

Also, don‚Äôt forget to celebrate those wins ‚Äì tell yourself, ‚ÄúI survived that, I can handle the next.‚Äù Ongoing therapy and medication are just tools, not signs of weakness. Keep leaning on your support network, and keep paying it forward like you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre proof that progress is possible, and that‚Äôs huge motivation for anyone still stuck in the darkness. Stay safe and congrats on the EMT path!","

POST TITLE: This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.

POST BODY: I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, and I failed at times but didn‚Äôt stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone!

fbq6n2,Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),berghain_s_1993,"Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?",1300,78,1583044265,"Very much struggling with this now. I spend all day at home studying, but when I get invited out, I just think about how nice it would be to stay home. Social interactions are exhausting",123,[deleted],"I have this same problem. I am definitely a homebody but lately I have just been spending too much time at home and am starting to feel a bit lonely. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I am super paranoid about this virus going around so I‚Äôm even more reluctant to stay home. BUT, I have just been trying to do 1-2 small things every today. Like today I took my dogs on a nice walk and cleaned my room. Not huge tasks but I am proud I at least did something productive :-) I say just do some small things every day. They will build up. Also, I think we are all so hard on ourselves about this kind of stuff. We don‚Äôt need to be super busy all the time. It‚Äôs ok to just take it easy (in moderation of course).",12,theverticalgiraffe,"I hear you. Growing up in a household where ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù felt like a chore can plant a deep‚Äëseated belief that socialising is always a burden, and that belief can stick around long after the original situation is gone.

Try breaking the cycle into tiny, doable pieces.‚ÄØInstead of ‚ÄúI have to leave the house today,‚Äù set a micro‚Äëgoal like ‚Äúput on shoes and step outside for 5‚ÄØminutes, even if I just stand on the balcony.‚Äù‚ÄØPair it with something pleasant‚Äîa favorite coffee, a short walk to a park you like, or a quick run to the mailbox. Celebrate the small win, then gradually extend the time.

It can also help to schedule ‚Äúsocial slots‚Äù in a low‚Äëpressure way: a brief video call, a coffee with one friend, or a community class that focuses on a hobby rather than pure chit‚Äë","

lhv5i1,Anxiety,Does anyone else always think they've done something wrong?,Beanboiproductions,"Hi all. I just wanted to vent a little here. When it comes to messaging, I always feel like I've done something to offend my friends or something. Like, if they dont respond to my messages after a while, I start to feel like I did something wrong and now they hate me. Or whenever I call and they dont answer, I feel like they dont want to talk to me anymore. The obvious and logical answer is that they're busy, but anxiety doesn't give a fuck about logic. Right now, one of my friends hasn't messaged me back in about a week, and my anxiety just tells me stuff like, ""What if they're not busy and just ignoring me because they hate me."" That's my biggest anxiety problem right now. And then I start to get worried that I'm too clingy and that makes my anxiety worse, making me hate everything. Does anyone else get this, and if so, how do I fix it?",1258,119,1613078581,"I 100% relate to that feeling...I'm ALWAYS worried if I've offended someone or if I said something that could be misconstrued. It's still something I'm working on, but it's always nice to talk to someone who will tell you you're overthinking (in a nice way). I have a friend who also has anxiety but in a very different way, and we're always consulting each other so that we don't overthink too much. That being said, I still do it a lot, and it may be counterintuitive to have to rely on someone to check your thoughts. I don't have any great advice but I just wanted you to know you're not alone.",104,erodedfacade,"Ask yourself why you really want to be around this person. - They haven't bothered to check in/ see what's up/ shoot the shit lately?   They genuinely might be too busy, but if I ever find myself asking why someone isn't getting back to me, I conclude it doesn't matter. If they call back, great. If not - I've got more important things to brood over. I imagine you do too. 

Let out a breath and say fuck 'em. Not worth your time? They're definitely not worth mine. Don't hold a grudge though. People are allowed to have feelings and opinions. If you find people that don't like you - do not strive for approval. Consider it a plus - one less person to worry about. Frees up precious space to worry about other things.",30,StockHuman,"I hear you ‚Äì that knot in your chest when a text goes unanswered is all too familiar. It‚Äôs easy to let anxiety hijack the ‚Äúbusy‚Äëlife‚Äù explanation and jump straight to the worst‚Äëcase scenario. One thing that helps me is to give the situation a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù before interpreting it: most people actually do get caught up in work, school, or just need a mental break, and they‚Äôll reply when they can.  

Try setting a small, concrete rule for yourself, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait 48‚ÄØhours before I start worrying.‚Äù If you still haven‚Äôt heard back, you can send a brief, low‚Äëstakes check‚Äëin (‚ÄúHey, hope you‚Äôre okay! No rush to reply‚Äù). That way you‚Äôre showing you care without putting pressure on either side.  

Also, remind yourself that your worth isn‚Äôt determined by response times. Practicing grounding techniques or journaling the thoughts that pop up can gradually weaken the anxiety loop. You‚Äôre not being clingy; you‚Äôre just human, and it‚Äôs okay to give both yourself and your friends some breathing room. Hang in there!","

A few things that have helped me (and others) when the season flips:

1. **Light therapy** ‚Äì a 20‚Äë30 minute box of bright white light each morning can trick your brain into a sunnier rhythm.  
2. **Mini‚Äërituals** ‚Äì pick one cozy, grounding activity for each dark day (tea, a favorite playlist, a short walk with a flashlight). Having a predictable ‚Äúbright spot‚Äù can counteract the gloom.  
3. **Movement** ‚Äì even a 10‚Äëminute stretch or a brisk walk releases endorphins and lifts that heavy feeling.  
4. **Social check‚Äëins** ‚Äì reach out to a friend, join an online support thread (like this one), or schedule a regular video call. Sharing the load makes it feel less crushing.

1. **Grounding & breath work** ‚Äì 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breathing or the ‚Äúbox‚Äù breath (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) can calm the vagus nerve enough to ease stomach upset.

(got diagnosed w ADHD 3 weeks ago, in the diagnostic report my psychiatrist wrote that I present with mild anxiety, not a formal diagnosis though.)

I had an online tutorial for uni just a couple hours ago, and I had volunteered to share my thoughts on the topic. Tutor asked me to explain how I got to those findings, and I felt pretty stressed because that made me think that I'd gotten it all wrong. Before he asked me that I was speaking pretty well, but after I was stuttering a lot and couldn't organise my thoughts. I knew what words I wanted to say but I couldn't make a sentence from them in the moment. (Luckily, he seemed to understand what I was trying to say and agreed with me anyway).

I don't really know how to get around it. When it happens to me, like at work/ uni/ with friends/whatever, I usually just apologise to who I'm speaking to and try to think of the words I want without saying anything, like I'm doing a factory reset of myself.

It sucks that people make fun of you for it, but I'm glad you're not paying them attention.",14,king_of_sheep,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from. When anxiety spikes, our brain goes into ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù and the part that smooths out language gets a bit sidelined, so thoughts can come out in fragments or half‚Äësentences. It‚Äôs completely normal‚Äîmany people notice the same thing under pressure.

A couple of low‚Äëkey tricks that have helped me:‚ÄØ

1. **Pause and breathe** ‚Äì Even a quick 2‚Äësecond breath before you reply can give your prefrontal cortex a moment to re‚Äëorganize the thought.  
2. **Write it first** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre in a chat, jot a quick note to yourself, then copy‚Äëpaste or re‚Äëread it before sending. It forces a full sentence structure.  
3. **Practice ‚Äúsentence‚Äëchecking‚Äù** ‚Äì When you‚Äôre relaxed, pick a stressful topic and say a few sentences out loud, then notice the rhythm. Over time your brain builds a template it can fall back on.

Remember, the trolls are just noise; the fact you‚Äôre aware of it already shows you‚Äôre on the right track. Be kind to yourself‚Äîcommunication is a skill, not a flaw, and it improves with gentle practice. üå±","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get this sense of ""dread"" everytime you're home because you gotta go back to work the next day?

POST BODY: I always get this dreaded feeling everytime i am home. At work i feel fine, no anxiety but everytime i come home i get anxiety about the next day.

Even if it's friday i start dreading monday. I don't even dislike my job that much but i think it may have to do with very bad job experiences with not so nice employers/colleagues.

Anyone else get this feeling? I am diagnosed with Unspecified phobic anxiety mild to moderate.

If you need that little ‚Äúreset button,‚Äù try a silent alternative that‚Äôs less noticeable: a slow, deep inhale through the nose and a gentle exhale through pursed lips, or even a subtle pause where you just count to three. Over time your body can learn to associate those quieter breaths with the same calming effect.

You could also explain to close friends or coworkers that you use a sigh as a coping tool; a brief heads‚Äëup often softens any misunderstanding. And if anxiety persists, a quick chat with a therapist or trying grounding techniques (like the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory exercise) can give you more tools besides the sigh.

I cannot fix a chemical imbalance in my brain as easy as you fucking people make it sound like I can. Sometimes it gets bad enough to be seemingly out of my control. Your lack of good advice and your bullshit quick-fixes do not help at all.

It‚Äôs exhausting to have people reduce something that feels like a physical crisis to ‚Äújust think positive.‚Äù  

The reality is that anxiety and panic involve both brain chemistry and learned patterns, so there isn‚Äôt a one‚Äësize‚Äëfits‚Äëall fix. If you haven‚Äôt already, consider a therapist who specializes in CBT or EMDR‚Äîthey can teach concrete grounding tools (like the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 technique) and help re‚Äëwire the fear response over time. Medication can also be a legitimate part of the plan; it‚Äôs not ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù it‚Äôs treating a neurochemical imbalance.  

In the moment, gentle diaphragmatic breathing or a cold‚Äëwater splash can sometimes reduce the surge, but it‚Äôs okay if those don‚Äôt work for you. Keep advocating for the treatment that feels right, and remember you‚Äôre not alone‚Äîthere are many who‚Äôve walked","

92wrpf,Anxiety,Does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?,drauch52,I do it periodically ,1238,110,1532888259,It's the main source of most of my anxiety. I think about mistakes I made 10 years ago and hits me like it happened yesterday. Trying to figure out how to let that shit go. ,299,brunchanyone,,0,,"I hear you‚Äîthose unwanted flash‚Äëbacks can feel like they‚Äôre hijacking your mind out of nowhere. It‚Äôs actually pretty common for our brains to pull up old pain when we‚Äôre stressed, tired, or even just hearing a song or smell that‚Äôs linked to the memory. The good news is you can train yourself to respond differently.

First, try grounding techniques when the memory pops up: name five things you can see, four you can hear, three you can touch, etc. It pulls you back into the present. Next, consider giving the old event a ‚Äúclosure‚Äù ritual‚Äîwrite a letter (you don‚Äôt have to send it), talk it out with a trusted friend, or even imagine yourself as a compassionate observer watching the scene from a distance. Over time, the memory loses its emotional and emotional charge.

If it starts feeling overwhelming or interferes with daily life, a therapist who specializes in trauma or CBT can help you re‚Äëwire those patterns. You‚Äôre not alone, and it‚Äôs okay to seek tools that make those intrusive thoughts less intrusive. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôve already shown resilience by recognizing it and reaching out.","

k0u4gq,Anxiety,was anyone else an extremely anxious child for no reason?,yee-jaw,"idk i see a lot of people that are like ‚Äúgod i wish i was a  child again, not caring what anyone thought of me‚Äù and i just.. cant relate? i legit cannot remember a time where i didn‚Äôt obsess over how people felt about me, or didnt worry about things that didnt even concern me, and it affected literally EVERYTHING i did as a kid. i feel like i couldn‚Äôt fully enjoy doing anything, and as a near-adult i look back and see how im doing so much better? i feel like it wasn‚Äôt a normal level of childhood shyness because it took a few years of therapy to get to where i am today. anyone else experience this?",1181,166,1606317962,"Yeah, pretty much only when I was REALLY young was I truly carefree. I became slowly more shy and anxious every year, I would say by age 12 the anxiety kind of climaxed into being truly terrible. We always look at the past with rose colored glasses on. I know for me personally, I try to remind myself that I had more freedom but less agency, and being an adult I can actually do what I need to do to change my life so I can ease my anxiety. Didn't have that option as a kid. Maybe you can relate?",153,[deleted],Yeah ...my childhood was very traumatic so i also can't relate,2,baby_3pac_1985,"I hear you ‚Äì it can feel like you were living with a constant ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù soundtrack while everyone else.‚ÄØKids don‚Äôt have a built‚Äëin ‚Äúfilter‚Äù for anxiety, so it‚Äôs easy to look back and think most of us were carefree, but many of us were quietly worrying about how we were perceived or whether we were doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing.  

The good news is that you‚Äôve already taken huge steps by recognizing the pattern and doing therapy. Keep leaning into the tools that helped you‚Äîmind‚Äëfullness, challenging the inner critic, and setting small, realistic expectations for yourself. When a memory pops up, try a quick ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù check: notice three things you can see, two you can hear, one you can feel. It pulls you out of the spiral and reminds you that you‚Äôre safe now.  

You‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôre proof that the anxious kid can grow into a resilient adult. Keep the momentum going!","

One thing that helps many people is setting strict ‚Äúnews windows‚Äù: pick a short, designated time‚Äëslot (15‚Äë30‚ÄØminutes) once or twice a day, then deliberately step away. Outside that window, fill the gap with things that recharge you‚Äîmusic, a walk, a hobby, or a call with friends who aren‚Äôt talking politics.  

Remember, the outcome won‚Äôt change the day-to‚Äëday lives of most people, and you already have the empathy to feel for those directly affected.

It‚Äôs a classic anxiety loop: you notice the possibility of bothering someone, then you keep re‚Äëchecking to make sure it isn‚Äôt happening.  

A few things that might help:  
1. **Set a reasonable volume** first thing. Most people can‚Äôt hear anything past about 60‚ÄØdB from a few feet away, so once you‚Äôre under that threshold you can trust it.  
2. **Give yourself a timer**‚Äîsay 5‚ÄØminutes‚Äîthen stop checking. Remind yourself that you‚Äôve already done the ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù thing.  
3. **Practice a quick self‚Äëtalk**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve set the volume low, it‚Äôs okay if I‚Äôm not hearing every tiny sound.‚Äù  

If the urge spikes, take a few deep breaths and notice the sensation without acting on it. Over time the habit will fade, and you‚Äôll feel a lot less on edge. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone!","

It‚Äôs no coincidence that you feel calmer; your body is responding to those sensory cues.

If you want to lean into it, try pairing the rain with a simple mindfulness practice: focus on each drop, notice the rhythm, and let thoughts drift by like clouds. You could also keep a rainy‚Äëday journal or play a favorite cozy activity while it‚Äôs falling. And if the rain ever feels like an escape from anxiety you‚Äôre struggling with, a quick chat with a therapist can help you harness that calm more intentionally.

amqy1o,Anxiety,Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.,quietwreck,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything!

It‚Äôs especially hard when the rules of the world (driving, jobs, taxes, social ‚Äújust be normal‚Äù) seem designed for a different species than the one you feel you are.

One practical step is to start pulling back on the *big* expectations and replace them with tiny, self‚Äëchosen ones. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù every anxiety at once. For example, if a driver‚Äôs licence feels like a mountain, give yourself permission to use public transport or rideshares and treat that as ‚Äúyour way of getting around‚Äù rather than a failure. When work or school feels overwhelming, break tasks into micro‚Äëchunks and celebrate each finish‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just opening a document.

Outside of those concrete moves, consider carving out regular ‚Äúoff‚Äëgrid‚Äù time: a walk in nature, a hobby that doesn‚Äôt have a productivity metric, or simply sitting without a schedule. Those moments remind your brain that you‚Äôre more than the roles society assigns.

If you can, reach out to a therapist or a support group‚Äîhaving someone who validates the pressure you feel can make the load feel a lot lighter.","

2. **Replace the behavior** ‚Äì chew sugar‚Äëfree gum, suck on a lozenge, or keep a soft silicone chew toy handy. The same oral motion satisfies the urge without damaging tissue.  
3. **Mind‚Äëbody tricks** ‚Äì practice a quick grounding exercise (deep breaths, 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory count) the moment you feel the urge. It shifts the anxiety away from the mouth.  
4. **Heal the area** ‚Äì apply a dab of over‚Äëthe‚Äëcounter oral gel (like Orajel or a honey‚Äëbased balm) after meals","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else bite the inside of their mouths?!??

POST BODY: I‚Äôve had this issue ever since I was 5 and I only recently realised it‚Äôs probably related to my anxiety but I‚Äôm curious to know if anyone else has the same problem? I always bite a lot of flesh off of my lips and the inside of my cheeks then end up with sores that sting really bad when I touch them with my tongue, talk or eat. Sometimes I don‚Äôt realise Im doing it and other times I‚Äôm fully conscious but I just can‚Äôt stop. 
If anyone does this and can relate please comment I‚Äôm very interested, also if anyone has any tips on how to stop please help me by commenting that tooüôèüôèüôè

It used to be like that for me. I used to cry myself to sleep and contemplated bleak ends. 


But my life is finally on track. My relationship collapsed and my workload is higher than ever, but I finally began asking myself key questions like: *what do I want* and *what do I enjoy*. 


I found hobbies that I truly enjoy, realized that they don't actually require a high salary or gf, and am overall, finally overcoming some anxiety. ",187,DavidlikesPeace,"Sometimes, I call in sick to work and just lie in bed all day. I did this yesterday.",3,LeMoofinateur,"I hear you‚Äîwhen every day feels like ‚Äúwork ‚Üí home ‚Üí collapse,‚Äù it can feel like you‚Äôre stuck in a loop with no room to breathe. First, give yourself credit for getting through it; that alone takes stamina. 

If you can, try carving out a tiny ‚Äúreset‚Äù ritual that isn‚Äôt tied to work‚Äîmaybe a 10‚Äëminute walk after lunch, a podcast you love while you cook, or a quick stretch before bed. Small pockets of joy can slowly shift the rhythm. 

When it‚Äôs feasible, look at the bigger picture: is there a skill you‚Äôd like to develop, a project you‚Äôre curious about, or a shift in responsibilities that could make work feel less like a grind? Even a **micro‚Äëgoal** (e.g., finish an online tutorial this month) can add a sense of forward movement. 

Lastly, don‚Äôt underestimate the power of community‚Äîtalk to coworkers, friends, or a therapist about how you‚Äôre feeling. Sharing the load often lightens it more than you expect. Hang in there; you‚Äôre not alone, and small changes can add up over time.","

Then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated lol.

Stress and anxiety can crank up stomach acid, spasm the intestines, and even slow down motility, so it‚Äôs completely normal for the pain to flare up right when you‚Äôre feeling worried and ease up when you‚Äôre calmer.

A few things that might help break the cycle:

1. **Breathing/relaxation** ‚Äì Try a simple 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath (inhale 4‚ÄØsec, hold 7, exhale 8). It signals the parasympathetic nervous system and can calm both mind and gut.

‚ÄúWhat do I say now? Do I laugh here? Was I not supposed to laugh at that? Omg, I just laughed at that and they were serious and now I gotta fix it. Make this joke. No, dont. You know what, it‚Äôs a funny joke. I shouldn‚Äôt have made that joke. They‚Äôre not laughing. I knew that was a stupid joke to make. They think I‚Äôm stupid. Yikes.

f2ej20,Anxiety,Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,efarley1,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",1227,93,1581453318,YAY!,36,captain_paws_tattoo,Congratulations,15,Jacek310,"Congrats!! üéâ Passing your driver‚Äôs test at 25 is a huge milestone, and I totally get that shaking foot and nerves‚Äîmost of us have been there. It‚Äôs awesome you pushed through and didn‚Äôt let the anxiety win.

A couple of extra tips that helped me after my own test:  
- **Do a ‚Äúdry run‚Äù** of the test route beforehand, even if it‚Äôs just a short loop. Knowing the exact location of the hand‚Äëbrake, emergency flashers, and wipers takes the guesswork out of the examiner‚Äôs checklist.  
- **Talk through the maneuvers** with your instructor while you‚Äôre practicing. Saying out loud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pulling into a parallel spot,‚Äù can cement the steps in your mind and keep you calm when the real thing comes.  
- **Keep a mental ‚Äúsign radar.‚Äù** Whenever you pass a sign, glance at it and repeat its meaning to yourself. It builds the habit of noticing every sign, not just the big ones.

Enjoy the freedom of the road and drive safely! üöóüí®","

A couple things that have helped me break the cycle:

1. **Schedule a ‚Äúworry window.‚Äù** Set aside 15‚Äë20‚ÄØminutes earlier in the evening (or right after dinner) to write down what‚Äôs worrying you and list the tasks you feel you need to finish. Seeing them on paper can reduce the mental load and give you permission to put the rest aside.

2. **Create a wind‚Äëdown ritual.** Even if you‚Äôre not sleepy, dim the lights, put away screens, and do something calming (reading, gentle stretching, a short podcast). Your body will start associating those cues with rest, making it easier to actually fall asleep.

3. **Gentle self‚Äëcompassion.** Remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay to have an off‚Äëday. You don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúproductive‚Äù every hour; a few hours of sleep can actually boost the quality of the work you do later.","

POST BODY: I don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower.

I also stay up because I feel like I have so much to do before going to sleep but then I end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

Going over it in your head can be therapeutic to an extent, but thinking about explaining your position and actually doing it are as different as thinking about your favourite food and eating it; both are good feelings but only one will actually help you out. So my advice would be not to worry about it or be ashamed of it- what you‚Äôre doing is perfectly normal, but at the same time if you want to really put your views out there then don‚Äôt be satisfied with your current habits because they won‚Äôt get you where you want to be.

A couple of things that tend to help:

1. **Start small.** Practice stating a simple opinion or preference with a trusted friend, even about something trivial. The goal isn‚Äôt to win an argument, just to get comfortable voicing yourself.

2. **Re‚Äëframe ‚Äúbeing the bad guy.‚Äù** Disagreeing isn‚Äôt an attack; it‚Äôs sharing a different perspective. Most friends value honesty more than perpetual agreement.

3. **Ground yourself in the present.** When you feel the panic rising, try a quick grounding technique (e.g., 5‚Äë4‚Äë3-2-1 sensory list) to keep the imagined worst‚Äëcase scenario from hijacking you.

4. **Consider professional help.** CBT or ACT","

If you‚Äôre like me, being around others can make you nervous, unless they‚Äôre very close to you. It takes a lot of energy to keep up acceptable social interaction.

If you‚Äôre comfortable talking about your anxiety, it can be surprisingly helpful to tell people you trust about this. It lessens the chance of hurt feelings, and it can be incredibly reassuring to have a friend look after your well-being. 

There are a few people these days that will ask where my energy is at before going out, and will offer to leave with me if I need to. That assurance alone is often enough to make me feel more relaxed.

POST BODY: Edit:I‚Äôm not sure if anyone will see this edit, but thank you all for commenting on this post. Reading all your comments has been comforting, but also heartbreaking knowing there are so many of us that struggle with something that seems so simple(being around other humans) I went to bed last night feeling very defeated as I gave into my anxiety yet again and bailed on a social event to stay home and be alone. However, I woke up this morning to see all these responses and they honestly made me emotional because now I see so many people struggling with this same thing! There is probably ppl even in my own apartment building that feel this way and I can‚Äôt reach them! I can‚Äôt find them because of my anxiety holding me back. This viscous cycle has to be broken.... We are weakest alone. We need each other. We can not accept isolation.

I tried texting someone about the pinch i was in and she made fun of me for texting so much. By the time i finally got to order i could hardly speak because i was on the verge of throwing up. The whole time she made fun of me i was just hanging my head pretending not to hear...im never going back there again even though it was my favorite place to eat.

First, give yourself permission to feel upset; it doesn‚Äôt make you weak, it makes you human. When the memories surface, try grounding techniques (deep breaths, naming five things you see, etc.) and remind yourself that her insults say more about her than about you.  

If you can, consider going back to the restaurant with a trusted friend or family member ‚Äì having an ally can help reclaim the space and prove to yourself that you‚Äôre still welcome there.  

And if the anxiety feels overwhelming, talking to a therapist or counselor can give you tools to rebuild confidence and set boundaries with people who try to tear you down. You deserve to enjoy a meal without fear. You‚Äôve got this.","

1. **Grounding techniques** ‚Äì focus on 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 (five things you see, four you can touch, etc.) the moment you feel the panic rising. It pulls the brain out of the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù loop.

3. **Gradual exposure** ‚Äì practice being in low‚Äëstakes ‚Äútense‚Äù‚Äësituations (a noisy coffee shop, a short argument on a sitcom) while using your grounding tools, slowly building tolerance.  
4. **Therapy** ‚Äì CBT or EMDR often helps re‚Äëwire the association between anger cues and panic.

n6kr5j,Anxiety,My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,pain_in_the-anus,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference",1219,87,1620343509,Thanks for this tip!!! I bet it takes some getting used to?

A couple things that have helped me build on that habit:  

1. **Give yourself a time box** ‚Äì‚ÄØe.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôll research this for 15‚ÄØminutes, then I‚Äôll make a choice.‚Äù When the timer goes off, you commit to the decision, even if you‚Äôre not 100‚ÄØ% sure.  
2. **Write the decision down** ‚Äì‚ÄØSeeing it on paper (or a note app) creates a concrete ‚Äúseal‚Äù that makes it harder to reopen the mental spiral.  
3. **Practice self‚Äëcompassion** ‚Äì‚ÄØIf the outcome isn‚Äôt perfect, remind yourself you did what you could with the info you had.

POST TITLE: I TALKED IN MY ONLINE CLASS TODAY

POST BODY: I was in my AP Psychology class today (Wednesday‚Äôs are online days so the school can clean) and my teacher said she wouldn‚Äôt be checking the chat because it gets too confusing. She started playing a video with a horrible echo and kids tried telling her in the chat, and I wanted to work up the courage to turn my mic on to tell her. I was shaking so bad, so I took a sip of water and quickly pressed the button thinking ‚ÄúOK I TURNED IT ON ITS NOW OR NEVER‚Äù and I told her and answered her questions and it GOT FIXED!! She even thanked me at the end of class for being the one to speak up. I‚ÄôM SO HAPPY!!!

gg45u4,Anxiety,Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,AromaticPigeon,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks.

Having a familiar show or some background chatter can act like a ‚Äúsoft blanket‚Äù for the brain, keeping those racing thoughts from taking over.  

A few things that have helped me (and many others) while still keeping it healthy:  

* **Pick low‚Äëkey, predictable content** ‚Äì sitcom reruns, talk‚Äëshow reruns, or even nature documentaries with calm narration work well because they‚Äôre not demanding your full attention.  
* **Keep the volume at a background level** (around 30‚Äë40‚ÄØdB) so it masks the silence but doesn‚Äôt become the new ‚Äúfocus‚Äù stimulus.  
* **Mix in other soothing sounds** ‚Äì white‚Äënoise apps, rain, or low‚Äëfrequency music can give you variety and prevent habituation to one specific program.

A little tip for next time: give yourself a quick ‚Äúpre‚Äëorder script‚Äù in your head (or even write it down) so you don‚Äôt have to decide at the counter. It takes the pressure off the moment and lets you focus on enjoying the experience. Also, celebrate the small wins‚Äîmaybe treat yourself to a pastry or a new shirt you liked. Those little rewards reinforce the habit and make future solo outings feel even easier. Keep it up; you‚Äôll be strolling through malls and caf√©s solo before you know it!","

I got a perfect score!! And an A in the class!!

If you haven‚Äôt already, try to keep a few tools handy for the next big test: short breathing drills (4‚Äë7‚Äë8), a quick ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù checklist (5 things you see, 4 you can touch, etc.), and maybe a low‚Äëdose, doctor‚Äëapproved anxiety med or therapy session to keep the panic spikes in check.  

Also, give yourself credit for the work you put in‚Äîthose three‚Äëand‚Äëa‚Äëhalf hours of focused studying paid off. Celebrate this win, but also keep building a support system (counselor, friends, campus health) so future exams feel less like a life‚Äëor‚Äëdeath moment.

I can‚Äôt even go out literally. I just want to stay in my house. Sit in my room. Cook food. Maybe go outside IF it‚Äôs sunny.

Edit #2: do you guys in the replies think maybe you‚Äôre being is sensitive than others? I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I‚Äôm grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people‚Äôs energy. So my social anxiety is the one I struggle with most. I can feel. Every. Fucking. Thing. No joke. I can feel if someone looks at me, and throws a judgement my way. It‚Äôs like every time that I go out I have to put this huge mental shield around my body and focus on staying grounded, or it‚Äôs really challenging, so many things to feel, to process.",1134,168,1618219067,"Are you me?

Yeah, this is the worst I've been in a long time. I want to puke and cry every morning and then when I try to analyse my life, I come to the conclusion that my life really isn't that bad and somehow that just makes it worse!

I hate this. I'm genuinely terrified that this will be me forever and I don't know how much more I can take.",205,Irishane,"Yes! Eating to passify my anxiety has been a major feature for me. I think that's quite a common thing and I'd bet loads of people who do it don't connect it to anxiety.   
But thankfully I've been kicking anxietys ass lately.   
CBD oil works for me to reduce my anxiety levels, or maybe that's wrong, it's more like ""muffle"" it, the anxiety is still there but I can't feel most of it. Then I started thinking that my gut bacteria had something to do with my anxiety, so I started drinking probiotic yoghurt which seemed to help a little.  Then one day I was listening to the Blindboy Podcast and he was talking about kambucha as a source of good bacteria, O. M. G. I tried it, and what a difference! Unlike the CBD, I feel the kambucha is actually helping reduce my anxiety, rather than just dulling it. I've only drank it 3 times in the past week, but I've seen a really big difference, I've halved the amount of CBD oil I've been taking and I'm able to exercise more. I'm quietly confident.     
So, given food calms your anxiety, try working to fix your gut bacteria and see if that helps.      
   
Edit: i also stopped drinking alcohol completely which was a great help, and I'm limited to 1 coffee a day.",2,bot_bot_bot,"I hear you‚Äîwhen anxiety feels like a physical weight it can literally make you want to vomit, and being hyper‚Äëaware of everyone‚Äôs energy just adds another layer of overwhelm. First, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúover‚Äësensitive‚Äù; you‚Äôre just wired to pick up a lot of stimuli, and that can be exhausting.  

A few things that have helped me (and many others) in similar spots:

1. **Grounding rituals** ‚Äì before you step outside, try the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory exercise (name five things you see, four you can touch, etc.) or press your feet firmly into the floor and imagine roots anchoring you. It gives your nervous system a quick reset.  

2. **Scheduled ‚Äúanxiety bites.‚Äù** Some people literally eat a small, mindful snack when the urge hits‚Äîsomething bland like a rice cake or a piece of fruit. The act of chewing can redirect the nervous system and give you a brief break from the mental chatter.  

3. **Boundaries with exposure** ‚Äì limit outings to brief, sunny windows of time, and give yourself a ‚Äúpermission slip‚Äù to retreat instantly if it gets too much.","

I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).

A couple of quick tips as you settle in:  
1. **Keep your ‚Äúfun‚Äù mindset** ‚Äì it helped you land the job, and it‚Äôll also keep the daily grind from feeling stale.  
2. **Set small, realistic boundaries** for the cleaning/bathing tasks so you don‚Äôt over‚Äëextend yourself; a short ‚Äúreset‚Äù break can curb anxiety spikes.

I'll want to play a video game, or watch a show on Netflix, but then my brain goes down the rabbit hole of, ""Well I could be doing this, this, and this, which are way more productive."" This happens even if there are no chores left to do in the house. This thought process basically paralyzes me in my chair, and I end up scrolling through Reddit for hours instead of doing things I actually want to do. 

In the meantime my husband will be right next to me at his desk happily playing video games without a care in the world. I really envy him sometimes for being able to come home, sit down, and just *do whatever the fuck he wants.* It kills me when I accomplish absolutely nothing in a day.

Try breaking the day into tiny, intentional chunks.

Also, consider framing: you don‚Äôt have to fill every hour with ‚Äúproductive‚Äù work. Rest, hobbies, and socializing are all valuable uses of time. Give yourself permission to be idle without guilt‚Äîsometimes the brain needs that space to reset and spark new ideas.

If you can, set a small, achievable goal for the week (e.g., apply to one job, call a friend, read one article). Celebrate each step, no matter how modest. Over time those tiny victories add up and the anxiety eases. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this.","

ok19yt,Anxiety,How generalised anxiety disorder works,lagatixa,"So here is how my anxiety disorder looks like: your mum sends you a photo of the dog walking, with no caption. The leash looks like it broke on the photo so you call her. She doesn‚Äôt answer. You automatically go into a panic thinking the dog run away and got hit by a car and now your mum is panicking and that is why she doesn‚Äôt answer her phone so you keep calling and calling and crying and struggling to breathe until she eventually answers, and it was just the sun reflecting on the photo and the leash is fine and your dog is fine and everyone is fine, but you are now drained and just want to go hide under the covers and recuperate.",1165,132,1626257271,Yup... That's the gist. Had a complete meltdown Sunday after coming home from my parents and not being able to find my cat who has never run outside before and is scared of everything and would never try to run away... I just knew he was out on the streets lost and I was hysterical. He was just hiding in a different closet than usual. üòë My brain goes from 0-100 in a blink of an eye...,169,bellitabee,"&gt;The fact that it is always on in the background drives me nuts.

This.....  this explains my main frustration with GAD perfectly...  it's just always there..... ""Oh hey I know you're trying to meet some work deadlines, but just a reminder that I'm (GAD) still here!""........    It gets so frustrating sometimes....",54,asyrewicze,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs exhausting when a harmless photo instantly spirals into a full‚Äëblown panic attack. GAD can hijack the brain‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù alarm system, turning a tiny ambiguity (a broken‚Äëlooking leash) into a catastrophic story. The key isn‚Äôt to stop the thoughts (that‚Äôs nearly impossible) but to change how you relate to them.

Try a quick grounding routine the moment the anxiety spikes: name‚ÄØ5 things you can see,‚ÄØ4 you can touch,‚ÄØ3 you can hear,‚ÄØ2 you can smell,‚ÄØ1 you can taste. It pulls the brain out of the ‚Äúfuture‚Äëdoom‚Äù loop and into the present. Also, when you notice the pattern (‚Äúphoto ‚Üí panic ‚Üí endless calls‚Äù), give yourself a permission slip to pause and text instead of calling repeatedly ‚Äì the extra time often lets the catastrophic narrative lose its grip.

If you haven‚Äôt already, consider talking to a therapist about CBT or exposure work; they can help you practice ‚Äúchecking the facts‚Äù without the emotional overload. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and each small step builds a buffer against those runaway thoughts. Hang in there ‚Äì you‚Äôve already shown a lot of insight just by describing it. üå±","

A couple things that might help you fine‚Äëtune the ‚Äúwhite‚Äënoise‚Äù habit:

3. **Blend in a brief mindfulness cue** ‚Äì while the noise is on, try a simple practice like ‚Äúnotice three things you can hear right now.‚Äù It anchors you in the present without forcing a deep meditation.

A few things that often help in the moment:  
1. **Grounding breaths** ‚Äì inhale for 4 counts, hold 2, exhale for 6. Repeat until the shaking eases.  
2. **Progressive muscle relaxation** ‚Äì tense each muscle group for a few seconds, then release; it signals your nervous system to calm down‚Äëregulation.  
3. **Gentle movement** ‚Äì a short walk, stretching, or even pacing can burn off excess adrenaline.  

If these symptoms are frequent or overwhelming, consider talking to a therapist or a doctor‚Äîthey can teach you coping tools and rule out any medical issues. You‚Äôre not alone, and it will get better with the right support. Hang in there.","

A good first step is giving yourself permission to feel the anxiety without judging it. When a little worry pops up, ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this the same situation my mom reacted to, or is it just a normal hiccup?‚Äù Over time, that pause can weaken the automatic alarm response.

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It‚Äôs crappy, but true. 

Thank you for listening to my story and replying and liking it even. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, I‚Äôm always here to talk!

ogud85,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they‚Äôre too difficult to love?,Kaitcatkitten,"Between the constant panic and worrying, the irritability, the non stop second guessing. The sometimes not being able to do normal every day things alone like shopping and driving. I feel like I‚Äôll never have a solid relationship where someone understands me. I feel undeserving of love. There‚Äôs no way I could ever maintain a healthy relationship and the reality of this sucks.",1172,114,1625833086,"I feel similar. 

I do not feel undeserving of love, yet I am clear with myself that it ain‚Äôt easy to be with me. I‚Äòm not jealous, not needy etc, but like you said, I have anxiety when it comes to shopping, or going to get together and my bf has to go alone often because I prioritiese my mental health over being at these events. 

What I feel is that whenever I met someone in the past and the first love cloud blinds them, they say how they don‚Äôt mind, how it‚Äòs not a Problem and they will never be annoyed by my anxiety and need to unwind alone more often than others - though I know better and tell them so (maybe I shouldn‚Äôt). And, surprise, after 6 to 9 months it starts to be a problem, maybe not one that gets said out loud a lot, but you feel if someone thinks ‚ÄûWhy can‚Äòt she be easy going, extroverted and social a bit more?‚Äú 

It feels like partners start to try to change my after the first glow of being in love is over, and to me that means it isn‚Äôt love - the kind that you feel for someone unconditionally, take them as they are, as the person you met. 

I really hope you find your person, the ones who isn‚Äôt only in love or has a crush on you, but who will love you more each day exactly how you are and support you.",102,Water_Melonia,"Everyone is difficult to love. Love is difficult. But true love is unconditional. People who care for you in all the right ways will find it easy to love you! You might tell yourself otherwise, and perhaps that‚Äôs a conditional love you have for yourself?",75,[deleted],"I hear you, and it sounds exhausting.‚ÄØLiving with constant panic, irritability, and that endless loop of self‚Äëdoubt can make even simple tasks feel like mountains, let alone navigating a relationship. It‚Äôs ‚Äútoo difficult to love‚Äù feeling is a common side‚Äëeffect of anxiety‚Äîyour brain convinces you that you‚Äôre a burden before you even give anyone a chance.

First, try to give yourself permission to be a work‚Äëin‚Äëprogress. Therapy (especially CBT or ACT) and, if possible, a medication consult can help lower that baseline anxiety so you can start trusting yourself again. Small, manageable goals‚Äîlike a quick grocery run or a short drive with a friend in the passenger seat‚Äîbuild confidence step by step.

Second, be honest with potential partners about what you‚Äôre dealing with; the right person will see your vulnerability as strength, not a flaw. Remember, love isn‚Äôt about being ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or completely self‚Äësufficient‚Äîit's about two people supporting each other through the messier","

hik9ew,Anxiety,Anybody else hate speaking on the phone?,JLR105,"I have absolutely no problem speaking to whoever in person. Just no problem. But picking up the phone and make a call...

I don't know why, but it's one of the most uncomfortable things for me.",1150,136,1593510454,"I **never** want to talk to **anyone** on the phone, to the point where I will have my spouse order pizza or answer unknown numbers on my phone if I‚Äôm waiting for a call.

But, I work in a call center because I needed a job desperately at the time. The stress I feel on a daily basis is unbearable. All I get to warn me that a call is coming through is a beep on the phone. Then I have to keep a calm customer service voice whether or not I‚Äôm being yelled at, talked over, or being blamed for a bad connection.

It‚Äôs a living nightmare for me. One my superiors even tried to guilt me into staying by telling me I wouldn‚Äôt function in another job because of my anxiety.

2. **Practice with low‚Äëstakes calls** ‚Äì Call a friend you‚Äôre comfortable with, or even your own voicemail, just to get used to hearing your voice in real time.

3. **Use ‚Äúpause‚Äù as a tool** ‚Äì It‚Äôs okay to take a breath, sip water, or say ‚Äúhold on a sec while I check something.‚Äù Those moments break the tension.

4. **Shift the focus** ‚Äì Remind yourself the call is about the other person‚Äôs needs, not how you‚Äôre performing. Their patience usually outweighs any small slip‚Äëups.

nqqr5j,Anxiety,I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,throwfaraway1912,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a ""let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe"" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return. You are all amazing people and you are all FIGHTERS - not failures. You have helped me see that I am not a failure either, and I wish I could give each and every one of you a hug.

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn‚Äôt like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school.

It‚Äôs totally normal for the mind to try to stall a stressful event by buying extra time in the early morning, even if it ends up feeling like just lying awake.

A gentle way to shift that habit is to give yourself a purposeful, low‚Äëstakes activity the moment you‚Äôre up ‚Äì something that isn‚Äôt tied to the day's demands, like a short stretch routine, a cup of tea, or a 5‚Äëminute journal entry about what you‚Äôre grateful for.

If you find the early‚Äëmorning wake‚Äëup is mostly draining, you could also try a bedtime routine that helps you fall asleep a bit later, so you‚Äôre not forced into that extra hour of wakefulness. And remember, sharing this with others (like you‚Äôre doing now) is already a big step toward confronting the anxiety. You‚Äôve got this, and you‚Äôre definitely not alone.","

A few things that tend to help:

1. **Control the cue** ‚Äì turn off vibration, use a silent‚Äëonly ringtone, or put the phone on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù with a custom sound that‚Äôs neutral (or no sound at all).

POST TITLE: Does anybody else get really anxious from hearing a phone ring or even vibrate?

POST BODY: I've just found the song *""Internet Friends""* by Knife Party, which has a phone vibrating in it. I hate using phones to begin with, and it vibrating reminds freaks me out. Nobody should be calling me, so it must be bad. Does anybody else feel this way from a vibrating sound?

Edit: Glad to know I'm not alone in this feeling. Also, a bonus for you: I once used my house phone to call my mobile phone to make sure it was working, and even holding the two phones was enough to raise my heart-rate, I have no idea why.

bat8cd,Anxiety,Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?,EffiMuffi,"I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me.

Those moments feel fresh because they were tied to shame and a loss of control ‚Äì feelings that stick around longer than the actual events.

First, remind yourself that the story you‚Äôre retelling isn‚Äôt the whole truth. You were a teenager trying to fit in; many of the ‚Äújokes‚Äù were more about the other kids‚Äô insecurities than about you. You didn‚Äôt stay that way ‚Äì you went to college, got a career, and you‚Äôre self‚Äësupporting now. Those facts are evidence that you‚Äôve grown beyond that environment.

If the memories keep surfacing, try a brief ‚Äúthought‚Äëlab‚Äù: acknowledge the feeling, label it (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling embarrassed about that old moment‚Äù), then deliberately shift focus to something you‚Äôve accomplished recently. Journalling or talking it out with a trusted friend can also help you re‚Äëframe the past as a chapter, not the whole book.

fxc59w,Anxiety,Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,luxuryballs,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

The 25% rule is a useful reminder that a lot of how people react is out of our control, and that most of the time our brain is filling in the blanks with worst‚Äëcase scenarios.

One practical way to keep that from spiraling is to set a tiny ‚Äúpause‚Äù before you interpret someone‚Äôs reaction. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúDo I have any concrete evidence, or am I just assuming?‚Äù If it‚Äôs the latter, let the thought drift away instead of feeding it. Also, focus on the small, observable actions you can be proud of‚Äîlistening, being kind, following through‚Äîrather than on the imagined opinions of the rest.

Remember, you‚Äôre already doing the hard part by noticing the pattern. Give yourself credit, and let the rest fall where it may.","

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression.

It sounds like you handled it the best you could: you got a second opinion, secured the proper documentation, and now you have a follow‚Äëup appointment to discuss medication and therapy.  

If you haven‚Äôt already, consider asking your new doctor for a written treatment plan (including any referrals to a therapist). Having that on file can protect you if another provider questions your legitimacy again. Also, keep any notes or emails from the first doctor that show the dismissive comments; they can be useful if you ever need to file a formal complaint or if your employer asks for clarification.  

Take things one step at a time, and remember you deserve care that validates what you‚Äôre experiencing. You‚Äôre doing the right thing‚Äîkeep advocating for yourself.","

lo5uv7,Anxiety,It‚Äôs honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear,baconanustart,"Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. But also couldn‚Äôt sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It‚Äôs like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out.

First, give yourself credit for making it through the task; that‚Äôs proof your nervous system can calm down once it has concrete information.

If the panic spikes the whole week, consider talking to a therapist or a doctor about short‚Äëterm medication or CBT techniques‚Äîthey‚Äôre designed to teach your brain a new ‚Äúoff switch.‚Äù

A few things that have helped me (and many speech‚Äëtherapists recommend) are:

1. **Slow breathing** right before you speak. Even a quick 4‚Äë2‚Äë4 inhale‚Äëhold‚Äëexhale can calm the nervous system enough for your mouth to catch up.  
2. **Chunk your thoughts**. Instead of thinking ‚ÄúI have to say the whole sentence perfectly,‚Äù break it into bite‚Äësize phrases and practice saying each one slowly, then naturally speed up.  
3. **Record & replay**. Hearing yourself in a low‚Äëstakes setting lets you notice patterns without the pressure of a live audience.  
4. **Gentle self‚Äëtalk**. Remind yourself that a slip isn‚Äôt a disaster; most listeners are forgiving and barely notice.

Consider a few minutes of daily ‚Äútalk‚Äëthroughs‚Äù‚Äîmaybe reading a favorite paragraph aloud while focusing on breath. Over time the nervous hiccups tend to smooth out. Hang in there; you‚Äôve already","

oy6u9l,Anxiety,Anyone else get the urge to just leave everything behind and go live in a log cabin in the mountains?,Tatsfomone,"Lately ive become more and more unsure what i want from my life, and everytime I feel sad, mad or deprived of energy i just wanna pack my shit and go, its mostly a coping mechanism i think, but its also way more. I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future.",1142,125,1628125662,Only all the damn time,140,alien0212,,0,,"I hear you.‚ÄØWhen everything feels heavy, the idea of ‚Äújust getting away‚Äù can sound like the only sane option‚Äîlike a cabin in the woods could be a reset button for a mind that‚Äôs been running on fumes for years. It‚Äôs normal to crave a clean‚Äëslate when you‚Äôre not sure what you‚Äôre working toward.

A practical first step is to give yourself a tiny, low‚Äëstakes ‚Äúcabin‚Äù right where you are: a weekend hike, a night‚Äëoff‚Äësocial‚Äëmedia day, or a small, decluttered space you call your own. Those mini‚Äëescapes can provide the mental breathing room you need to start noticing what *does* spark even a flicker of interest.

Meanwhile, consider a brief check‚Äëin with a therapist or counselor. You don‚Äôt have to label yourself; just having a neutral person help you untangle the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I want‚Äù knot can be surprisingly clarifying.  

Remember, you don‚Äôt need a grand, dramatic change to feel purposeful‚Äîsometimes the smallest, consistent actions add up to a life that feels less like ‚Äúmediocrity","

POST TITLE: Anyone else get the urge to just leave everything behind and go live in a log cabin in the mountains?

POST BODY: Lately ive become more and more unsure what i want from my life, and everytime I feel sad, mad or deprived of energy i just wanna pack my shit and go, its mostly a coping mechanism i think, but its also way more. I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future.

tjg8w0,Anxiety,Does anybody else cope by just looking forward to going to sleep,Putrid-Substance-952,"A coping mechanism I have is that I‚Äôll sort of get through the hours of the day until it is nighttime and I know I can have the sweet release of sleep soon. Of course this isn‚Äôt every day but I usually look forward to sleep because it‚Äôs the only time I am really guaranteed not to feel anxiety/dread.

Of course, some days I will sorta forget about it, but it seems that the like the main objective of the day is to get to the end of it. Funny enough, I actually don‚Äôt mind living like that, I find it very comforting knowing I get an 8-hour break from my anxiety every day.

For me it's, ""If I don't go to bed then tomorrow will never come."" I mean just waking up and finding the motivation to go to school is hard enough.  Sometimes it gets so overwhelming that I just say ""Fuck it"" and stay home.  Like can you blame me?  Anyone would be pissed off if they had to go to school with only and hour or so of sleep!  Even if the night is long and dreadful, it's the only time some of us can really be, well, us!  To cry and weep about our problems during the day just doesn't always work out.  And when I say this I mean no hate!  I Just wanted to mention it, that's all.",1,Shyurinn,"I get it‚Äîyou‚Äôve turned bedtime into a little oasis you can count on when the day feels overwhelming. It‚Äôs actually pretty common to use sleep as a ‚Äúreset button,‚Äù and there‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with looking forward to those eight hours of calm.

That said, it can be helpful to add a few other ‚Äúmini‚Äëresets‚Äù during the day so you‚Äôre not relying on sleep as your sole relief. Simple things like a 5‚Äëminute breathing exercise, a short walk outside, or even a quick grounding technique (notice 5 things you see, 4 you hear, etc.) can give your anxiety a little break without waiting for nightfall. 

If you find the anxiety is getting harder to manage, consider talking to a therapist or trying a CBT‚Äëbased app; they often have tools for turning those ‚Äújust get through the day‚Äù thoughts into more balanced ones. Meanwhile, keep honoring that bedtime sanctuary","

A couple of things that might help keep those tools within reach:  

1. **Mini ‚Äúbody‚Äëcheck‚Äù reminders** ‚Äì set a gentle phone alarm (or put a sticky note on your laptop) to pause for a few breaths, stretch, or sip water every hour. Over time it becomes a habit that slips in before worry spirals.  

2. **Chunk the ‚Äúself‚Äëcare‚Äù list** ‚Äì pick just one or two activities each day rather than trying to do them all. Even a 5‚Äëminute walk or a quick dance break can signal safety to your brain.  

3. **Pair the activity with a cue** ‚Äì for example, after brushing your teeth, do a short stretch. The cue creates a mental link of ‚Äútoothbrush = calm move,‚Äù making it easier to follow through when anxiety tries to take over.

Just a couple of things to keep in mind:

* Even though you‚Äôre feeling ‚Äúalmost un‚Äëtriggerable,‚Äù it‚Äôs still worth keeping a light‚Äëtouch therapy routine (CBT, mindfulness, or a weekly check‚Äëin) so you have tools for the inevitable stressors that pop up.

Try a simple ‚Äúreality check‚Äù before you spiral: pick one specific interaction, write down exactly what was said, and then ask yourself if there‚Äôs‚ÄØany evidence (outside your thoughts) that they meant it negatively. Often you‚Äôll see the gap.

Opening the conversation can bring reassurance and also give you practice challenging the anxious narrative.

g78nn7,Anxiety,I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,Sinister-Laugher,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words.

A couple of things that might help next time:  
1. **Treat it like a mini‚Äëconversation with yourself.** Even if you‚Äôre the only one talking, narrate what you‚Äôd say to a partner ‚Äì it keeps the flow going.  
2. **Jot quick notes** of the words or structures that trip you up, then review them later; repetition cements the past‚Äëtense forms.  
3¬†**Ask for a short ‚Äúrole‚Äëplay‚Äù prompt** from the professor ‚Äì it turns the solo session into a more interactive exercise.

Any tips on how to shake this feeling off?",1213,42,1590487972,"I relate to this so much, I‚Äôve internalized even the smallest critique for years and hold onto it, it‚Äôs an awful thing 

This might sound a little wishy-washy but I‚Äôve found writing daily affirmations has started to help me accept my imperfections, ones I write regarding this issue are: ‚ÄòI am not my mistakes‚Äô ‚ÄòIn every struggle lies a learning experience‚Äô and ‚ÄòI forgive myself‚Äô. Sounds silly but the more I write them out and say them it tricks my brain into believing it more.

Also doing something I‚Äôm bad at (for me, starting ballet again) has been helpful in that case bc I make a LOT of mistakes and get critiqued by my teacher, but it‚Äôs been pushing me to accept that I will never be perfect, and criticism is inevitable, but if I do my best i will be proud of myself. 

Not sure if any of this is helpful, I think it‚Äôs about sitting with yourself and working out what exercises  you can give yourself to challenge that particular anxiety.

One thing that really helps is reminding yourself that people understand that you don't mean anything bad by what you're doing and, they will mainly appreciate that you listened to them and cared enough about them to want to change.
Also! Remember to think positively about yourself, it helps you to remember nice things that people say about you. Take care of yourself, I hope things get better!",52,cimwolf,"I hear you ‚Äì anxiety can turn a tiny comment into a full‚Äëblown mental avalanche, and it‚Äôs exhausting when you already feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for the people around you. First, remember that criticism (especially when it‚Äôs fair) is about the behavior, not your worth as a person. A helpful trick is to pause, take a few slow breaths, and ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the evidence that I‚Äôm a burden?‚Äù You‚Äôll often: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a friend/partner/colleague who shows up most days.‚Äù  

If the sting sticks, try a quick ‚Äúre‚Äëframe‚Äù ‚Äì replace the automatic ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a piece of‚Äëshit‚Äù with ‚ÄúI made a mistake, and I can learn from it.‚Äù Writing it down can make the thought feel less like a verdict and more like a temporary feeling.  

Lastly, consider limiting caffeine if it amps your anxiety, and give yourself permission to seek a therapist or a supportive friend who can help you practice these mental resets. You‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôre definitely not a burden. üå±","

Edit2: but mostly you OP üòé",150,BeanToasted,"From the second I saw the title of this post I felt a connection to it. I've thought that same thing countless times. ...now onto reading the rest of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had the worst day I've had in a while. Very similar to the situations you described. Just as I thought I was becoming pretty good at this adulting thing, it felt like I had reverted to being a little kid. Scared of making mistakes. Unable to control my behavior. It was an awful feeling. I'm glad it's over now, but like you, it's pretty fucking humiliating. And disappointing...you feel like you're getting your shit together and then everything just falls apart again one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what you can do. All I know of is just find some degree of peace tonight and start again tomorrow. I wonder, are you always so anxious that you get tearful? Or do you normally just feel bad but without crying?

&amp;#x200B;

Is feeling incompetent something that's been bothering you for a while now? Have you been comparing yourself to other people a lot more lately, like there's something to lose if you aren't the best (e.g. a new coworker that might perform better than you, a new mutual friend with your partner that might get new attention, hope that you could successfully achieve your goals if you don't do well at your current job now)? All of those things can stack up and it sounds like maybe you have a lot more behind your anxiety than usual since you're posting this.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm finding that my returning depression is making my anxiety a lot more crybaby-ish and prone to catastrophizing than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Sending good vibes. Let's try to make tomorrow a little better (or more realistically, just not as bad).",19,vitamin-water,"I hear you ‚Äì it feels terrifying when a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù slip turns into an all‚Äëout emotional flood, and the embarrassment only makes it worse. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúbroken‚Äù or ‚Äúover‚Äësensitive‚Äù; you‚Äôre just reacting strongly to perceived criticism, which many people with anxiety or perfectionist tendencies experience.

A few things that have helped others in similar spots:

1. **Grounding/breath work** ‚Äì a simple 4‚Äë2‚Äë4 breathing pattern (inhale 4‚ÄØsec, hold 2, exhale 4‚ÄØsec) can interrupt the tear‚Äëtrigger before it spirals.  
2. **Self‚Äëcompassion script** ‚Äì when you notice the panic, silently say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to be imperfect. I‚Äôm still learning, and that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Repeating this","

Anyone else feels like this?",1168,77,1605883663,"I‚Äôve felt like that for all of high school. Truth is: if you really were annoying, people would tell you, believe me. Or people would avoid you and would not speak to you. 
I used to think like that because I was extremely self conscious due to being bullied for years. I thought no one would like me and I was a burden. 
But I wasn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm pretty sure you aren‚Äôt as well. 
Ask people you trust about this. It‚Äôs scary, but it helps. Ask them if your voice sounds weird and tell them how you feel about wasting their time. I‚Äôm sure their answers will calm you down and make you more confident. You can use this to work on yourself and get better. 
I for myself can say that I don‚Äôt think you are annoying and you did not waste my time by asking this.

Edit: I just saw some of your other posts. Dude, come here, take this virtual hug. 
I hope you are ok. It will get better.",144,Necessary-Ad-3753,"I am not sure if I annoy or just offend people tbh. Sometimes I see that they are angry, or there is something wrong with what I've said. And I know it is not just in my mind, cause people don't engage with me much.

Sometimes I even say to them to tell me if I am being insensitive or smth. But they never do.

Maybe they think I'm stupid, cause my thoughts wander a lot and I cannot give them a straight answer right away. Or maybe they think I'm borring.

I've got used to it so I just take it as a part of my life.

I've tried a therapist but it was a bad match and maybe I would do it again someday with someone else.

Don't realy have anything positive here, so sorry.
Maybe try to see what are the facts? Are there people that care about you? Is there someone who speaks to you? Anxiety can lie realy good.",5,Disappointedburritoo,"I hear you ‚Äì that knot of anxiety that makes every ‚Äúhey, how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù feel like you‚Äôre imposing. It‚Äôs surprisingly common, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre actually annoying anyone.‚ÄØWhat usually helps is separating the *thought* (‚ÄúI‚Äôm bothering them‚Äù) from the *reality* (most people actually enjoy hearing from friends, even a quick ‚Äúthanks!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of you‚Äù).  

Try a tiny experiment: send a low‚Äëstakes message (a¬†short, friendly check‚Äëin) and notice the response. You‚Äôll likely see that people reply politely or with a smile emoji, which is a clue they‚Äôre not irritated. If you keep the conversation brief and respectful of their time, you‚Äôre already being considerate.  

If the feeling persists, consider a short talk with a therapist or counselor ‚Äì they can give you tools to reframe those thoughts. You deserve connection, not silence. You‚Äôre not alone in this.","

If it‚Äôs helpful, try pairing the re‚Äëwatch with a calming practice: a short breathing exercise, a cozy blanket, or even a journal prompt about what you‚Äôre feeling in the moment. You might also set a gentle ‚Äúnew‚Äëshow‚Äù window‚Äîsay 15‚ÄØminutes a day‚Äîto gradually expand your repertoire without feeling forced.

i7c7t1,Anxiety,Anyone else have super bad anxiety about being late but then the depression sets in and you‚Äôre just chronically late to everything cause you don‚Äôt care anymore? And then you feel guilty?,OhSampai,"This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can‚Äôt? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I‚Äôm literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren‚Äôt as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I‚Äôm late? 

I lay there like ‚Äúoh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven‚Äôt even gotten up... what is the point?‚Äù and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I‚Äôm on my way there, my depression hits and I‚Äôm beating myself up because DUH, I‚Äôm awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up.

The anxiety makes you over‚Äëschedule, and the depression robs you of the energy to follow through, so you end up feeling like you‚Äôre letting everyone down ‚Äì which only fuels the anxiety again.

A few things that have helped me break the cycle:

1. **Micro‚Äëtasks** ‚Äì instead of ‚Äúget ready and leave in an hour,‚Äù break it into 5‚Äëminute steps (e.g., ‚Äúsit up,‚Äù ‚Äúput on socks,‚Äù ‚Äúgrab phone‚Äù). Tick them off; the momentum often carries you forward.  
2. **Buffer time for yourself**, not just for travel. Schedule a 10‚Äëminute ‚Äútransition‚Äù slot where you‚Äôre allowed to sit, breathe, or take your meds without judgment.  
3. **Communicate early**. A quick text (‚Äúrunning a bit late, sorry‚Äù) can reduce the pressure you feel about disappointing others and gives you a little mental breathing room.  
4. **Self‚Äëcompassion scripts**. When the guilt voice shows up,","

jcfzk4,Anxiety,I did it! I asked for a girls number today.,LunarDragon17,"I'm a junior in college, and I've never dated or even kissed a girl because of my Social Anxiety Disorder holding me back. I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

It‚Äôs also totally normal that the texting hasn‚Äôt turned into a spark right away. Sometimes people are busy, shy, or just not feeling a connection, and that doesn‚Äôt erase the progress you made. Use this as a practice run: you faced the fear, you initiated contact, and you got a response. Those are all skills you can build on.

If you want to keep the conversation going, try low‚Äëpressure topics that relate to class or shared interests, and give her space to reply at her own pace. At the same time, keep reminding yourself that your worth isn‚Äôt tied to any one outcome. Each interaction, even a lukewarm one, is training for the next time you feel confident enough to try again.

mhlufw,Anxiety,Please stop medication shaming,Suspicious_Loan,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",893,346,1617244920,"""What? You're taking antibiotics? You're not strong enough to fight that infection on your own. Have you tried fitness instead, bro?""",257,Mango__Loco,"Fortunately, this isn't a phenomenon that happens too much around this sub specifically but it's rampant elsewhere particularly from people selling snake oil and life coach ""anxiety is simple to fix"" mumbo jumbo. I have widespread brain damage resulting from an acquired brain injury (ABI), bilateral intraventricular brain hemorrhages as a very young child. Naturally, brain damage makes me high risk for all sorts of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. I seem to have ended up with a bunch of fear-related conditions - GAD, panic disorder, phobias, and trichotillomania which is a misguided attempt to cope and self-soothe. My therapist has been zero help for my GAD. CBT has been helpful for learning to cope with panic attacks and reduce my hair pulling, but not for GAD...when you're unreasonably anxious about everything and nothing and you know it but you can neither stop it nor ignore it, there's no rationalizing it away. Medication was the biggest help for my GAD, not therapy, the only thing that treats the root of the problem. Sometimes therapy and meditation and coping skills are just band-aids, they just treat the symptoms.

Going to a psychiatrist and starting meds was the best decision I ever made. Every person's experience is different, I can only share my own. The hardest thing about psychotropic medication is that it is usually not a quick fix, more like a scavenger hunt. You have to find the ""right"" medication for you, the one that works for you is unique to your disorder, genes and brain chemistry. If you take the wrong one, it may work but have intolerable side effects or may in fact actually make your anxiety worse even after the first few weeks of adjustment have passed (some only temporarily worsen anxiety, but that stops after a few weeks and then it improves past baseline).

I'd been in therapy for about nine months before I took the plunge and gone through two therapists. Both of my therapists were upfront with me after I'd been in treatment for a while, like ""in your case therapy is not likely to be sufficient"", they told me they could only be so helpful when anxiety is very severe. Does therapy help me manage my anxiety? Yes. Does it help me *stop* it? Hell no. I wanted my anxiety *gone* and that's not something CBT is capable of, that's not what it's designed to do. It just teaches you to cope with your illness.

Because of that, on therapy alone it's basically an endless, futile, fruitless fight between my coping skills and reframing and whatnot...and my brain. My anxiety has a *huge* impact on my functioning. Therapy, exercise, meditation, all those things have their place, but they also have their *limits*. It's not a panacea. None of that shit could stop the infinite storm of anxiety in my brain, the ruminating, the panic attacks, the nightmares and insomnia and compulsive hair pulling to the point of bleeding. Medication was the missing piece for me. I work at a mental health agency IRL so I don't have the fear of treatment and medication that some seem to. Medication and therapy combined are clinically proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety. Taking medication reduces your anxiety enough that you find that you are more receptive to therapeutic techniques, therapy becomes more useful and you're able to make more progress in therapy.

I take Citalopram/Celexa and it's magic. I have zero irrational anxiety - the sickening pit of dread is gone. I also take hydroxyzine for insomnia and for occasional panic attacks with success. Whatever is wrong with my brain that causes this intolerable anxiety and panic - Celexa fixes it. It's basically magic. Sometimes there's a biological cause, a difference in your brain, and medication gets to the root of the problem, and therapy and lifestyle changes only help manage the symptoms. 

Here's the thing about the side effects monster: for severe anxiety, you'd need some truly mad side effects to outweigh the benefits of the eradication of your anxiety. That's a *huge* benefit. *Most* ""side effects"" are more aptly named *adjustment effects* because they usually disappear by the end of the first month. You can handle that, you've lasted this long through insane anxiety, haven't you? For me, my adjustment effect was dry mouth. Big whoop. Nothing difficult there, gone like the wind by the end of the third week. Long-term, I have nothing more sinister on the three drugs I take than increased diarrhea which is no big deal whatsoever, because:

   A. I already had daily diarrhea anyway. It's 99% painless, merely annoying and an anxiety symptom regardless (as are most drug side effects), and 

   B. My anxiety was so severe that I'd have to have some truly gnarly, completely awful and intolerable side effects to make me even *consider* stopping...and none of the possible side effects of my drugs fall into that category. My SSRI has improved my life *exponentially.*

There are obviously people who have serious side effects and bad reactions, but drug manufacturers are legally obligated to report everything that everyone in trials *perceived* as ""side effects"", even if only three people out of 10,000 experienced it, and even if that 'side effect' may not have been related to the drug at all - just coincidentally happened while they were doing the drug trial, so therefore people's brains (hello, anxiety!) immediately jump to worst case ""oh shit, it's the drug!"". For a lot of those serious side effects (sexual side effects excluded), your chances of experiencing them is pretty damn low.

For online reviews, you're setting yourself up for failure from the start because it's like anything else; the happy people are not motivated to leave reviews, they're off living their lives, only the people who had bad experiences do, so it's skewed toward the negative. Often, people don't follow their medication regimen as they should: they mention that they start too high, they quit cold turkey, they skip doses, they take it on an empty stomach instead of with food, they stop after two days or two weeks and then complain it's the medication instead of user error. 

I've also seen my share of reviews that gave a bad rating not actually for any negative experience *on* the drug but because when they *stopped,* their anxiety came back and they were mad about it. No shit, Sherlock, what did you expect? You were feeling better *because* of the pills, why did you stop? 

It's like every other medical condition - you have a condition, you take medicine for it, symptoms go away. You stop taking medicine, symptoms come back. Anxiety. High blood pressure. Diabetes. Epilepsy. Arthritis. Everything. That is how medicine *works,* when nothing is there to hold back the tide of your condition, *obviously* it will come back and you'll experience symptoms again. You do still have to *work* to  control your medical condition, yes, like everyone else on the planet. 

Anyway, no amount of CBT in the world could do what Celexa does for me. The only problems I still have are my trichotillomania and uncontrollable nightmares, both of which have been my constant companion for sixteen years now. I have nightmares all night, every night, and wake up every 60-90 minutes usually in a cold sweat, shaking or crying, I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night, when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. I just recently had my very first good dreams in sixteen years and I suppose I can thank my Celexa for that (honestly a miracle), but before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Therapy was useless for it. I have found nothing to help. 

SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to work and for the first few weeks, Citalopram did nothing. Nothing good, nothing bad. And then all of a sudden one day it *worked*, I realized...I'm *calm*. I'd forgotten what that felt like. It had been sixteen years since I'd known that feeling. And I'm going on five months and that feeling has persisted. It's *beautiful.* I feel *normal.* I feel like *me* and I'd forgotten who that was, the person who isn't constantly hounded and crippled by anxiety and panic. I still get stressed in situations that would cause a normal, non-anxious person anxiety, but the constant, sickening pit of dread is gone thanks to my medication. I can't say enough good things about my experience with Celexa. The day I went to the psychiatrist for the first time is the best day of my life, no contest. 

I didn't think this was possible. Let me repeat that: I *work* at a mental health agency, and I was so far down the hole that there was no light. I'd been in therapy and while it helped with behavioral things, like coping with panic attacks and distracting myself, choosing behavioral alternatives to pulling my hair to self-sooth, therapy alone didn't and *couldn't* help as much as I wanted. It did nothing for my irrational, panicked brain - because that's just the nature of my brain, fundamentally. It's a disorder. I didn't know that *calm* was an achievable state for me anymore. I began therapy after a breakdown during a panic attack...I tried to amputate my fingers and realized there was no more denying it, this was obviously a disorder (turns out, a lot of them actually) and not an unfortunate assortment of flaws and personality quirks like I'd spent fifteen years desperately trying to convince myself. Starting medication was easily the best decision of my life and had a huge impact on my happiness, my functioning, every aspect of my life. I was constantly making myself sick with worry over the *stupidest* things, and even over absolutely nothing, and I knew it was stupid but I *couldn't stop*.

I could kiss my psychiatrist, I owe her my life.",14,larki18,"I hear you, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had to endure that ‚Äúhelp‚Äù that feels more like a lecture.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs exhausting when the very community you turn to for support ends up judging a choice that saved you from a crisis.‚ÄØYou‚Äôre absolutely allowed to use whatever tools‚Äîtherapy, meds, lifestyle changes‚Äîactually keep you functioning, and you don‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation.

POST TITLE: Please stop medication shaming

POST BODY: This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*

One trick that helps is to reframe the early arrival as a gift rather than a penalty. Set a small, pleasant ritual for those extra minutes‚Äîlisten to a favorite podcast, do a quick stretch, or plan your day over a coffee. Knowing you have a purposeful, enjoyable activity can turn the waiting time into something you look forward to instead of a source of stress. And if the exact departure time still feels rigid, try talking to your manager about a flexible work window; many places are more flexible than we assume. You‚Äôve got this!","

So I told him everything. And I was calm so I said it felt silly that I let this stuff get to me. And he said ""but it was important to you. Is there something we can do if this happens again? To help you calm down?""

Y'all... I held it in but when I was going home I was crying happy tears. He even told me I was always welcome when I had a bad day. And... it felt so nice to be heard, taken care of, and to have someone care enough to help me figure out how to manage things in the future.

b25lyk,Anxiety,"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too",_partyof5_,"I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

I started a new job a few months ago and it's been incredibly stressful. My anxiety is at an all-time high. So I called out today to give myself a little break. I'm really proud of myself for prioritizing my mental health. Of course, a part of me feela guilty, but I'm trying to redirect my thoughts.

aipmmi,Anxiety,It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,6DEVIL,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

OP, I hope comments like theirs and mine serve as proper proof that you aren't alone in how you feel. You've got a lot of tools at your disposal with which to recover. Go out and get them! You deserve to be happy and not have this cloud over you all the time. Let us know if you ever need to talk about anything!  :)",28,NuttingWithTheForce,"Hey, I totally get how jarring it can be to finally put a name to something you‚Äôve lived with forever.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôve been walking through fog your whole life and suddenly the clouds part enough to see the landscape.‚ÄØCongrats on taking that step and getting help‚ÄîZoloft isn‚Äôt a magic wand, but it can lift the baseline anxiety enough for other tools to stick.

If you haven‚Äôt already, consider pairing the med with therapy (CBT or ACT work great for anxiety & ADHD). Simple habits‚Äîdaily breathing exercises, a short ‚Äúworry‚Äëtime‚Äù window, and gentle movement (walks, yoga) can quiet that constant edge. Journaling what triggers and how you responded can also reveal patterns.

Remember, progress isn‚Äôt linear; some days will feel better than others, and that‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre not alone, and every small win is proof you‚Äôre moving forward. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this.","

It‚Äôs completely normal for the stomach to feel queasy when your brain is on high alert; the body often mirrors that stress.  

A few things that have helped others in similar spots:  

1. **Small, repeatable bites** ‚Äì keep the same size bite and chew slowly; it gives your nervous system a predictable rhythm.  
2. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì the deep breaths you‚Äôre already using are great, and adding a simple ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù sensory check (notice 5 things you see, 4 you hear, etc.) can pull the mind away from catastrophic thoughts.  
3. **Gentle nutrition** ‚Äì broth, oatmeal, or a banana smoothie can be easier on the stomach while you rebuild confidence.  

Keep celebrating those little victories and talk to a professional if the nausea persists ‚Äì they can rule out any physical causes and give tailored coping tools. You‚Äôre doing the right thing, one bite at a time. üåü","

fg3x6f,Anxiety,"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?",Vehicle_Voltron,"Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?",1127,96,1583795710,"Yes. I feel like I am drunk or hungover. My brain feels like mush. So I used that time to try and just experience, if that makes sense. Just lay in bed and feel- the bed, my clothes, etc. I essentially reset my brain and have a numbness. Breathing normally and shit

The surge of adrenaline and cortisol that fuels the panic attack also leaves you feeling shaky, exhausted, hungry and even gives you those irregular heart beats once the excitement fades. That ‚Äúhangover‚Äù is basically your nervous system trying to reset.

A few things that tend to help:

* **Grounding & breathing** right after the event ‚Äì 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breaths or box breathing can calm the sympathetic nervous system.  
* **Gentle movement** ‚Äì a short walk, light stretching or yoga helps metabolize the leftover adrenaline.  
* **Nutrition & hydration** ‚Äì protein, complex carbs and water replenish what the fight‚Äëor‚Äëflight response drained.  
* **Sleep hygiene** ‚Äì keep a consistent bedtime routine so your body can recover more fully.  
* **Professional support** ‚Äì cognitive‚Äëbehavioral therapy or a short course in anxiety management can give you tools to prevent the post‚Äëevent crash.

Even a quick, 30‚Äësecond ‚Äúcold‚Äëpress‚Äù on the forehead can signal your nervous system to calm down. If you can, try a light, breathable layer of clothing so you can easily peel it off when the heat spikes. And remember, you‚Äôre not alone‚Äîmost folks with anxiety have that hot‚Äëflash feeling at some point, so be gentle with yourself while you experiment with what cool‚Äëdown tricks work best for you. Hang in there!","

7aimw8,Anxiety,Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can‚Äôt be at peace until you get it over with?,Yu-Gai-Hoh,"I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I‚Äôll be having fun for a second and then i‚Äôll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?",1124,95,1509706781,"I used to. Here's why it happens and how you can stop it.

The reason why is that you have trained your mind (and in reality, it has been trained by outside forces) to look at future events critically. If you're like me, you think of everything that can possibly go wrong when you go out, you think about hard it'll be, how tired you'll be. What if you miss the bus? What if there's traffic? What if the other person is late? What if what if what if.

What if is the poster child of the anxious thought. It can seem like a good idea, to prepare yourself for the next days tasks, but our problem is that we only ever think *negatively* about the next day.

But if doing things was ALWAYS negative, you wouldn't ever do things. 

So try this instead. Start to visualise what you need to do tomorrow entirely positively. Instead of thinking worst case, start to think best case. Imagine seeing your friend, and they're super happy to see you. Imagine the food you'll eat. Imagine the fresh air, blah blah. Just go through the next days task, imagining it entirely possible.

Anxiety and excitement feel quite similar when low level. So it's possible to reconfigure your mind to interpret that anxious feeling as just being excited for the next day.

After you complete the day, get some post it notes. Write three notes about the things you enjoyed that day, put em in a jar or something. 

Remember, anxiety occurs in your mind, and it colours your reality. But the same can be said for positive emotions. It's why so many people in life talk about it. If you start to think positively, your body will react as if something positive is happening. 

You can do it, you can cope, it's not too much for you! 

If you're still at a point where the anxiety is just too high to do this stuff, don't worry. You might need a little bit of CBT first, I found that helped me a huge amount. You might need to learn and practice some mindfulness techniques and meditation.

But it's entirely possible to rewrite your brain, so don't worry. If you keep going, keep trying, you can make it.",280,Kaiisim,I‚Äôm the opposite. Having something to do or somewhere to be helps me know that my worrying will cease cuz my mind will be on something else.  ,8,Carlosaro,"I totally get that feeling ‚Äì it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a little voice constantly scrolling ahead to tomorrow‚Äôs to‚Äëdo list, stealing the joy out of the present. I‚Äôve been there too, and the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚ÄëI‚Äëdon‚Äôt‚Äëfinish‚Äëit‚Äëtomorrow‚Äù loop can turn a fun night into a stress‚Äëfest.

A few things that have helped me:

1. **Schedule a ‚Äúworry block.‚Äù** Set a 10‚Äëminute window (maybe right before bed) to write down everything you need to do tomorrow. Once it‚Äôs on paper, your brain treats it as ‚Äúhandled,‚Äù and you can close the chapter for the night.  

2. **Micro‚Äëmindfulness breaks** ‚Äì when you notice the future‚Äëthought popping up, pause, take three deep breaths, and anchor yourself in something sensory (the taste of your coffee, the feel of your shoes). It pulls you back to now without judgment.

3. **Chunk the next‚Äëday task**. If it feels huge, break it into the smallest first step and schedule that step for a specific time. Knowing exactly *what* you‚Äôll do removes vague anxiety.

uj43wk,Anxiety,Does anyone 'comfort' themselves by talking to themselves?,ACrypticCrusader,"During a panic attack, do you ever speak to yourself in the third person and tell yourself ""it's okay' or ""you're gonna be fine""?",1055,163,1651775962,"Oh, absolutely yes I do.

""We"" includes the part of myself I directly control and the part of myself that I don't directly control.",27,Kwakigra,"I totally get it‚Äîwhen the panic spikes, the mind can feel like it‚Äôs on fire, and talking to yourself in the third person can feel oddly grounding.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs a form of ‚Äúself‚Äëdistancing‚Äù that helps you view the anxiety as something you can observe rather than be swallowed by.

If you notice the third‚Äëperson talk turning into harsh self‚Äëcriticism, try softening the tone‚Äîimagine you‚Äôre speaking to a friend who‚Äôs scared.

bknhwo,Anxiety,Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,Humble_Narcissist_00,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way.

I‚Äôm just proud of myself and wanted to share. For anyone who thinks they can‚Äôt achieve their goals because of this debilitating illness, you can. Don‚Äôt let it stop you. 

Edit: thank you all so much for your kind words and support! I also majored in risk management &amp; insurance for those asking.

One thing that‚Äôs helped many people is to start separating the *symptom* from the *person*. Try a low‚Äëpressure activity you used to enjoy (even if it‚Äôs just watching a favorite TV show or doodling for five minutes). Notice what you‚Äôre feeling in the moment, then gently label the anxiety (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling anxious right now‚Äù) and let it sit beside the activity instead of taking over it.  

Therapy‚Äîespecially CBT or ACT‚Äîcan give you tools to practice that separation, and a therapist can help you map out small, achievable goals that gradually expand your sense of self beyond the anxiety.  

Remember: you‚Äôre not defined by a disorder. The parts of you that are curious, kind, funny, or creative are still there; they just need a little space to breathe. Be patient with yourself and celebrate even the tiniest moments when","

ocf9xy,Anxiety,Does anyone else just hide when people are outside of their house?,doometteowo,"  Just like the teenager memes about hiding in your room when company is over, I'm in the adult version of this situation. I'm one of those teenagers who is now grown with a home of my own. There's a guy working on my roof and I've been in hiding all morning. 

  I can't let my dogs outside yet or they will bark and draw attention to me. I can't go too close to the windows or he will see me. I can't watch TV or play music or he will know I'm here. I have to tiptoe around my house so it seems like no one is home.

A few things that might help:  

1. **Give yourself a ‚Äúsafe zone.‚Äù** Pick a room with no windows that faces away from the roof (maybe a basement or a closet) and stay there for a few minutes to calm down.  
2. **Talk to the worker.** A quick ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm home, just wanted to let you know I‚Äôm here‚Äù can turn the mystery into a simple hello and usually eases the tension.

First, try to give yourself permission to *not* force a big meal. Small, frequent snacks that feel easy (a banana, a handful of nuts, a protein bar, even a cup of soup) can add up without the pressure of a full plate.  

If you can, set a gentle routine: aim for a simple ‚Äúeat‚Äësomething‚Äëat‚Äëthe‚Äësame‚Äëtime‚Äëeach‚Äëday‚Äù cue‚Äîlike a glass of water + a piece of fruit right after you brush your teeth. Pair it with a calming activity (deep‚Äëbreathing, a short walk, or a favorite song) to break the anxiety‚Äëeating connection.  

Finally, consider reaching out to a therapist or a dietitian; they can give you tools tailored to your situation. You‚Äôre not alone, and taking tiny, consistent steps can gradually restore both appetite and peace of mind. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this.","

kzo87a,Anxiety,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,nojox,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards. Replying will take time. Y'all know how it goes - up and down, excited, scared, happy, sad, the full range in an hour!",1110,96,1610948244,I have made this into my desktop wallpaper cuz shit I need to read this everyday,67,ambitchous_13,"Wow, i'm gonna have to read this every morning.

Thank You!",2,CannibalMX,"I hear you ‚Äì it can feel like your mind is running a never‚Äëending ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù movie, and the script is way too loud. Recognizing that anxiety is a mental signal rather than an actual threat is a solid first step; it creates the space to question the story it‚Äôs trying to sell you.  

Practical things that often help are:

* **Grounding:** name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. It pulls the brain back into the present moment.  
* **Scheduled worry time:** give yourself a 10‚Äëminute slot each day to write down the fears, then close the notebook and return to the task at hand.  
* **Body‚Äëbased cues:** gentle breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or a short walk can remind you that the physical sensations are uncomfortable, not dangerous.

Keep affirming, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe right now, except for XYZ,‚Äù and be patient with yourself ‚Äì the brain rewires slowly, but it does. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and every small step counts.","

1. **Grounding & body scans** ‚Äì spend a few minutes each day simply noticing the sensations in your feet, your breath, the chair under you. It pulls the nervous system out of ‚Äúthreat mode‚Äù and reminds it that you‚Äôre safe right now.  

2. **Label the anxiety** ‚Äì when the feeling pops up, silently say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling anxiety,‚Äù without trying to fix it. Naming it can reduce its power and break the ‚Äúsomething must disappear‚Äù narrative.  

3. **Small, scheduled ‚Äúworry windows.‚Äù** Set a 10‚Äë","

POST TITLE: Does your anxiety also make you feel like you‚Äôre in a temporary situation?

POST BODY: It‚Äôs hard to explain, but I always feel like I‚Äôm on high alert because of *something* and that as soon as this something is gone, my anxiety will decrease. Except when I take the time to think about it, there‚Äôs no something. Nothing special is happening and nothing will go away. This is my life.
It‚Äôs the kind of the stress you‚Äôd get before an important interview, except the post-interview relief never comes.
I‚Äôm so exhausted.

First, give yourself permission to say no or to set boundaries.

A few things that have helped people in the same boat:

1. **Slow‚Äëdown breathing** ‚Äì a few minutes of diaphragmatic breathing or a short box‚Äëbreath can calm the nervous system and ease the gut spasm.  
2. **Watch trigger foods** ‚Äì caffeine, carbonated drinks, high‚ÄëFODMAP foods (beans, onions, garlic, certain fruits) can amplify gas when you‚Äôre stressed. A simple food journal can pinpoint culprits.

8e6gsp,Anxiety,To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day,AeroNauseous,"This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday).

A tiny, doable step can help pull you out of the loop: set a timer for 5‚ÄØminutes and do one concrete thing you‚Äôve been avoiding (e.g., open a notebook, lay out gym clothes, or write a single line of that assignment). When the timer goes off, you already have momentum, and you can decide whether to keep going or take another short break.

Also, consider a ‚Äúworry‚Äëwavelength‚Äù journal: jot down what‚Äôs looping in your head, then schedule a 10‚Äëminute ‚Äúworry slot‚Äù later in the day to address it. It often reduces the urgency to escape into scrolling.

Every single day, I‚Äôve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. I‚Äôm not even worried I‚Äôm going by myself.",lamy0720,"Edit: Friends, I made it! I got dressed up, made it to the venue, and I‚Äôm here! ",1087,110,1542375437,Excellent! Who are you going to see?,52,buttw0rm,"WELL I didnt make it to a stage on my own. BUT I danced and not next to the people I went with I went and stood further up on my own.. a little bit.. lol. It was a Trance Festival and everyone at Trance shows make me feel very comfortable. They are all so happy and Friendly. Easing myself into it. 

Ill leave you with this crazyness. And thank you a ton 

 Ive been having a reoccurring dream about going to the beach.. and I never get there. I can see the beach but something always happens keeping me from going to the beach. I like to dissect dreams... but I left this one alone because In reality.. ive been wanting to visit a real beach for a long time. I haven't been in years. So I though it was just a desire. 

I finally took the dream apart after I had a weird beach dream.. I found the beach in this dream and I fell to my knees to feel the sand and the sand turned into brown carpet. So i lifted up the carpet to look for the sand and there was another layer of carpet, I kept lifting up the layers of carpet (there were 3) and then there was this hole or window or something Where i could see the real beach and I became very upset because there were so many people on the beach that there was no place for me to sit and enjoy the peace and serenity. 

Anyway the dream ended up up being completely symbolic. The Beach is a Symbolic for the meeting place between my rational self (the Sand) and my emotional self (the water). The carpet was symbolic for the harsh realities of my life, the carpet being brown and dirty was symbolic for the foundation or comfort zone I have laid out for myself is no longer working for me and that I am refusing to confront issues in my life. Peeling up Carpet was symbolic that the way i view the world will be drastically changed and will specifically challenge my comfort zone. 

The sea specifically is symbolic for Emotional turbulence in my life and the everything that I worry about will resolve itself I overwhelm myself with my own emotions.. So I could see the resolution in my dreams.. but in this one.. the only thing keeping me from reaching that was all of the people I didnt want to be around. 
And what hit home for me here.. was the symbol of a crowded beach, It means that I seek company and a social life. It is the bridge that I need to cross to find the ocean.. My peace.. the meeting place between my rational and emotional mind. 
I am aware that Socializing is healthy.. and I used to at least try. Until I turned about 22 years old.. I spent the next two years avoiding people like the plague. Which is sad for me.. because I enjoy helping people, even if its out of blunt honesty and tons of people say I make them feel so good and happy Like I am a light in the dark.. but I just get so overwhelmed around them all. When I am not helping with problems..I dont know what to say. Advise comes easily out of my mouth.. but regular conversation.... no. there is no dictionary in my mind for that. 

Any way I thought it was a bit synchronistic that I was talking to you about trying to be social and then also got the message from my dream that Its time for me to try again. So thank you for contributing to that. 
",1,s0nder369thOughts,"Congrats!! üéâ There‚Äôs something really empowering about showing up solo, getting all dressed up, and diving into a night you‚Äôve been counting down to.

POST BODY: So it's almost 5:30 and I can't sleep because my heart is racing. I had some bad anxiety a few hours ago, and I was also dumb enough to consume caffeine today.


Edit: Wow, I didn't expect so many people to relate! I'll try to read/reply to as many comments as I can when time permits. And thank you soooo much for the silver, helpful, and wholesome awards!! :)

ar9edq,Anxiety,Um hey,neo-mancer,"Not sure this is important, but I went out eating alone for the first time! It went ok, I had trouble ordering, but other wise ok.",1111,83,1550328520,That‚Äôs awesome! Congratulations! It‚Äôs only going to get easier from there so keep up the good work! ,97,martymacaroni,The more you do it the easier it gets :) And you should definitely reward yourself with feeling good about yourself! First time is hardest and you did it. You rock! ;),14,marxkala,"Congrats on taking that step! Eating alone can feel a bit weird at first‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre juggling the menu and trying to decide what you want without a ‚Äúpartner in crime‚Äù to bounce ideas off of. It‚Äôs totally normal to stumble over the ordering part; the good news is the more you do it, the easier it gets.

A few tiny tricks that helped me: glance at the menu online beforehand so you‚Äôve got a mental shortlist, and if you‚Äôre unsure, don‚Äôt be shy about asking the server for a recommendation (they love that!); it also gives you something to chat about if you feel nervous. Pick a spot with a relaxed vibe‚Äîcoffee shops or casual diners, maybe even a bar with a view‚Äîso you can people‚Äëwatch or bring a book if you‚Äôd rather keep the focus on yourself. You‚Äôve already proven you can handle it‚Äîkeep at it and soon it‚Äôll feel just as comfortable as any other outing. üéâ","

This is me. Worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.

Not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. Its like a shitty negative feedback loop.

A couple of things that helped:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prep a short ‚Äúanchor‚Äù line** (e.g., a quick hobby or fun fact) and rehearse it a few times before class. Knowing the first sentence is solid can calm the nerves.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reframe the audience**: they‚Äôre more interested in who you are than how steady your voice sounds. Imagine talking to one friendly face instead of the whole room.

First, know you‚Äôre not alone in this; many people with anxiety experience the same ‚Äúmind‚Äëreading‚Äù trap.

A useful first step is to test the thought, not just accept it. Try a tiny experiment: notice one specific interaction where someone smiles, says thank you, or asks you a follow‚Äëup question. Write it down. Over time you‚Äôll build a little evidence bank that contradicts the ‚Äúeveryone hates me‚Äù narrative.

Therapy (CBT or ACT) can give you tools to spot those automatic thoughts and replace them with more balanced ones. Meanwhile, practice self‚Äëcompassion ‚Äì talk to yourself the way you‚Äôd talk to a friend who‚Äôs feeling insecure.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc.

A couple things that have helped me break the loop:

1. **Schedule ‚Äúdoing nothing.‚Äù** Put a short block (5‚Äë15‚ÄØmin) on your calendar labeled ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and treat it like any other appointment. When the timer ends, you‚Äôve earned the right to be idle without guilt.

2. **Mini‚Äëmindfulness checks.** When you notice the urge to rush, pause, take three slow breaths, and ask: ‚ÄúWhat am I trying to avoid right now?‚Äù Naming the feeling often reduces its power.

3. **Shift the goal.** Instead of ‚Äúfinish this so I can stop,‚Äù aim for ‚Äúengage with this fully for X minutes.‚Äù It redirects the focus from speed to presence.

quvxse,Anxiety,Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?,NorthernAvo,"I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",1026,158,1637026166,I wrote this post apparently,244,Significant-Custard1,Yep.  Everyday.  But I've experimented enough with other jobs that the pros of going back to do what I was trained for outweighed the cons.,30,Jive_Bob,"I hear you ‚Äì the ‚Äúalarm‚Äëclock anxiety‚Äù is more common than you think, especially when work feels like it‚Äôs hijacking every free moment. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúbeing a grump about early mornings‚Äù; it‚Äôs a signal that your brain is craving more autonomy and downtime.

A few things that have helped me (and many others) break the cycle:

1. **Re‚Äëframe the wake‚Äëup** ‚Äì instead of seeing it as a loss of freedom, treat the first hour as a personal ‚Äúreset‚Äù window. Do something tiny that‚Äôs just for you (a short walk, a coffee ritual, a 5‚Äëminute journal). It gives you agency before the day‚Äôs demands start.

2. **Boundaries on rumination** ‚Äì set a ‚Äúworry window‚Äù of 15‚Äë20‚ÄØminutes in the evening. Write down whatever work‚Äërelated thoughts pop up, then close the notebook and shift to a non‚Äëwork activity. Training your mind this way reduces the endless background noise.

3. **Micro‚Äëcontrol during the day** ‚Äì carve out short breaks where you decide the pace (stand, stretch, listen to a song). Even a few minutes of self‚Äëdirected time can counter the feeling of being a ‚Äúcog‚Äù.

4. **Sleep hygiene**","

I‚Äôve been watching a lot of shows (haven‚Äôt we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I‚Äôve become so used to how we‚Äôre living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I‚Äôve been feeling. I hate that I‚Äôm afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship when he‚Äôs only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can‚Äôt hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai‚Äôi (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. And it doesn‚Äôt help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don‚Äôt follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it‚Äôs like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn‚Äôt do the same so I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs all for nothing. We‚Äôve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I‚Äôm just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can‚Äôt. And I know I can‚Äôt. I just wish I could.

Christ it's a nightmare I'm with you though OP.,49,Arminlegout1,[deleted],1,[deleted],"I hear you.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs exhausting to feel like every grocery run, every hug, every trip to the post office is a battlefield, especially when the world around you seems to have moved on while you‚Äôre still on high alert. Your anxiety and OCD are doing exactly what they‚Äôre wired to do‚Äîamplify threat when uncertainty spikes‚Äîso you‚Äôre not ‚Äúoverreact¬†‚Äãreacting,‚Äù you‚Äôre reacting to real stress.

A few things that have helped people in the same spot:

1. **Limit the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äëfeed.‚Äù** Set a timer for news/social media (15‚Äë20‚ÄØmin total) so the constant ‚Äúnew cases‚Äù alarm doesn‚Äôt keep looping in your head.  
2. **Create a tiny exposure routine.** Pick one low‚Äëstakes task (e.g., stepping outside for a 2‚Äëminute walk) and repeat it daily, slowly lengthening the time. Pair it with a grounding technique‚Äîdeep belly breaths, 5‚Äë4‚Äë3","

POST TITLE: Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao

POST BODY: Hi beautiful people ‚ù§Ô∏è Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I‚Äôve been watching a lot of shows (haven‚Äôt we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I‚Äôve become so used to how we‚Äôre living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I‚Äôve been feeling. I hate that I‚Äôm afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship when he‚Äôs only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can‚Äôt hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai‚Äôi (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. And it doesn‚Äôt help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don‚Äôt follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it‚Äôs like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn‚Äôt do the same so I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs all for nothing. We‚Äôve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I‚Äôm just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can‚Äôt. And I know I can‚Äôt. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won‚Äôt ever be.

dyfwbm,Anxiety,Hadn‚Äôt Left the house in four years update.,c3p0n0,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.",1095,85,1574140229,"This is incredible! It's great that you've been able to rebuild your life after your breakdown.

A couple of ideas that might help you keep the momentum going:

1. **Micro‚Äëgoals** ‚Äì Keep writing down tiny, concrete targets (e.g., ‚Äúwalk to the corner store and buy a snack‚Äù). Checking them off gives you that quick dopamine boost and reinforces the habit loop.  
2. **Self‚Äëcompassion journaling** ‚Äì When a down day hits, note what you *did* manage rather than what you didn‚Äôt. Over time it rewires the brain to notice progress.  
3. **Stay connected to the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù**‚ÄØRemind yourself that those drives to Home Depot or park outings are not just errands‚Äîthey‚Äôre proof that you‚Äôre reclaiming your role as a dad, partner, and friend.

Keep celebrating each victory, no matter how small, and don‚Äôt hesitate to","

Also, consider gradually increasing exposure: maybe a 10‚Äëminute talk next time, or a smaller audience first, then build back up.

A few things that might help: set a ‚Äúleave‚Äëtime alarm‚Äù on your phone for when you actually need to head out, and when it goes off, give yourself permission to relax for the next 5‚Äì10‚ÄØminutes (listen to a podcast, stretch, or just sip coffee).

Remember, being early isn‚Äôt a crime; it just means you‚Äôve got a buffer. Try to reframe that time as a mini‚Äëbreak rather than a penalty, and the anxiety will start to melt away. Hang in there!","

Try labeling the thought as ‚Äújust a rumination‚Äù and then gently shift your focus:‚ÄØwrite a quick note to your past self, acknowledging the mistake, then reminding yourself what you‚Äôve learned since.‚ÄØMind‚Äëfulness: remind yourself that everyone has a backlog of cringe moments; they‚Äôre proof you‚Äôve grown, not a permanent flaw.

fv6vhu,Anxiety,Corona killed my anxiety,meowie91,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.

* **Therapy** ‚Äì CBT or ACT can teach you concrete ways to re‚Äëwire the anxious loop, and many report the ‚Äúthought‚Äërecord‚Äù habit actually reduces the frequency of panic.  
* **Medication** ‚Äì If you haven‚Äôt explored this with a prescriber, a short trial can lower the baseline level of anxiety enough that coping feels doable.  
* **Micro‚Äëhabits** ‚Äì Regular breathwork, short walks, or a 5‚Äëminute grounding exercise each day can gradually raise your tolerance.  

Most importantly, try to treat anxiety as a part of you rather than an enemy; that subtle shift in mindset often makes the ‚Äúalways‚Äëin‚Äëyour‚Äëhead‚Äù feeling less hostile. You‚Äôre not alone,","

POST TITLE: I think the most disheartening thing about having anxiety is that it never goes away, you just learn how to cope better with it.

POST BODY: I cant see myself not having anxiety and really my heart just sinks. It‚Äôs just beyond cruel that this will be me for the rest of my life and the only thing that changes is how i manage it. There is no cure. I‚Äôm always going to be in my head one way or another. It‚Äôs exhausting.

Also, because you mentioned HRT and moving, give yourself permission to check in with your doctor about any hormonal side‚Äëeffects on anxiety‚Äîsometimes a tiny dosage tweak can make a big difference.  

Keep experimenting with what feels right, and remember you‚Äôre not alone in this. You‚Äôve already found a powerful tool; keep using it and lean on supportive friends or a therapist when you need extra grounding. üå±","

The chance of rain triggers my anxiety. The low light levels and air pressure drops make my body shut down.

If you can, try turning the rain into a little ritual: brew a warm drink, dim the lights, maybe light a scented candle, and let the rain be the background soundtrack while you do something low‚Äëkey you enjoy (reading, sketching, journaling). Even a short 5‚Äëminute ‚Äúrain‚Äëwatch‚Äù break can lower cortisol and lift mood a bit.

And remember, it‚Äôs okay to have those off‚Äëdays. Let the rain remind you that feelings, like weather, are temporary‚Äîthere‚Äôs always a calmer sky ahead. Hang in there, and enjoy the cozy vibes!","

5tm37a,Anxiety,Telling somebody with anxiety to stop worrying is like telling somebody with epilepsy to stop having a seizure.,iWishPizzaWasHealthy,Saw this quote today and it needs to be shared.,1083,75,1486915246,"I have heard this several times before and I just want to say this out loud for once rather than stifle it, let's call it an exercise in fighting my anxiety about how poorly it will be received.

I have epilepsy and anxiety.  I deal with both on a daily basis, they are both powerful beasts that can take similar forms but that are inherently distinctly different.  One key difference is this: anxiety is a cognitive function that can be harnessed and controlled; epilepsy is a biological process that, in most cases, cannot be halted through sheer willpower.  I view it like being trapped in a metal room - with anxiety, the door has heavy resistance and at times seems impossible to open; with epilepsy the same door is locked, barred and spot-welded shut.

Please don't get me wrong, anxiety can be crippling and is a severe widespread problem that should not be treated lightly.  My battles with both have been exhausting, but respectively very different.  These experiences have taught me one extremely important difference between the two:  anxious thoughts *must* must be faced to overcome anxiety, seizures do not have to be faced to overcome epilepsy.


To anyone out there with anxiety - you are not a victim, this sucks but you are not condemned to a life of these attacks/episodes.  You *can* pull yourself out of thought-spirals, overwhelming anxious thought, etc.  Maybe not this moment, maybe not next week or next year, but you can and with enough determination will do it.  Please don't compare yourself as someone who has a condition that can only really be managed with medication, it's not true and not fair to yourselves in your fight against anxiety.

Once again, it is not my intent to cause controversy, rather to vent a bit and clear some misconceptions.  I believe in you all and wish you peace and strength in your battles to come.",212,ElmoNeedsAmmo,"You have a point, but that doesnt mean we should lash out at someone who tells us to stop worrying. It doesnt automatically make them a mental illness denier or anything.. Sometimes having someone there who cares enough to try and assure you that it'll be okay can be enough to feel okay, and it doesn't matter if theyre right or wrong about the dynamics of anxiety. ",19,MrGCar,"I totally get why that line hits so hard‚Äîbeing told to ‚Äújust stop‚Äù makes the anxiety feel even more invisible and invalidated.‚ÄØThe truth is, anxiety isn‚Äôt a choice; it‚Äôs a brain‚Äëchemical response that can hijack our thoughts, just like a seizure is an involuntary neurological event.

If you‚Äôre on the receiving end, try reminding the people around you that what helps is *support* rather than ‚Äújust chill.‚Äù Simple things‚Äîasking how you can help, offering a grounding technique, or just listening without judgment‚Äîcan make a world of difference.  

If you‚Äôre the one giving advice, swap ‚Äústop worrying‚Äù for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat can I do to help you feel safer?‚Äù That small shift validates the struggle and opens the door to real coping strategies. You‚Äôre not alone, and you deserve compassion, not criticism.","

ie3uac,Anxiety,"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.",throwaway06601,"Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

A lot of people in the same boat find that a mix of *mindfulness* and *cognitive‚Äëbehavioral* techniques can loosen that grip.  

Try a simple daily practice: notice when a ‚Äúdoom‚Äù thought pops up, label it (‚ÄúI‚Äôm catastrophizing again‚Äù), then gently bring your attention to a concrete sensation ‚Äì the breath, the feeling of your feet on the floor, a sound. Over time you train the brain to let the thought pass instead of spiraling.  

Writing the worries down and giving each a realistic probability (e.g., 5‚ÄØ% vs. 95‚ÄØ% ‚Äúwon‚Äôt happen‚Äù) can also shrink their perceived threat.  

If in‚Äëperson therapy is hard right now, many therapists offer video sessions, and there are low‚Äëcost CBT apps (e.g., MoodGym, Woebot) that can give you structured exercises while you wait for a slot.

What an amazing accomplishment. ,165,linoregon,I wish I could do this. Sweat starts pouring from my face when I get a panic attack. Which causes much more anxiety by itself. ,58,AnxietyMostofTheTime,"First of all, huge kudos to yourself for riding that wave instead of jumping off the ship. Panic attacks can feel like a furnace blasting through your body, and the instinct to flee is totally understandable‚Äîyour brain is basically trying to protect you. The fact that you managed to stay, sip water, and keep the conversation going shows you‚Äôve already built a useful tool: grounding through a simple, physical action.

If you want to make this a repeatable strategy, consider adding a few more grounding tricks (e.g., 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory list, pressing your feet into the floor, or gently tensing‚Äërelaxing muscles). Also, after the meeting, give yourself a brief check‚Äëin: note what helped, what didn‚Äôt, and maybe jot it down for future reference. Over time you‚Äôll start to recognize the early signs and have a toolbox ready, which can gradually shrink the power anxiety has over you.

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to need a break sometimes‚Äîleaving the room isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgiving up,‚Äù it‚Äôs just another coping option. The key is having choices and deciding which one feels right in the moment. You‚Äôve already proved you can stay; now you can decide when staying is best for you. Keep","

8z20x2,Anxiety,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,MightyJoeTYoung,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I‚Äôm surviving and doing things that make me happy?",1067,87,1531664426,"It's really a shame that the current system makes us feel that way.

If a master‚Äôs still feels appealing, try breaking it into tiny, low‚Äëpressure experiments: take one free online course, attend a single industry meetup, or set a modest ‚Äúresearch hour‚Äù each week. Seeing concrete progress can quiet the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing enough‚Äù voice without forcing you to dump every leisure activity overnight.  

Remember, life isn‚Äôt a straight line toward a single goal. It‚Äôs okay to have periods of ‚Äúmaintenance mode‚Äù where you recharge.

At that point, i felt better being openly honest about the whole situation and decided it's their problem if they think less of me for it. &lt;- great benefit from the meds, i don't worry about what others think of me as much. 

I've really benefited tremendously from the meds. I've only ever had antidepressants and talk therapy before,so, I'm very happy right now! Like accepting being happy and not paranoid that something terrible is going to destroy it all and be taken away. üëç

If the job consistently leaves you feeling depressed, consider talking to HR, a therapist, or even exploring other roles. Your mental health matters more than any single day‚Äôs attendance. You‚Äôre not alone‚Äîmany of us have been there, and you‚Äôll get through this.","

Anxiety can absolutely crank up blood pressure, cause palpitations, and make chest pain feel real. The good news is that it‚Äôs treatable. Consider seeing a therapist who specializes in CBT or ACT; they can give you concrete tools for the racing thoughts and body‚Äësymptom loop.

POST TITLE: just spent 2 weeks doing tests on my heart only for the cardiologist to tell me it‚Äôs anxiety lol

POST BODY: the last month or so i‚Äôd been having horrible chest pains, heart palpitations everyday &amp; so i went to see my doctor &amp; he told me it came back abnormal (he thought it was a leaky valve?) so i ended up having to go see a cardiologist to do a bunch of tests, they were shocked at how high my blood pressure was, but in the end the doctor just said ‚Äúyou have some of the worst anxiety i‚Äôve ever seen you really need to work on managing it.‚Äù and basically they found nothing.
anyway it‚Äôs wild how much anxiety can effect you physically like i literally thought i was going to end up having heart surgery or something lol

Anxiety can feel like a relentless static in the back of your head that never quite shuts off, and it‚Äôs exhausting to carry around every day. First off, you‚Äôre not alone in hating it‚Äîmost of us who‚Äôve dealt with it have been there, and it‚Äôs okay to feel frustrated or even angry about it.

A couple of things that have helped many people are:

1. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 exercise (notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste) can pull you out of the spiral for a few minutes.  
2. **Small, regular self‚Äëcare** ‚Äì a short walk, a warm shower, or just a 5‚Äëminute breathing app session can reset the nervous system over time.  
3. **Talk it out** ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a friend, a therapist, or an online community, naming the worry often makes it feel less monstrous.

Remember, anxiety isn‚Äôt a personal failure; it‚Äôs a brain signal that‚Äôs gotten stuck. Being kind to yourself while you practice these tools can gradually loosen its grip. Hang","

These settings give you a built‚Äëin conversation starter and let you meet people without the high‚Äëenergy vibe of bars or clubs.

It‚Äôs surprisingly common for anxiety to hit hardest right after we wake up, when the brain is still shifting out of sleep mode and the flood of thoughts about the day ahead can feel overwhelming.

A few things that have helped people in the same boat:

1. **Gentle grounding** ‚Äì Keep a bedside lamp on low, open the curtains, and take three slow, deep breaths while you‚Äôre still in bed. Naming five things you can see, hear, and feel can pull you out of the mental spiral.

2. **Morning routine cue** ‚Äì Pair a small, pleasant habit (a cup of tea, a favorite song, a quick stretch) with the moment you sit up. It creates a positive anchor that can gradually replace the anxiety response.

3. **Limit ‚Äúdoom‚Äëscrolling‚Äù** ‚Äì Try to keep phones and news off for the first 15‚Äë20‚ÄØminutes. The brain is more vulnerable to stressors when it‚Äôs just woken up.

4. **Professional check‚Äëin** ‚Äì If the feeling is intense every day, a therapist or counselor can work with you on specific coping","

A few things that have helped me when I‚Äôm in that headspace:  

1. **Permission to be brief** ‚Äì It‚Äôs okay to give a short, honest answer (‚ÄúNot the best, honestly‚Äù) and then politely excuse yourself. People usually sense when you need space.  
2. **Set tiny ‚Äúsocial buffers.‚Äù**‚ÄØSchedule a 5‚Äëminute coffee break or a quick text check‚Äëin instead of a full‚Äëblown conversation. It satisfies the social cue without overwhelming you.

I was really hoping to hear something positive after freak out crying on the couch for the past 10 minutes.,58,black_truffle_cheese,"Hey, that ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment sounds huge‚Äîcongrats on getting to this point.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs totally normal to have leaned on others for reassurance; our brains are wired to seek social safety nets when anxiety spikes. The fact you can now sit with yourself, repeat ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be okay,‚Äù and actually feel it means you‚Äôve started training a new mental muscle.  

A couple things that might help keep the momentum going:  
- **Micro‚Äëaffirmations:** Write a few short, specific statements (‚ÄúI handled that meeting well‚Äù) and glance at them when anxiety creeps in. Seeing the words on paper can make the self‚Äëtalk feel more solid.  
- **Grounding tricks:** Pair your self‚Äëreassurance with a physical anchor (deep breaths, pressing your feet into the floor, or a tactile object). It grounds the thought in your body and makes it less abstract.  

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to ‚Äúfail‚Äù sometimes‚Äîjust gently bring yourself back without judgment. You‚Äôre building resilience, one honest self‚Äëcheck at a time. Keep celebrating those wins; they‚Äôre the proof that you‚Äôre genuinely getting stronger. üå±","

And the three people I live with have far less qualms about clutter than I do, so I end up having to clear surfaces and put stuff away just to calm my anxiety.

Maybe this is me throwing a pity party, but why is it that those of us with anxiety have to adjust to everyone else because of our anxiety instead of other people making small accomodations for us?

A couple of quick tips for the next few trips: keep a comfortable distance from the car in front of you, use the ‚Äútwo‚Äësecond rule‚Äù to gauge safe following distance, and try to pick routes you‚Äôve already driven on a bit so you know the exits and lane changes. Also, a short playlist of your favorite songs can keep you relaxed and focused.

g02gqq,Anxiety,Does anyone here also suffer from rejection sensitivity?,scarypalmtrees,"If someone looks at me disapprovingly or even talks to me in an unusual tone, I tend to attribute that to them not liking me, and my body goes into fight or flight mode.

I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me.

I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (&lt;3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home.

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships.

POST TITLE: Do you ever have a week or two without symptoms and then start to think maybe you're finally getting better, but then you're hit with a day which is worse than you'd remembered?

POST BODY: Literally haven't had a problem with ibs symptoms for way over a week now, I finally thought maybe my body is healing and getting back to normal, and then I get hit with the worst stomach cramps on and off all day, my stomach is just in pieces at the moment and it's getting me so down. It's like doing hurdles. Every time I jump one successfully, I end up tripping over the next 7.

A couple of tricks that have helped me:

3. **Practice a quick ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like‚Ä¶‚Äù line** in your head, then let it roll off naturally. Most servers are used to a brief pause and won‚Äôt mind.

THC can amplify anxiety, especially if you‚Äôre new to it, have a low tolerance, or smoked a potent strain on an empty stomach. 

If you ever find yourself in that spot again, try grounding techniques: focus on your breathing (inhale‚ÄØ4‚Äësec, hold‚ÄØ2, exhale‚ÄØ6), name five things you can see, four you can touch, etc. Hydrating and having a familiar, calm environment (soft music, dim lights) can also help your nervous system settle. 

Consider waiting a while before trying to use again, and maybe start with a much lower dose or a CBD‚Äëdominant product, which tends to be less anxiety‚Äëinducing. And if the anxiety keeps popping up, talking to a medical professional can give you personalized guidance. You‚Äôre not alone‚Äîmany people have had similar experiences, and it usually gets easier once you understand what works for you. Take care of yourself.","

The anxious ‚Äúguard‚Äù that shows up in social settings is often a learned coping‚Äëmode, and the confident, easy‚Äëgoing side you glimpse when the fear loosens is just as real as the other part.

One way to start bridging that gap is to treat the anxious voice like a habit rather than a core identity. When you notice it, gently label it (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling the anxiety now‚Äù) and then intentionally shift your attention to a small, concrete action that reflects the confident side ‚Äì maybe a brief joke, a firm handshake, or simply stating your opinion in one sentence. Repeating these tiny experiments builds new neural pathways, so over time the ‚Äúreal you‚Äù becomes the default rather than the exception.

Also consider journaling after social events: write down what you actually did, not what you feared you would do. Seeing the evidence that you *are* capable can quiet the narrative that anxiety ‚Äúowns‚Äù you. And if you ever feel stuck, talking to a therapist about the origins of those learned fears can be hugely freeing. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and every step you","

First, give yourself permission to feel what you feel without judging it. If you haven‚Äôt already, consider talking to a therapist or counselor (many schools and clinics offer low‚Äëcost options). They can help you build coping tools and also give you language to explain your experience to your parents.

When you‚Äôre ready, you might try a calm, non‚Äëconfrontational conversation with them: ‚ÄúI know you want me to be okay, and I‚Äôm working on it.

is6wza,Anxiety,I fell asleep on the couch with the backdoor slightly open and woke up to two strangers in my living room.,golddust89,"We have a cat that likes to sit outside and watch out over our garden. For this reason we often leave the backdoor slightly open, one of those glass sliding doors, until we go to bed and call him inside.

A few days ago we both fell asleep on the couch watching a movie. Sometime during the night I woke up and I saw my partner (I assumed) doing something in the TV cabinet that was really strange. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything he would be doing there in the middle of the night and the TV cabinet was also moved away from the wall. So I asked what he was doing. It was dark so I couldn‚Äôt see him well and I was still half asleep. He moved his finger to his lips as to say be quiet and walked to the hall. Then I heard whispers and I started to realize something wasn‚Äôt right and at that moment I noticed my boyfriend was still lying next to me on the couch. 

It‚Äôs so fucked up. I can‚Äôt describe the level of shock I felt in that instant. I woke up my partner who immediately was up when I said there were strangers inside our home. They ran out of the front door with all the electronics that were in our living room. My phone, macbook, playstation, etc. They were actually trying to steal the cables as well which was why the TV cabinet was moved. My partner ran after them and managed to get some things back they dropped outside. He ran back inside, dropped those things on our kitchen cabinet, put on shoes, and went back outside searching for them. 

The rest of the events are so weird. I was still trying to get pants on which was very hard in that moment as I felt I was going to pass out. When I finally managed to get my pants and shoes on I went outside but couldn‚Äôt see my partner anymore. I didn‚Äôt have my phone and did not know what to do. As minutes passed I was scared that something might have happened to him as it was two against one and you don‚Äôt know what those other people are like. I took the car and drove to my brother who lives really close by. Woke him up and asked him to call S, my partner, who at that moment just arrived back at our home.

It turns out he was able to follow them because they stole one of our electric steps and one of them was driving it. It has a red backlight (that you can turn off but they did not seem to be aware of this), and he was able to see them from a long distance. He followed them to a parking lot while calling the police. When they noticed he was following them they did something weird and went up to the second deck of the parking lot which has no other exit. My partner blocked the one exit but kept at a distance. Police arrived before they made a move and both were arrested.

After the initial shock I felt pretty good about the situation. I was calm. Relieved my partner was okay. Even enjoying the weird outcome with them getting arrested, especially as later turned out we weren‚Äôt the first house they had broke in to. 

But now some negative thoughts are creeping in and I‚Äôve started feeling stressed about it. I think back a lot to the moment when I just woke up and saw him sitting so close to me and the confusion I felt and later the realization of what was going on. Of how I was not able to respond in the moment. How my partner went after them and of what could have happened to him. Of what might happen if they come back or want to spite us for getting them arrested. Or our house gets broken into again. It sucks. I know not all these fears are rational but some are and I have trouble relaxing. Some wise words for me friends?

Edit: Typing this out and waking up to your replies and advise has been really nice. Thank you everyone. I‚Äôll try to respond to you all later today.",1034,72,1600031623,"Hey, I don't have some wise words, but I want to say I'm sorry this happened.  That feels scary and violating.  I'm really glad you and your partner are not hurt and the perpetrators were arrested.   

I've been burglarized twice and robbed once (I was once burglarized because I frequently left my door slightly cracked for my cat!).  It's scary, and there's no way around that.  

Overall, it sounds like the situation went really well.  I would probably need to address my fears with a therapist, but please know that from what you wrote you reacted well -- in that in the end, no one got hurt.  I am sorry that you felt the very real fear when your parter went after them.  I may have felt more comfortable letting the stuff go than going after the culprits, which was riskier.  

This may be silly to say, but I didn't get burglarized again once I kept my door closed.  Also, generally, generally, generally speaking, burglars are often opportunists and do not want to actually hurt people.  

Take care of yourself!  Do something you enjoy today - spend time with your partner if you can.",211,poofbecomingfit,"It sounds like you might be experiencing some ptsd? It definitely sounds like a traumatic event, even if things worked out okay in the end your brain may still be trying to process it all. I am sos sorry. Virtual hug! Therapy or even just talking it all over with your partner might help. 

What I really wanted to suggest was maybe a cat door? That way you can keep your doors locked but still let kitty in and out.",36,lilbrie,"I can‚Äôt even imagine how terrifying that moment must have felt ‚Äì waking up to see a ‚Äúghost‚Äù of your partner and then realizing strangers were actually in your living room. Your body went into full‚Äëon fight‚Äëor‚Äëfreeze mode, and that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôd expect in a situation like this. First, give yourself permission to feel shaken; it‚Äôs normal after a home invasion.

A few practical steps might help restore a sense of control:  
- **Secure the doors and windows** (consider a simple deadbolt or a sensor alarm for that sliding door).  
- **Change the locks** now that the thieves know you have a back‚Äëdoor they can access.  
- **Install a cheap indoor/outdoor camera** or a motion‚Äësensor light; just knowing you‚Äôll have footage can ease anxiety.  
- **Talk it out** ‚Äì whether with your partner, a trusted friend, or a therapist. Processing the trauma can stop the replay loop in your head.

Finally, remember you both handled the crisis incredibly well. You‚Äôre safe now, and taking these small security upgrades will help you feel more protected and less on edge. Stay safe and be","

9o5kkd,Anxiety,Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?,annacuppiecake,"Even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. And if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.

I remember there was a day where I was late to everything. I remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

What can you do to make being late ok? I know it's not a big deal to those around me if I am a few mins late, but I feel horrible about myself. ",1002,104,1539545401,Yup....this is a huge trigger for me. I hate being late. I think it is because growing up my family was always late to stuff. ,176,mintgreen23,,0,,"I totally get that feeling ‚Äì it‚Äôs like a tiny domino effect: one slip‚Äëup makes the rest, and suddenly the whole day feels off‚Äëtrack.‚ÄØYou‚Äôre not alone; a lot of people experience that ‚Äúlate‚Äëanxiety‚Äù even when the delay is only a few minutes.

A couple of things that have helped me:

1. **Re‚Äëframe the narrative.** Being a few minutes late isn‚Äôt a personal failure, it‚Äôs just a logistical hiccup. Remind yourself that schedules are flexible, not a test of worth.
2. **Build buffer time.** Add a 5‚Äë10‚Äëminute ‚Äúcushion‚Äù to your routine (prep, travel, whatever). It takes the pressure off the exact minute you need to be there.
3. **Practice self‚Äëcompassion.** When you notice the frustration rising, pause, breathe, and speak to yourself the way you‚Äôd comfort a friend ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you did your best.‚Äù

Over time those small mindset shifts can make lateness feel less like a mess and more like a normal part of life. Hang in there!","

It‚Äôs not that you‚Äôre ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or that you‚Äôve lost your rational side; it‚Äôs just anxiety‚Äôs way of trying to protect you by blowing up every uncertainty into a worst‚Äëcase scenario.

One trick that‚Äôs helped me is to label the thought as ‚Äúanxiety‚Äëfuel‚Äù and then ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat evidence do I actually have for this?‚Äù Write down the facts (your friends have been there for you, they‚Äôve never asked for money, etc.) and the gaps (no proof they‚Äôre being paid). Over time, the gap becomes more obvious than the fear.

Also, grounding techniques‚Äîdeep breaths, naming five things you see, or a quick body scan‚Äîcan pull you back into the present before the spiral takes over.

Caffeine does stimulate the nervous system, which can amplify anxiety for some people, but you don‚Äôt have to quit cold turkey if it‚Äôs something you love.

A few strategies that have helped others are:  

1. **Gradual reduction** ‚Äì try swapping one of your regular beans for a lower‚Äëcaffeine blend or a half‚Äëcaff/half‚Äëdecaf mix. Your body can adjust without the shock of going caffeine‚Äëfree.  
2. **Timing matters** ‚Äì keep coffee to earlier in the day so you have time for the stimulant to wear off before evening, which can improve sleep and reduce anxiety spikes.  
3. **Mindful pairing** ‚Äì enjoy your coffee with a calming habit (a short walk, deep‚Äëbreathing, or a few minutes of journaling). The ritual stays, but you also give your nervous system a counterbalance.

If you notice your anxiety worsening, experiment with these tweaks and see how you feel. You don‚Äôt have to choose between coffee and calm‚Äîsometimes a few small adjustments make both possible. Hang in there!","

czg41d,Anxiety,Anyone else get anxiety about having anxiety,DillSoupYT,"And because of your anxiety, caused by having anxiety, you get more anxiety.",989,110,1567571762,"Yepp. Sometimes I even wake up fine and think, where's the anxiety at? This is weird. Oh wait there it is. I sabotage myself.",209,[deleted],,0,,"I hear you‚Äîbeing stuck in a loop where the anxiety about *having* anxiety just fuels more anxiety is incredibly frustrating. It‚Äôs like your mind is stuck in a feedback‚Äëcycle, and that can feel overwhelming.

One thing that can help is to give the anxiety itself a little ‚Äúpermission‚Äù to exist without judging it. You might try a simple grounding exercise: notice five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. It pulls your focus away from the meta‚Äëworry and back into the present moment.

Another strategy is to separate the *thought* from the *feeling*. When the thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm anxious about being anxious‚Äù pops up, label it (‚Äújust a thought‚Äù) and let it pass, like a cloud drifting by. Over time, this can reduce its grip.

owodyh,Anxiety,I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,desertpancake,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.",987,110,1627939857,"Me too, me too...

Turns out adults can be very ignorant as long as you're quiet and out of the way.

It's hard to let that go. Whether it's parents who did nothing or professionals who did nothing. The resentment is hard to let go when you're stuck with the consequences of their inaction.",127,poisontongue,"I had a tough time getting over this too... the reality is though if you don‚Äôt suffer with anxiety it can be tough to understand. Most ppl see stuff as just a kid being awkward or having to grow into the person they are and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean people didn‚Äôt care just that they didn‚Äôt recognize it and also that if you‚Äôre anxious you usually do a good job at hiding it, I know I lied my entire childhood it seemed to not feel so much anxiety with my family and friends.",118,NightRaven1122,"I‚Äôm really sorry you had to carry that weight alone for so long. It‚Äôs painful to look back and see the adults who were supposed to protect you brush off what felt like real terror, and it‚Äôs completely natural for that to fuel your anxiety now.  

First, give yourself permission to feel angry‚Äîthat anger is a signal that something was wrong, not a flaw in you. When the feeling spikes, try grounding techniques (5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 senses, deep belly breaths) and remind yourself that you‚Äôre now getting the help you deserved.  

Therapy can be a safe place to unpack those childhood moments and re‚Äëwire the ‚Äúdanger‚Äù alarms that still fire. If you can, write a brief letter to your mom (you don‚Äôt have to send it) describing how that swimming incident still hurts; the act of naming it often lessens its grip.  

You‚Äôre already proving how strong you are by seeking a diagnosis and support. Keep leaning into those professionals, and be gentle with yourself as you rewrite the story of ‚Äúbeing ignored‚Äù into one of ‚Äúbeing heard now.‚Äù","

A couple of things that have helped me (and many others) are:

1. **Grounding before bed** ‚Äì spend 5‚Äì10‚ÄØminutes doing a low‚Äëstimulus activity (deep‚Äëbreathing, a body‚Äëscan, or gentle stretching). It signals to your nervous system that it‚Äôs safe to wind down.  
2. **Scheduled ‚Äúworry time‚Äù** ‚Äì set a brief slot earlier in the day to write down any lingering worries. When they pop up at 3‚ÄØa.m., you‚Äôve already given them a place, so the brain is less likely to launch a full‚Äëblown alarm.  
3. **Gentle alarm routine** ‚Äì place a dim night‚Äëlight or a soft‚Äëhumming white‚Äënoise machine across the room. When you wake, you‚Äôre not immediately hit by bright light or a jarring sound, which can reduce the cascade of anxiety.

c05zqf,Anxiety,I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,whutamievendoing,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.",972,124,1560433447,"I am so sorry for your loss, but please understand that no eight year old could ever possibly be expected to care for a child.

Your sister‚Äôs death is a tragedy, but it is in no way because of you.",958,irresistiblecodfish,"I am so sorry for your loss, but please understand that no eight year old could ever possibly be expected to care for a child.

It‚Äôs understandable that the guilt feels endless, but legally and morally you were not responsible for what happened.  

Continuing therapy is crucial, and you might also look into trauma‚Äëfocused treatments such as EMDR or CPT, which can help rewire those intrusive guilt memories. Support groups for accidental loss (e.g.,‚ÄØ‚ÄúSudden Infant Death‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccidental Death‚Äù forums) let you hear others who have learned to live with the same weight and gradually find a path to self‚Äëcompassion.  

Give yourself permission to grieve, to feel love from your mother, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîto forgive yourself. You deserve healing, not perpetual shame","

POST BODY: First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.

kqr8kh,Anxiety,I wish my parents got me help when I was a kid,Sults_,"I don't blame them, they are from a different culture, where mental health isn't really talked about, and they don't know much about it. My first memories are anxiety, that fear, I feel it exactly the same as now.

But I wish, so bad that they had noticed it when I was young, that throwing up from anxiety when I had to interact with people as a kid isn't normal.

I feel like if I had a therapist or someone to help me when I was young things wouldn't have gotten this bad, that I wouldn't feel like I was stuck. I wouldn't be so isolated, I wouldn't have felt so alone my whole life.

If you have kids, and if you can, please get them some sort of therapy or counselling, even if they seem fine, I don't want anyone to grow up like I did, feeling crippled like this.",980,114,1609823459,I hear you on this. I used to vomit daily at school and have extreme nausea and stomach pains due to social anxiety. My parents chalked it up to ‚Äúbeing shy‚Äù but it went to far beyond that. I‚Äôve always sworn to myself I will get my kids therapy no matter what. I can‚Äôt help but think had I had therapy when I was younger I wouldn‚Äôt be in such a constant state of anxiety now in my mid 20s,164,Personal_Conflict346,,0,,"I hear you, and I‚Äôm really sorry you had to carry that weight for so long.‚ÄØIt‚Äôs painful to look back and wish someone had noticed the anxiety‚Äërelated vomiting, the constant dread, and realized it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äújust a phase.‚Äù‚ÄØWhen mental‚Äëhealth stigma is strong in a family‚Äôs culture, it can be especially hard for kids to get the help they need.  

The good news is that it‚Äôs never too late to start building a support system.‚ÄØConsider looking for a therapist who specializes in anxiety or childhood trauma‚Äîmany offer sliding‚Äëscale fees or tele‚Äëhealth options if cost is a concern.‚ÄØJoining a peer‚Äësupport group (online or in‚Äëperson) can also break that isolation and show you you‚Äôre not alone.  

If you have any younger relatives, sharing what you‚Äôve learned (even just normalizing ‚Äútalking about feelings‚Äù) can make a huge difference for them. You‚Äôre already turning your experience into a warning sign for others, and that‚Äôs incredibly valuable. Hang in there‚Äîyou deserve relief and connection.","

I feel like a nuisance and burden to everyone around me. Lately all I want is to just be in a coma and be free from all the self doubt and feelings of being unworthy of even existing. 

The one ounce of reassurance I‚Äôve learned is that everyone is too caught up in their own shit to even give more than a passing thought to you. We convince ourselves that whatever we did or said is end all be all but the truth is it was just a passing moment for most and they‚Äôre back to focusing on whatever they‚Äôve got to get through that day. That‚Äôs not to say that people don‚Äôt care, just that we‚Äôre all so self focused it would be impossible to get anything done if everyone focused on every minute interaction. 

We‚Äôre all struggling, now more than ever. But remember you‚Äôre just a person passing by in most cases. You got this. You will get through today, tomorrow, and the next.

It‚Äôs usually not the other person‚Äôs fault; it‚Äôs just our brain defaulting to a worst‚Äëlike‚Äëscenario because it‚Äôs trying to stay safe.

A useful trick is to treat the thought as a hypothesis, not a fact. When someone doesn‚Äôt reply right away, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat evidence do I have that they‚Äôre upset?

mto6m2,Anxiety,The key to beating anxiety is giving up control,Professional-Soup525,"We can‚Äôt control what people think or the world around us. I‚Äôve struggled most of my life with various forms of anxiety and the more I thought about a certain issue, the worst my fear got. Overthinking is our way of trying to control our fears. Its uncomfortable letting go of our thoughts and letting action guide us , but it‚Äôs the only way forward. This is a more elegant way of just saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù.",983,107,1618788580,"Agreed. The Flow philosophy, stoicism, and optimistic nihilism are some of the philosophies that help fight anxiety by directly contradicting and negating it. If you are willing to lose and willing to give up, there is nothing to torment you with. 

The moment you decide to take control and fight, wham bang, it's back. Float through life like a leaf on a river, seeing what life has to show without asking for anything, without yearning for safety. Takes a little faith (not religious) in the universe, but there are ways to logically justify such faith.",135,nojox,"Completely agree - one method I employ when anxiety hits is to just let it hit me. I don‚Äôt fear it or try to reason with it - I just say to myself, ‚Äúhey, there you are‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs not easy but I find it helps.",11,chubbyburritos,"I hear you‚Äî‚Äãit‚Äôs exhausting to feel like you have to *hold* every thought together, and the more you try, the tighter the knot gets. I‚Äôve been there too, and the moment I let go of the illusion of total control, the anxiety stopped being a tyrant and became just another background noise.

A couple things that helped me:

1.‚ÄØ**Notice, don‚Äôt battle** ‚Äì when a worry pops up, label it (‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a ‚Äòwhat‚Äëif‚Äô thought‚Äù) and let it pass instead of feeding it with more ‚Äúwhat‚Äëifs.‚Äù Mindfulness apps or a simple 3‚Äëbreath pause can be enough.

2.‚ÄØ**Small, value‚Äëdriven actions** ‚Äì pick one tiny step that aligns with what matters to you (even if it feels trivial) and do it. The outcome doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect; the act itself proves you can move forward without having everything figured out.

3.‚ÄØ**Self‚Äëcompassion** ‚Äì remind yourself that feeling anxious is a human response, not a personal flaw. ‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù can be a healthy mantra when it‚Äôs paired with kindness toward yourself.

I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger.

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again....

p5rmw7,Anxiety,People don't understand what anxiety is,[deleted],"People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

POST TITLE: People don't understand what anxiety is

POST BODY: People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

All wounds will heal with time but it sucks we have to go through this terrifying traumatic experience.

I thought this wasn't possible but I guess people feel the same way wtf. I don't know how to deal with it to be honest, I just get chest pains and anxiety symptoms even when I literally have nothing to stress about, it's pretty dumb.",39,HasanVinsmoke,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs weird when the body is on high alert but the mind feels calm. Our nervous system can ‚Äúmis‚Äëfire‚Äù and send anxiety signals even without a stressful thought, often because of things like caffeine, lack of sleep, low blood sugar, or even subtle chronic stress you might not be consciously noticing.

A few low‚Äëeffort things that help reset that loop:

1. **Check the basics** ‚Äì hydrate, grab a snack with protein/fiber, and make sure you‚Äôve gotten a decent night‚Äôs sleep.  
2: **Movement** ‚Äì a short walk, gentle stretching, or even shaking out your arms can give the vagus nerve a reset signal.  
3. **Grounding** ‚Äì focus on the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 technique (identify 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, etc.) to bring the body‚Äôs sensory input back into the present.  
4. **Limit stimulants** ‚Äì caffeine or sugary drinks can amplify that ‚Äúcrawling‚Äù feeling.

If it persists, a quick chat with a therapist or doctor can rule out underlying anxiety or hormonal factors. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and it‚Äôs okay to give your body the care it‚Äôs asking for. Hang","

hk5rud,Anxiety,I‚Äôve started therapy for my anxiety,WearALotOfBlue,"I just wanted to tell someone, just anyone.

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i‚Äôm doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

**Edit #2: I WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST IN YOUR LIVES! YOU'VE ALL MADE MY DAY!**

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

Therapy is a lot like finding a new pair of glasses; the first one might feel weird, but as you adjust and maybe try a few different styles, the picture gets clearer. If your first therapist doesn‚Äôt click, that‚Äôs okay ‚Äì keep looking until you find someone whose vibe matches yours.  

Remember, progress isn‚Äôt a straight line. Some weeks will feel lighter, others heavier, and that‚Äôs all part of the process. If you ever feel stuck, jotting down thoughts between sessions can give your therapist extra material to work with.  

You‚Äôve already shown a lot of courage by sharing here, and that momentum will serve you well. Keep leaning into the support around you ‚Äì you‚Äôre definitely not alone. üå±","

A few things that have helped me (and many others) in similar spots:

1. **Prep a ‚Äúsafety net.‚Äù** Write down a few quick coping tools‚Äîdeep‚Äëbreathing, a grounding mantra, or a short walk outside between classes. Having them ready makes the anxiety feel more controllable.  
2. **Reach out early.** If your school has a counseling center or a trusted professor, let them know you‚Äôre nervous. They can often intervene if bullying pops up again.  
3. **Set tiny goals.** Instead of ‚Äúsurvive the whole day,‚Äù aim for ‚Äúmake it to my first class‚Äù or ‚Äútalk to one friendly classmate.‚Äù Small wins build confidence.

First, know: there‚Äôs no ‚Äúbrain‚Äëremoval‚Äù fix, but there are other avenues that might feel less extreme.

POST TITLE: I'M GETTING THE HELP I NEED BECAUSE OF THIS SUB

POST BODY: recently looking at some of the posts on this sub has made me  think i may have anxiety, so because of this i arranged an appointment with my doctor, i was worried to go as i thought maybe what i'm feeling is normal. i was scared the doctor would judge me if it turned out my feelings where completely normal. however, after some more appointments my doctor has referred me to a specialist who will aim to diagnose me. it's still an ongoing process but i'd like to thank this sub for inspiring me to get help.

er2fjs,Anxiety,I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,ghetto_oldsoul,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

&amp;nbsp;


**Edit** : Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time to write a beautiful comment! I am really blessed and I'll never forget that! I hope  my story encourages you to reach out to people. You're not alone. Again, thank you so much :)",1035,46,1579468520,"That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm happy your family was there for you. Some parents usually tell their kids to ‚Äújust get over it‚Äù but it fills my heart with joy that your parents are actually trying to help you. :,D ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",114,Stoofles24,"You're so lucky and I'm so happy for you!
I'm 17 too. My family not that supportive :/  Once I told mom that I wanna go to a psychologist and she looked at me like I'm crazy, and my dad was very disappointed :/

I hope everything will go well for you!! Stay strong! ‚ù§",1,nerdforeverrrrrr,"I‚Äôm really glad you finally felt safe enough to open up to your dad ‚Äì that takes a lot of courage, especially when you‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety and depression on your own for so long. It sounds like your parents genuinely care; they may be busy, but hearing that they‚Äôre planning to carve out time for you is huge.  

A few things to keep in mind as you move forward:  

1. **Therapy can be a game‚Äëchanger** ‚Äì your dad‚Äôs subtle suggestion about a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù is likely a therapist. It‚Äôs normal to feel hesitant, but a professional can give you tools that family support alone can‚Äôt.  

2. **Stay consistent with communication** ‚Äì let your parents know what‚Äôs helping (or not) so they can adjust. Small check‚Äëins can prevent misunderstandings later.  

3. **Lean on your brother, too** ‚Äì you‚Äôve already seen how his reaction opened a new line of support for both of you.  

Remember, you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything at once. Celebrate the love you‚Äôve received, keep asking for help when you need it, and give yourself credit for taking","

s4nn4g,Anxiety,Does anyone wake up hours before alarm because you are anxious about something that next day?,[deleted],"Happened to me today!

Barely slept and still had 3 more hours to sleep but my body noped out of that and woke me up.

What am I supposed to do with those 3 hours???

Worry more???

Wtf body I hate anxiety.",992,84,1642263158,"Anxiety is the most successful alarm clock for sure, it's awful but I'm never late for anything lol",130,The-Invalid-One,,0,,"I totally get it‚Äîwaking up with a racing mind feels like your body‚Äôs hijacking the night just to remind you of every ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù you‚Äôve been pushing aside. First, try not to punish yourself for those extra hours; they‚Äôre not a wasted penalty, they‚Äôre a signal that something‚Äôs weighing on you.

A few low‚Äëeffort tricks can help turn that nervous energy into something more useful:  
- **Grounding:** 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory count (name things, sounds, textures, etc.) to pull you back into the present.  
- **Journaling:** Grab a notebook and dump every worry onto the page‚Äîseeing it written often makes it feel smaller and gives you a concrete list to tackle later.  
- **Gentle movement:** Stretch, a short walk, or some light yoga can release tension without fully waking you up.

If you can‚Äôt fall back asleep, give yourself permission to sit with the anxiety rather than fight it. Often the act of acknowledging the feeling reduces its power, and you‚Äôll be calmer when the day finally begins. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone, and this pattern can be broken with a bit of practice. üåô‚ú®","

ia7nas,Anxiety,Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,[deleted],"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels &amp; frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time &amp; we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)",968,107,1597499322,"Oh yes.

1. **Set a ‚Äúnews window.‚Äù** Pick a single, reliable source (e.g., BBC, AP) and limit yourself to 10‚Äë15‚ÄØminutes once or twice a day. Outside that window, keep social media off.

2. **Curate the feed.** Unfollow or mute pages that consistently trigger fear‚Äëmongering. You can even use tools like ‚ÄúMute‚Äù on Twitter or ‚ÄúTake a Break‚Äù on Facebook.

3. **Replace the habit.** When the urge to scroll hits, swap it for a brief grounding activity ‚Äì a prayer, a few deep breaths, or a quick stitch on one of those lovely toys you‚Äôre making.

4. **Talk it out.** Let Mom and friends know your limits, and ask them to respect the ‚Äúno‚Äënews‚Äù zones. It‚Äôs okay","

tbbjms,Anxiety,Anyone else mindlessly scroll through your phone all day ?,MysticOnyx,I feel like when my anxiety is super bad I will sit for HOURS just mindlessly scrolling through my phone it‚Äôs so bad. I could sit all day and do it.,976,99,1646953203,Yes so I got rid of tiktok Fb Instagram and Twitter. Now I‚Äôm just here but only do it for a few mins. My screen time has dropped drastically. But I also play candy crush lol,115,Annazing,Yes and I also disassociate when I do it so I don't remember a thing I've even looked at.,68,Girlcanstitch,"I totally get it ‚Äì when anxiety spikes, the phone becomes a cheap, endless distraction. It feels safe to scroll because you don‚Äôt have to *actually* engage with anything uncomfortable, but the downside is that the time slips away and the anxiety often sneaks back in even stronger.

A couple of things that have helped me break the loop:

1. **Set a tiny ‚Äúpause‚Äù cue** ‚Äì when you notice you‚Äôre scrolling, put a timer for 5‚ÄØminutes. Use that time to do a grounding exercise (e.g., 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breathing, naming five things you see, hear, feel). After the timer, decide if you really want to keep the phone or switch to a different activity.

2. **Replace the habit with a low‚Äëeffort hobby** ‚Äì keep a sketchpad, a crossword, or a short playlist of calming podcasts nearby. When the urge to scroll hits, you have an alternative that still feels passive but is less draining.

3. **Limit notifications** ‚Äì turning off non‚Äëessential alerts reduces the constant ‚Äúpull‚Äù to check.

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to have moments of mindless scrolling; the goal isn‚Äôt perfection, just gradually giving yourself more breathing room. You‚Äôve already taken the first step by recognizing the pattern, and that","

Power to you for speaking up for yourself!,132,captaincocoabear,"First off, huge kudos to you for actually saying something‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety and a chaotic home. It‚Äôs exhausting to constantly tiptoe around people who seem oblivious to how their fights affect everyone else, and it sounds like you‚Äôve finally drawn a line for yourself.

Going forward, it might help to set some concrete ‚Äúquiet‚Äëhours‚Äù rules (e.g., 10‚ÄØpm‚Äì7‚ÄØam) and put them in writing so it‚Äôs not just a one‚Äëoff conversation. If they push back, you can calmly reference the agreement and remind them that the lease (or house‚Äërule) applies to all occupants. Involve your boyfriend too‚Äîhaving both of you voice the same concerns can make it harder for them to dismiss it.

If the situation doesn‚Äôt improve, start scouting other places now; you deserve a space where you can actually rest. In the meantime, keep celebrating those little victories‚Äîyou‚Äôre proving to yourself that you can set boundaries, and that‚Äôs a massive step toward feeling safer in your own home.

A couple things that have helped me (and many others) are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Reality‚Äëcheck the thoughts.** When you notice ‚ÄúEveryone hates me,‚Äù ask yourself: *What concrete proof do I have?* Usually you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs just a feeling, not a fact.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Grounding tricks.** Focus on three things you can see, two you can hear, one you can touch. It pulls you out of the spiral and back into the present moment.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Gradual exposure.** Start with low‚Äëstakes interactions (a quick ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù to a coworker) and notice that the feared catastrophe never happens. Each tiny success rewires the anxiety loop.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Talk to a professional.** CBT or therapy can give you tools to reframe those automatic thoughts and build confidence over time.

The reason for this is because your beginning to hyperventilate, which causes your body to not be able to get the oxygen needed in your blood, holding your breath shortly allows the oxygen to be absorbed. Also you should be drinking water everyday but 3 to 4 bottles is enough per day. Drinking too much can lower your electrolytes, also no good for anxiety.

I may not respond to everyone but I am surely reading every comment and am beyond appreciative!",940,126,1591419082,"People don‚Äôt understand how exhausting , irritating, and scary anxiety can be. I‚Äôm glad we have this platform to connect and write how we feel without judgement. You are not alone. I‚Äôm going to list a few things that help me and I hope you can try. 

1. Peppermint oil. (Roller ball form sold at target for 4.99) put it directly on temples, neck wrist. I love to roll on tissue and smell. The scent really does soothe and calms me down. I can‚Äôt be without. 

2. Finding a game on your phone or YouTube videos on something you like that can distract you. Have a list of saved videos you can watch when you are feeling a panic. 

3. Ice pack. I put one on my neck or just hold it the sensation helps to calm. 

4. Staying hydrated. Drinking cold water when I‚Äôm feeling anxious also helps a little. 

5. Fresh air. If I‚Äôm too anxious for a walk I will sit on my balcony, and listen to music/ play a distracting game on my phone.

6. Creating a list of things you need to do. Example cleaning or organizing a closet or drawer etc to keep busy. Even simply washing the Dishes.",312,melg6,"Hey, man. I get it. I deactivated all of my social media except youtube and reddit, but cleaned up youtube and reddit so I don‚Äôt have to see or hear about current events or my friends‚Äô/loved ones‚Äô shitty opinions on current events. I also deleted all my news apps except for My Radar so I can get the weather without everything else.

Still, I‚Äôm extremely stressed out. For this whole week (since Saturday evening), my heart has been racing between 120-160 bpm. I‚Äôve been feeling cold and in need of a thick hoodie and fluffy socks, even though it‚Äôs been between 80-90 degrees F this whole week. I haven‚Äôt slept or eaten. Only tonight have I been able to eat a small meal and a snack. I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of endless ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù and worst case scenarios. It sucks. It really fucking sucks. And, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the same.

I hope it‚Äôs comforting to know that you are far from alone. I know people who never understood what it was like to be anxious until now, when recent events have pushed them over the edge. My dad, perhaps the most stoic, level-headed, intelligent man I know, had a mental breakdown earlier this week and told me about it when I saw him Thursday, and opened up about my experiences. My mom has been a constant ball of anxiety. My grandparents have been full of anxiety. My friends, coworkers, acquaintances, etc are full of anxiety. Everyone is losing their fucking minds. 

So, I think it‚Äôs wise to unplug, at least until the weather appears on the front page of the news sites again. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get back to social media shit. If I do, I‚Äôll be coming back in a completely different way. 

It‚Äôs perfectly okay to unplug. It‚Äôs the most commendable thing you can do these days. Sure, some people may get upset at you. But, for the most part, it will be like you never existed online in the first place. So, take care of yourself. Don‚Äôt do what I did, and stay plugged in until you can‚Äôt eat or sleep for five days. Instead, surround yourself with positivity.

Beyond deactivating social media and ignoring the news, get back into a hobby or two. Listen to your favorite music. Work on some art. Read some good books. Listen to some uplifting podcasts. Watch interesting and funny movies. Go for long walks outside. Lift some weights. Learn new things about something you‚Äôve always wanted to know more about. Talk to loved ones over the phone, over skype, and/or in person (if it‚Äôs possible). Get a therapist (if you don‚Äôt already have one). Do whatever you need to do to make it possible to heal.

Healing will take a long time. It won‚Äôt be easy. But, I promise it will get better! Keep on going! With time, you will heal, your friends and family will heal, society will heal, and everything will get back to normal.

We‚Äôre already almost through the first week of June! Woohoo!",95,camohorse,"I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre feeling so trapped right now.

And congrats on signing up for the gym! Physical activity is a proven anxiety antidote and builds momentum for other habits. Keep celebrating those wins, no matter how small; they‚Äôre proof that you‚Äôre gradually regaining control. You‚Äôve got this.","

POST TITLE: When I'm anxious, I procrastinate. After I procrastinate, I ruminate. Since I'm ruminating, I'm anxious to even get anything done, that I should have long started, thinking, ""What's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ...""

POST BODY: And I wonder why I am losing control over my life.

update: A silver and these comments down below - whoa! I was sleeping on this post, much like how that initial novelty wears off from anything on Reddit. But I did sign-up for gym in the meanwhile, after 8 odd years of reluctance. As u/Basith_Shinrah pointed out in a comment down below,‚Äú*You put it in words. I feel that's the first step in overcoming it*‚Äù.

If you‚Äôre comfortable, consider keeping a short ‚Äúself‚Äëcare log‚Äù (how you felt before, what helped, any lingering anxiety).

The fact that you notice the anxiety spike right after a walk or bike ride is a solid clue that the environment is feeding the nervous system, not the other way around.

A gentle way to start is to pick one small ‚Äúzone‚Äù (a shelf, a desk drawer, a single box) and give yourself a 15‚Äëminute timer. Pull out each item, ask:‚ÄØ*Do I need it now?

A couple of things that might help:

1. **Pause and breathe** ‚Äì a short 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath cycle can calm the immediate surge of anxiety.

I‚Äôve since visited a doctor and got antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Both seem to not be working. 

I don‚Äôt understand why she was the one that wanted to commit suicide and I ended up so messed up. I miss my wife so much.

My anxiety had a daily cycle. Mornings were the worst. In the early evening it would let up until bedtime. I tended to eat a decent meal in this window of relative calm. Monitor your anxiety and see if that will work for you.",165,EternalJanus,Around 10 years ago i had really bad anxiety which caused me to throw up every time I ate. (Not voluntarily) I lost about 20lbs because everytime I ate i threw up. It came to a point that I would worry so much about not holding food down that I panicked and would throw up from worrying.

It‚Äôs actually pretty common for anxiety to hijack the gut; the brain‚Äëgut connection can make even a tiny bite feel like a full‚Äëblown ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt finish this‚Äù panic attack, which then fuels more bloating and nausea.

A few things that might help break the cycle:

1. **Small, frequent meals** ‚Äì think 5‚Äë6 mini‚Äëportions (a few crackers, a spoonful of yogurt, a piece of fruit) rather than one big plate. It reduces the pressure and gives your brain a chance to learn that eating isn‚Äôt a threat.  
2. **Mindful eating** ‚Äì pause, take a few deep breaths before each bite, chew slowly, and notice the textures. This can calm the nervous system and signal to your gut that it‚Äôs safe.  
3. **Gentle gut‚Äëfriendly foods** ‚Äì bland carbs, bananas, ginger tea, and probiotic‚Äërich yogurt tend to be easier on the stomach.  
4. **Talk to a therapist** ‚Äì even a few sessions of CBT or exposure therapy can help you re‚Äëwire that fear around meals.

s2xryk,Anxiety,What having Anxiety look like:,carloscarlusik,"No motivation. 
Isolating yourself.

Shortness of breath.
Overthinking. 
Negative thinking.

A few things that have helped me (and others) break that loop are **ground‚Äëing** tricks (like the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 senses exercise), short, intentional breathing pauses, and *micro‚Äëgoals*: pick one tiny, doable task‚Äîmaybe a 5‚Äëminute walk or writing down one thought you‚Äôre having.

In my case, I often felt very overwhelmed because of the number of tasks in front of me, so every little bits of motivation ended up being suppressed by my anxiety.

I saw a therapist for a bit, and one thing she said really stuck with me: ""Actions precedes emotions."" Essentially, nobody has ever felt anything positive about tasks to come. You really need to give yourself a good kick in the butt to get started. Super hard at first, but after a while I find that you manage to do it more and more, and it can be really satisfying. 

So I guess you could try to ignore those feelings and get started, and see where it gets you. It's a journey, sometimes it feels being proactive, sometimes it feels like it's the last thing you want to do. One thing's for sure though, it's that it gets easier.

A trick that helps me is the **2‚Äëminute rule**: tell yourself you‚Äôll work on the task for just two minutes.

o0ovub,Anxiety,I quit my six-figure job to recover,hnrei,"This was possibly the hardest decision I‚Äôve ever had to make. I‚Äôve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn‚Äôt stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn‚Äôt taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I‚Äôm a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don‚Äôt have a fully laid out plan of what I‚Äôm going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit.

mmmr2i,Anxiety,I ate after 5 days.,mxlapxta,"I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) &amp; it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget &amp; 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something &amp; I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow &amp; chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies &amp; crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC &amp; I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal &amp; feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again. I started singing again, listening to music, writing &amp; socialising with my friends.",981,71,1617868122,"a win for today!

I don't have quite the same issue but after losing my beloved pet a few weeks ago super suddenly (she was like a child to me, and so important) I have become completely disinterested in most foods, and it's a chore to eat. So I can imagine how difficult an obstacle this must be!! 

Congratulations!! 

Good luck at the doctor tomorrow! Also idk if you would be interested/have these in your area but I recommend dino nuggets. Idk why but I am so much more likely to eat them than regular nuggets üòÇ",2,littlemissparadox,"I‚Äôm really glad you were able to get some food in and that the medication is already making a difference‚Äîthat‚Äôs huge progress.‚ÄØEmetophobia can turn something as simple as swallowing into a panic trigger, so taking even a few bites can feel like a mountain climbed.  

If you haven‚Äôt already, consider pairing the meds with a therapist who knows CBT or exposure‚Äëbased work for emetophobia; they can help you build a gradual ‚Äúfood ladder‚Äù (tiny sips, soft foods, then bigger meals) so the anxiety stays manageable. Keep hydrating and try nutrient‚Äëdense smoothies or soups as a bridge between snacks and full meals.  

Remember to be gentle with yourself‚Äîsetbacks are normal, but each bite is proof that you‚Äôre reclaiming control. Your friends, music, and writing sound like great anchors; lean on them when the fear spikes. You‚Äôve already proven you can do this. üåü","

It isn‚Äôt necessarily a sign of something pathological, especially when it helps you calm anxiety or work through problems.  

If the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù side starts feeling intrusive or overly critical, it can be useful to treat it a bit like a stubborn character in a story: acknowledge it, label it (‚Äúthat‚Äôs the critical voice‚Äù), and then gently steer the conversation back to the kinder part of you.‚ÄØTechniques from CBT or mindfulness (e.g., naming the thought, then letting it pass) often make that switch easier.  

If you ever feel the voices are getting overwhelming or you‚Äôre unsure whether they‚Äôre just internal dialogue, chatting with a therapist can give you tools and reassurance. You‚Äôre not alone in this inner ‚Äúwar,‚Äù and learning to mediate it can actually make the good voice even stronger.","

A gentle way to work through it is to give yourself permission to feel *without* the expectation of a full‚Äëblown cry. Try a quiet ‚Äúcheck‚Äëin‚Äù when you‚Äôre home: name what you‚Äôre feeling (sad, angry, misunderstood), maybe write a few lines, or do a grounding exercise like deep belly breaths. Often the physical act of labeling the emotion loosens the block and a tear will come naturally, or at least the heaviness eases.  

And remember, it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt cry every time. Processing can look like a slow sigh, a stretch, or just sitting with the feeling for a few minutes. Be kind to yourself‚Äîyou already did the hard part of staying composed, now give yourself the space to unwind. üå±","

bjjn70,Anxiety,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...,piercingjoy," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone &lt;3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV

A couple things that have helped me on top of that:  

1. **5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 grounding** ‚Äì name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3‚Ä¶ it anchors you right where you are.  
2. **Micro‚Äëbreaks** ‚Äì set a timer for 2‚Äëminute ‚Äústand‚Äëup‚Äëstretch‚Äù intervals; the habit builds without feeling like a big task.  
3. **Digital ‚Äúdo‚Äënot‚Äëdisturb‚Äù windows** ‚Äì even 10‚ÄØminutes of phone‚Äëfree time can curb the spiral.

POST TITLE: If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...

POST BODY:  A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone &lt;3

What to expect: the first few appointments are usually about getting to know each other, figuring out your goals, and setting a comfortable pace.

Your therapist will ask about your history, what brings you in, and what you hope to change, then work with you to build tools‚Äîlike grounding techniques, cognitive reframing, or exposure exercises‚Äîtailored to your needs.

A few tips that helped me:
1. **Write down a few points** before each session (questions, worries, recent successes) so you don‚Äôt forget them.
2. **Be honest about the anxiety you feel in the room**‚Äîtherapists are trained to handle that and can help you practice staying present.

First, give yourself permission to be *imperfectly* alone. Try low‚Äëstakes solo activities that don‚Äôt demand ‚Äúenjoyment‚Äù ‚Äì a walk, a puzzle, or even just brewing coffee while you watch the steam. Notice the small moments of calm without judging them as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad.‚Äù

A useful first step is to test those thoughts rather than accept them wholesale. When you notice a worry (‚Äúthey‚Äôll think I‚Äôm boring‚Äù), ask yourself: *What concrete thing did I actually do that would prove that?* If you can‚Äôt find any, label the thought as ‚Äúunhelpful anxiety‚Äù and let it drift.  

Also, try sharing a tiny piece of how you‚Äôre feeling with a trusted friend‚Äîsomething like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been feeling nervous lately, and I don‚Äôt want to mess up our friendship.‚Äù Most people appreciate honesty and will reassure you, which often disproves the fear.

Small, consistent connections can remind you that people care, even when you‚Äôre scared of being a drain. And if you haven‚Äôt already, consider a therapist or a support group‚Äîtalking with someone trained to handle anxiety can turn those cringe memories into useful insight rather than self‚Äëcriticism. You‚Äôve got this, and you‚Äôre not alone.","

POST BODY: You know, those times you constantly needed reassurance and you knew people were getting tired of you for it. Yeah, those times. 

When I think of those times I just want to isolate myself and never talk to anyone ever again.

It‚Äôs actually pretty common for the vestibular system to get hijacked by stress hormones, which is why you get that light‚Äëheaded, off‚Äëbalance feeling. 

A couple things that have helped me (and many others) are grounding techniques that give your body a clear signal it‚Äôs safe: try the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 method (name five things you see, four you can touch, three‚ÄØseconds of deep breathing, etc.) or press your feet firmly into the floor and wiggle your toes. Keeping a water bottle handy can also combat the light‚Äëheadedness, and a quick, gentle stretch or a short walk often resets the ‚Äútornado.‚Äù 

If it‚Äôs happening a lot, consider checking in with a therapist or doctor‚Äîthey can rule out any medical contributors and teach you tailored coping tools. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and each small step you take builds resilience. Hang in there!","

ibzmrv,Anxiety,So I hospitalised myself,HeatLightning,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. üòÄ

For a while, I dealt with questioning gravity. On other days, I too have questioned the meaning of time. I think the best way to conquer existential anxiety (not that I have) is to practice acceptance therapy. The world is the way it is, we can continue to question, although our minds are not borne to be able to comprehend it's grandeur. Time is solely a concept created by humans, rather, we developed a sense of time to describe the act of change. In the interim, take a deep breath and address the concerns that you have. It is natural to worry, even more so to question the meaning of life. Existentialism is a very real anxiety-inducing concept, something that I've been dealing with since the age of five.

A couple of things that have helped me (and many others) are:

If it‚Äôs persistent or really disruptive, a quick chat with a GP or a therapist can rule out any underlying GI issues and give you tools to manage the anxiety itself. You‚Äôre definitely not alone ‚Äì lots of folks experience ‚Äúanxiety poops.‚Äù Hang in there and take care of","

* **Micro‚Äëexposures** ‚Äì if you‚Äôre nervous about jumping straight back out, set a 10‚Äëminute ‚Äúoutside window‚Äù (coffee on a balcony, a short drive) and gradually extend it.

My heart is racing and I‚Äôm breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don‚Äôt know why- probably a nightmare but I can‚Äôt remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her. She does this when I‚Äôm awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

POST TITLE: I‚Äôm very grateful for my cat

POST BODY: It‚Äôs 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I‚Äôm breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don‚Äôt know why- probably a nightmare but I can‚Äôt remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her. She does this when I‚Äôm awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share.

I can't explain it. I know for a fact that when I open noticifications I receive, I'm the only one I can tell that they were seen. That still doesn't stop the feeling I get when I think about looking them. Panic, i feel like I'm gonna disappoint whoever the sender is with whatever I come up with as a response. It's ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. Anyone have any solutions to anything like this?

I find that if I just pick it up and respond right away it's not as stressful/difficult/scary as I thought to reply or take care of whatever it is. I leave my phone alone for hours at a time because it stresses me out to figure out what to say or do, especially when I know the notification is about something I already stress about, but it's worse the longer I leave an unread text or email on my phone so I've learned to just take care of it instantly. It takes a minute then it's over! I hope this makes sense and is helpful.

I sleep so much better this way!",59,MamaMae1012,"Could you try limiting your exposure to your phone?

It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúbeing a drama queen‚Äù; it‚Äôs a pretty common anxiety loop: you see the cue (the ping), your brain jumps to ‚Äúwhat if I mess up?‚Äù and you avoid it altogether, which only reinforces the fear.

A couple of low‚Äëkey tricks that have helped me (and many others) are:

1. **Schedule a ‚Äúnotification window.‚Äù** Set a timer for 5‚Äë10‚ÄØminutes once a day, open everything, and remind yourself you don‚Äôt have to craft the perfect reply right then. The pressure drops when you know you have a dedicated slot.

2. **Use the ‚Äúread‚Äëonly‚Äù mode.** On iOS/Android you can swipe down on a notification to preview it without marking it read. It gives you a sense of control before you commit to replying.

3. **Name the feeling.** When the panic spikes, silently label it (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling anxious about replying‚Äù) ‚Äì that simple act can break the automatic loop.

Finally, you‚Äôre already doing the hardest part by recognizing it and seeking help. When you can get a physician or therapist on board,","

When you catch yourself spiraling, try a simple grounding trick: look around and silently name three things you see, two sounds you hear, and one thing you can feel (like the texture of your shirt).

* **Routine check‚Äëins** ‚Äì a quick journal entry or mood‚Äëtracker every few days can flag early warning signs before they snowball.

It‚Äôs not just about the acne; it‚Äôs the comfort of a little piece of privacy you‚Äôve grown used to.

One gentle way to ease the transition is to start small (or ‚Äúmask‚Äëfree‚Äù) moments where the stakes feel low‚Äîlike a quick coffee run or a walk around the block. Bring a lightweight scarf or a baseball cap you like; it gives you that extra layer of coverage without the full mask. Meanwhile, try a simple skincare routine (even just a good cleanser and moisturizer) so you feel more confident in the skin you‚Äôre showing.  

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to lean on the mask a bit while you rebuild that confidence‚Äîyou‚Äôre not ‚Äúdependent,‚Äù you‚Äôre just giving yourself time to feel comfortable again. üå±üíõ","

Now that the test is behind you, you might still notice the nervous flutter when you‚Äôre behind the wheel. A few things that helped me (and many others) keep that anxiety in check:

1. **Treat each drive as practice, not performance.** Focus on the task‚Äîchecking mirrors, staying in lane‚Äîrather than on who‚Äôs watching.  
2. **Set small, realistic goals.** Maybe a short solo run to the grocery store, then a longer road trip once you feel comfortable.

l3x18k,Anxiety,I (f22) negotiated with a car salesman by myself,phyllisdankworth,"2 years ago I couldn't go anywhere alone. I would pick up friends to come with me to the ATM with me because the thought of doing something like that alone stressed me out so much. I wouldn't order any takeout over the phone, wouldn't be in grocery store without someone else and I couldn't go to work without having a few mini anxiety attacks a day.

Today I walked into a car dealership by myself, negotiated with a salesman  for 2 hours and got exactly what I wanted. 

Going into it I knew as a young girl that doesn't know much about vehicles, I would be a large target. I stuck to my guns, negotiated hard and got an insanely good deal. I called my dad a few times for advice, so I guess it wasn't completely me, but 1 or 2 years ago I could never imagine me even going into a place like that even with someone else, nevermind having the guts to go by myself and  haggle someone so hard. I had the option of my boyfriend accompanying me, but I chose to go solo.

I'm just really proud of myself. It was the first time I have ever done something like that. I feel like I've gained more confidence in myself, and doing something so out of my comfort zone has made me feel like I can push myself to do a lot more things than I think I can do.",982,37,1611484033,"If you called your dad for advice mid-negotiation I think you deserve an extra bit of praise - 'cause that's hard to do.

Being able to put a stop to it, get your phone out and give your dad a call -twice- is impressive.",195,ThyRosen,,0,,"Wow, that‚Äôs huge‚Äîyou‚Äôve taken a massive step forward!‚ÄØIt‚Äôs easy to underestimate how much courage it takes to walk into a dealership solo when everyday life feels like a minefield of anxiety. The fact that you stuck to your plan, called your dad for a quick sanity‚Äëcheck, and still held your ground shows you‚Äôve built a solid toolkit: preparation, a clear goal, and the willingness to ask for help when you need it.

If you want to keep the momentum going, try breaking future challenges into the same three parts: research (know your numbers), a ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù (a quick call or text to someone you trust), and a set limit on how long you‚Äôll stay before walking away. Each win reinforces the next, and you‚Äôll find the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù worries shrinking over time. Proud of you‚Äîkeep riding that confidence wave!","

If you‚Äôre looking for ways to keep building that momentum, try a quick ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù routine between classes‚Äîlike naming three things you can see, hear, and feel.

I hope your journey gets better and if you ever want to talk about it more feel free to hit me up!,40,bullchild,"First off, huge kudos to you‚Äîwalking into a restaurant alone and actually finishing your meal is a massive step, especially when choking anxiety has been hanging over you for years. It makes total sense that the fear can hijack even a simple bite; our bodies get wired to protect the airway, so the brain can over‚Äëreact when it feels any ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù  

If you want to keep building on this momentum, try breaking the next outings into tiny, manageable pieces: pick a place you already know, sit at the counter (so you can see the kitchen), or order a dish you‚Äôve eaten at home before. Practice a quick grounding technique‚Äîslow, diaphragmatic breaths before each bite, or a gentle ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe, I can swallow‚Äù mantra.  

Consider pairing these exposure steps with a therapist who knows about choking phobia; CBT or exposure therapy can give you structured tools. And remember, every plate you finish, even a tiny one, is proof you‚Äôre reclaiming control. Keep celebrating those wins‚Äîyou‚Äôve earned them.","

POST TITLE: Today I ate in a restaurant by myself

POST BODY: I‚Äôve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I‚Äôve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I‚Äôm in company I‚Äôm comfortable with, I‚Äôll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I‚Äôm going to choke on every mouthful. I‚Äôve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù I‚Äôm not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate. It was overwhelmingly liberating, I could have cried. It wasn‚Äôt easy to eat but I finished my plate and I‚Äôve never been more proud of myself.

js3qdw,Anxiety,"You turned me into this, FUCK school. FUCK school, FUCK school. FUCK school",CookieSlammer9,"The amounts of hatred I have towards school is immesurable. IT made me into what I am. IT gave me HUGE amounts of COMPLETELY UNECESSARY anxiety and depression. IT gave me computer and porn addictions when I was completely hopeless. IT gave me such a LOW self-esteem that I will probably never recover. IT made me a cynical bastard who feels only pity towards my hopeful and youthful self that doesn't exist anymore. IT ruined me and my psyche.

I never had enough money for therapy and my parents thought that I am crazy when I asked them about it. I never had a counsellor or anybody who could help me at school because NOBODY GIVES A FUCKING DAMN HERE. NOBODY but I could help myself in this, I feel so alone, I feel ruined and bent beyond fixing. I've thought of suicide many many times but I am strong enough to never do it. I've gone alone trough the inhuman coldness of the education system and everyone in it without hugs or anyone to tell me that it will all be ''alright''. I don't have any friends at all. I wish I could cry but i've been taught to ''man up'' and soak up all the feelings, I wish I could let it all out. So here I am letting it out.

I have a learning disability called Dysgraphia and everyone has blamed it for my mistake. No, it is not my mistake, it is just who i am. Nothing in school is easier with a learning disability.

If anyone is struggling. PLEASE look for help :(. I don't want any more human beings to be ruined by this POISON like I have.

A couple things that might help:

1. **Give yourself permission to be imperfect.** Small pauses, ‚Äúuh‚Äëm‚Äëhms,‚Äù or brief silences are normal. You don‚Äôt have to fill every gap with a witty line.  
2. **Practice low‚Äëstakes conversation.** Chat with a barista, a roommate, or an online community about something you enjoy. The goal isn‚Äôt to be perfect, just to notice that most people aren‚Äôt judging you as harshly as you think.  
3. **Consider a quick check‚Äëin with a therapist or counselor.** Even a brief session can help untangle whether ADHD, anxiety, or a mix of factors is at play, and they can suggest coping tools.

Remember: you‚Äôre not alone, and you‚Äôre already doing the hard work by reflecting on this. Be kind to yourself‚Äîyou deserve that same patience you‚Äôd give a friend.","

A couple of tips that might make the experience even smoother: keep a backup payment method handy (some machines can be picky about chip cards), and if an item won‚Äôt scan, a quick ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù to a nearby employee usually resolves it faster than wrestling with the scanner yourself.

How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‚Äòt feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‚Äòm shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‚Äòm crying and even if they were awake they couldn‚Äòt help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.

Anxiety can feel like a vacuum that swallows any sense of connection‚Äî even when someone is physically there, the panic is a private storm that no one else can fully step into.  

A few things that have helped me (and many others) when the loneliness hits hard:  

1. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 (name five things you see, four you can touch, etc.) pulls your brain out of the spiral and into the present moment.  
2. **Write it down** ‚Äì a quick journal entry or even a text to a trusted friend can externalize the fear, making it feel less like it‚Äôs trapped inside you.  
3. **Scheduled ‚Äúworry time‚Äù** ‚Äì set a 10‚Äëminute slot each day to worry; when anxiety pops up outside that window, remind yourself you‚Äôll deal with it later.  
4. **Professional help** ‚Äì a therapist can teach you CBT or exposure techniques that target the root of the fear, and medication can be a useful bridge.

A couple things that helped me:

1. **Shift the focus** ‚Äì Instead of asking ‚ÄúWill they think I‚Äôm cringey?‚Äù ask ‚ÄúWhat do I want to say or do?‚Äù When you‚Äôre intent on the content rather than the reaction, the anxiety drops.

2. **Get a reality check** ‚Äì Share a joke or story with one trusted friend first. If they laugh, you‚Äôve got proof you‚Äôre not universally cringey. If they don‚Äôt, ask for specific feedback; it‚Äôs easier to improve on concrete points than vague ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cringey‚Äù vibes.

3. **Practice self‚Äëcompassion** ‚Äì Notice the inner critic (‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never be good enough‚Äù) and counter it with a kinder voice (‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning, and that‚Äôs okay‚Äù). Over time the critic loses its volume.

8xlqik,Anxiety,Guys‚Äîfor the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,breadplane,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there‚Äôs no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like ‚Äúoh no you don‚Äôt!‚Äù I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy‚Äînamely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I‚Äôm so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you‚Äôve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this!

Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less.

how good is anxiety",948,58,1567078089,Taking a mental health day is harder than people think!,171,smokeweedeatpussy,,0,,"I hear you‚Äîwhen anxiety is already buzzing, the extra pressure of ‚Äúhaving to call in sick‚Äù can feel like a mountain you can‚Äôt climb, so you end up pushing through anyway. That just eats away at your energy even more, especially on so little sleep.

A couple of things that have helped me in similar moments:

1. **Make the call a tiny habit.** Write a short script (‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not feeling well and need to rest today‚Äù) and keep it somewhere you can copy‚Äëpaste. When the anxiety spikes, you can just hit send instead of having to improvise.

2. **Give yourself permission to be human.** Taking a sick day isn‚Äôt ‚Äúlazy‚Äù; it‚Äôs self‚Äëcare that prevents burnout. Remind yourself that you‚Äôre protecting your ability to show up later, not abandoning responsibilities.

3. **Micro‚Äëself‚Äëcare during the day.** Even five minutes of deep breathing, a quick walk, or a glass of water can reset the nervous system enough to make the next task feel doable.

et1xah,Anxiety,does anyone get anxious around the noise of yelling?,trippyhippie_,"i always have a fear of loud yelling even if it‚Äôs not directly at me, i don‚Äôt have a fear of loud noises at all but if it‚Äôs yelling it‚Äôs different. it sends me into panic and overthinking. i‚Äôve been though traumatic things growing up so maybe that‚Äôs it,or does anyone else feel this way too with their anxiety.",881,124,1579823956,I also feel this way and believe it is largely related to my anxiety.,132,beantoes,I also feel this way and believe it is largely related to my anxiety.,132,beantoes,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs weird how the *type* of sound can be way more triggering than the volume itself. Yelling often carries a sense of aggression or danger, so for someone who‚Äôs experienced trauma it can instantly flip a ‚Äújust loud‚Äù reaction into a full‚Äëblown panic response. You‚Äôre not alone; many people with anxiety or PTSD have very specific auditory triggers.

A few things that might help:

1. **Grounding** ‚Äì When you hear yelling, try a quick 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory check (name things you see, hear, feel, etc.) to pull yourself back into the present.  
2. **Desensitization** ‚Äì In a safe setting, slowly expose yourself to recorded raised voices at low volume, gradually increasing as you feel comfortable.  
3. **Self‚Äëtalk** ‚Äì Remind yourself that the yelling isn‚Äôt aimed at you and that you‚Äôre safe right now.  
4. **Professional support** ‚Äì A therapist familiar with trauma‚Äëinformed CBT or EMDR can help re‚Äëwire that association.

Give yourself permission to feel uneasy, and take small steps toward reclaiming those moments.","

A couple of things that helped me break the cycle:

1. **Set a tiny time‚Äëlimit.** Give yourself 2‚Äì3‚ÄØminutes to draft a quick reply, then ‚Äúsend‚Äù it even if it‚Äôs not perfect. The goal is momentum, not polish.  
2. **Batch‚Äëprocess.** Pick a specific time of day (maybe after lunch) to clear all pending messages. Knowing you have a dedicated slot removes the ‚Äúalways‚Äëon‚Äù pressure.  
3. **Normalize the delay.** Most people understand that life gets busy‚Äîif you‚Äôre late, a brief ‚ÄúSorry for the delay, was swamped!‚Äù is usually enough.

2. **Gentle warm compresses** or a warm shower before bed can relax the masseter muscles.  
3. **Night‚Äëtime routine:** try a short progressive‚Äëmuscle‚Äërelaxation or breathing exercise right before you sleep‚Äîtraining your body to let go of tension.  
4. **Hydration & magnesium:** low magnesium can contribute to muscle tightness; a supplement or magnesium‚Äërich foods (nuts, leafy greens) might make a difference.

ca8lmg,Anxiety,Anyone else‚Äôs anxiety make them doubt/ second guess every choice they make/ made?,minookitty,I feel like my anxiety casts every decision I made or make into doubt. For example recently I quit a job for another job. I really did not like the job I quit and was stressed and unhappy all the time and job hunting for nearly the whole time I was there. There were real reasons why it was dysfunctional but my anxiety makes it so I can‚Äôt tell what was me and what was it. was I overly sensitive and bothered about things other people would have been ok with? Now the new job is causing me that same tick tick stress and dislike that I can‚Äôt compartmentalize and I feel like maybe the whole change was for nothing. Like I can‚Äôt tell where my anxiety stops and real feelings begin,953,49,1562516464,"It took me far too long to leave my previous toxic job for partially this reason - I couldn't tell if the constant feeling of failure was me being overly sensitive to the ""feedback"" I was being given or if it was valid and I was terrible at my job.  When the so-called feedback turned into what seemed more verbal abuse, it still took months to leave.  My coworkers and family tried to hard to make me see that this wasn't right but my brain didn't want to accept it.  It's always been hard for me to believe that my feelings are real and valid.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now, several years after I finally left that cesspool, I still wonder if it was just me being too sensitive and if I should have stuck it out longer.",52,ardhrianna,"Is it the job that makes you feel stressed or the people around you? I had similar issues but then I realized that what causes my stress were the people me. Try to find a job that you actually like doing and when people there starts to stress you out again, think about that you came there for the job and focus on finishing the task.",4,ValkyrieWuShen,"I hear you ‚Äì anxiety has a way of turning every ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù into a mental tug‚Äëof‚Äëwar, and it‚Äôs exhausting when you can‚Äôt tell where your true feelings end and the worry begins. A useful trick is to separate the *facts* from the *feel‚Äëings*: write down concrete reasons you left the old job (e.g., toxic manager, no growth, constant overtime) and then list the concrete aspects of the new role that are actually bothering you. When you can see the objective points, the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù chatter loses some of its power.

It also helps to give yourself permission to feel uneasy for a short period ‚Äì change is stressful for anyone ‚Äì but set a timer (say, two weeks). After that, evaluate whether the discomfort is still tied to specific, solvable issues or just the lingering anxiety. If it‚Äôs the former, you can take concrete steps; if it‚Äôs the latter, consider coping tools (mindfulness, CBT worksheets, or a therapist) to quiet the noise.

You‚Äôre not ‚Äúover‚Äësensitive‚Äù; you‚Äôre navigating a tough transition while anxiety amplifies every doubt. Be kind to yourself, focus on the tangible evidence, and remember that it‚Äôs okay to reassess and adjust as you go. You","

cqhkc3,Anxiety,I brushed my teeth!,littlemonsteress,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved.",924,75,1565824368,"That's a great habit to get into. Keep it up, I'm rooting for you!",131,Nwsamurai,"Grats and keep it up. Dental health is extremely important. Look into a waterpik, flossing is importsnt as well.",24,Woopdaddy12,"Hey, first off ‚Äì huge congratulations! üéâ‚ÄØIt takes a lot of courage to push through depression and anxiety enough to take that first step for yourself, and you‚Äôve just done it.  

A couple of quick tips that might help keep the momentum going:  
1. **Keep the routine simple.** Your Alarmy reminder is brilliant ‚Äì you could also pair brushing with something you already do (like a morning coffee) so it becomes a habit cue.  
2. **Don‚Äôt stress about perfection.** If you miss a session, just get back to it; the teeth don‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù one missed day.  
3. **Track progress.** A quick photo of your smile every week can be a motivating visual of how far you‚Äôve come.  

Remember, self‚Äëcare isn‚Äôt just about the teeth; it‚Äôs a signal to yourself that you‚Äôre worth the effort. Keep celebrating these wins, and be gentle with yourself on the tougher days. You‚Äôve got this! üåü","

Try to pause and ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat evidence do I actually have that people dislike me?‚Äù Often the answer is ‚Äúnothing concrete,‚Äù just a feeling.

If it feels safe, reach out to one person you trust and share a snippet of what‚Äôs going on. Sometimes just being heard can break the cycle of self‚Äëcriticism. Meanwhile, small self‚Äëcare habits‚Äîlike journaling the moments, getting outside for a few minutes, or setting a tiny, doable goal‚Äîcan give you proof that you‚Äôre still capable and valued. If these thoughts keep spiraling, consider talking to a therapist or counselor; they‚Äôre trained to help untangle these patterns. You‚Äôre not alone, even when it feels that way. Hang in there.","

misgxt,Anxiety,Is it normal to feel physical symptoms of anxiety even if you are not mentally anxious about anything particular?,danisomi,"I‚Äôve been feeling the common physical symptoms of anxiety but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it, and it‚Äôs been persistent for a week. 

I also have bad health anxiety so maybe focusing on it has been making me feel weird. I‚Äôm not sure. 

Does anyone else get random heat palpitations, the need to take big breaths and do breathing exercises, and also the feeling of not wanting to do anything? 

I contacted my doctor cause the heart palpitations and the need for breathing exercises usually happen at night.  
But I have to wait two weeks to have a 10 min phone call with my doctor. 

The only times I‚Äôve ever felt this way were times when I was having such bad anxiety, but I don‚Äôt recall the heart palpitations. 

But like I said, I don‚Äôt have reasons to be THIS anxious.. unless I just don‚Äôt realize that I am actually this anxious.

Has anyone else experience this?",846,150,1617394131,The physical symptoms can be ongoing even when feeling not anxious. It sucks. My physical symptoms have lasted for months even today.

A few things that often help while you wait for the doctor:  

1. **Grounding/box breathing** ‚Äì inhale 4‚ÄØsec, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. It gives the vagus nerve a gentle reset without over‚Äëthinking.  
2. **Check basics** ‚Äì limit caffeine after noon, stay hydrated, and aim for a consistent bedtime routine (warm shower, dim lights).  
3. **Journaling** ‚Äì write down any subtle stressors, diet changes, or meds; patterns sometimes emerge that feel ‚Äúrandom‚Äù at first.  

It‚Äôs also completely normal for health‚Äëanxious folks to experience these loops. If the palpitations get worse or you develop chest pain, seek urgent care, but otherwise","

If you can, try small, low‚Äëstakes connections: a hobby group, a class, or even an online community focused on something you love.

Remember, you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything overnight. One kind word, one shared laugh, or even a virtual hug can be a step toward the community you deserve.

cc7boe,Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,symph0nica,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",915,79,1562913742,All the time.

Try giving yourself permission to have *intentional* downtime.

One gentle way to start reclaiming that part of you is to give yourself small, anxiety‚Äëfree experiments. Pick an activity you loved before the anxiety ramped up‚Äîmaybe drawing, playing a game, or just hanging out with a close friend‚Äî and do it for just five minutes, with the agreement that you‚Äôll stop if it feels too much.

Also consider a therapist or a CBT‚Äëbased app; they can help you untangle the thoughts that keep you stuck and teach you tools to notice when anxiety is hijacking your sense of self.

Anxiety people are very sensitive to the way our brain chemistry runs that's why every little thing makes a too big impression and overwhelms you. When you work against things that trigger anxiety you become ""stronger"" against it in the same way that being good at playing guitar gives you harder fingertips. You gear up the body better for it, and cold is a similar sensation, because it over-over-stimulates the nerves and makes you less sensitive to further sensation for a while.",11,linkenski,"I totally get it‚Äîbeing stuck in a cramped freezer can feel like a sudden ‚Äúreset‚Äù button for a racing mind. The cold stimulates the vagus nerve, which can slow your heart rate and give your body a cue to shift into a calmer state, and the quiet, solitary, makes it easier to focus on your breath.

If you can‚Äôt always duck into a walk‚Äëin freezer, try some safer ‚Äúcold‚Äëreset‚Äù tricks: splash cold water on your face, run a cold shower for a minute, or hold an ice cube while you do a few deep‚Äëinhale/slow‚Äëexhale cycles.

Keep experimenting, and if anxiety feels overwhelming, consider pairing these tricks with therapy or medication adjustments‚Äîsometimes a combination works best. You‚Äôve already found a useful tool; now you just need a few more in the toolbox. Hang in there!","

p0f05h,Anxiety,I GOT THE FIRST DOSE OF MY VACCINE!,breathingnitrogen,"Got it a little over two hours ago and I'm really happy.
I struggled with the idea of taking it because all the possible side effects had my hypochondriac mind on edge but when my dad asked me if I wanted to get it today I said yes on the spur of the moment, and then followed through.

1. **Track it** ‚Äì Keep a simple log of temperature, soreness, sleep, and mood for the next 48‚ÄØhours. Seeing the actual numbers can calm the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù thoughts.

I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety?

A few things that helped me (and many other former prodigies) are:

1. **Re‚Äëframe the narrative** ‚Äì think of yourself as a learner, not a performer. Your brain is still capable, it just needs different tools (spaced‚Äërepetition, active recall, shorter study blocks) rather than the effortless recall you relied on before.  
2. **Normalize struggle** ‚Äì everyone in grad school or research hits roadblocks. The ‚Äúgifted‚Äù label can make it feel personal, so remind yourself that difficulty is part of the process, not proof of inadequacy.

Please tell.,0,dare_acoustic,"I hear you ‚Äì that feeling of‚ÄØ‚Äúhere we go again‚Äù‚ÄØcan be crushing, especially when the anxiety is already humming in the background. It‚Äôs normal to feel exhausted by the endless loop of stress, and it doesn‚Äôt make you weak or lazy for wishing for a breather.

One thing that‚Äôs helped many people is carving out a tiny ‚Äúreset‚Äù ritual, even if it‚Äôs only 5‚Äì10 minutes. A short walk, a grounding breathing exercise, or simply turning off work‚Äërelated notifications for a half‚Äëhour can give your nervous system a chance to shift gears. Over time, those micro‚Äëbreaks add up and make the whole day feel a bit shorter.

Also, try writing down one concrete thing you want to tackle tomorrow before bed. Getting it out of your head can reduce that ‚Äúwalking straight into‚Äù anxiety and give you a tiny sense of control. You‚Äôre not alone in this, and taking small, intentional steps can gradually loosen the grip of that perpetual stress. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this.","

But I can understand where these people are coming from and as yet another example of a child who had to take care of her mother, I just have to stand up for these people offering these words of caution. 

You've shared this story as a heartwarming, positive tale. And it is. Sort of. There's a lot of people commenting who are basically taking this as something to strive for in their relationships with their children, and that's the issue here. The people who are offering criticisms are just trying to make it loud and clear that while yes, it's sweet that your child offered you comfort, it's also a dangerous trend to set. I can't speak to how your child felt but I'd expect that most would feel a little scared by seeing their parent in such a state. You've made it very clear that you usually shield him from that, we've heard that loud and clear. 

But *in general* it should really be known that this is not a good road to go down. I really think that's all the naysayers are trying to get across, so please try not to take it as an attack.

Your calm breathing, the simple act of sitting down, gave him a cue that you were ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and safe, so he instinctively came over to offer comfort.

A couple of things that might help for next time: keep a few easy‚Äëto‚Äëgrab sensory tools (a soft blanket, a chewable necklace, a small stuffed animal) nearby so you can hand one to him while you focus on your breath. Also, try a quick ‚Äúcheck‚Äëin‚Äù routine‚Äîname the feeling, take three slow breaths together, then return to whatever you were doing.

The exhaustion does make it easier to nod off, but it also trains your brain to associate bedtime with stress, which can keep the cycle going.

**A few things that might help:**

1. **Set a consistent wind‚Äëdown window** ‚Äì 30‚Äì60‚ÄØminutes before you actually want to be asleep, turn off screens, dim the lights, and do something low‚Äëkey (reading, gentle stretches, a short journal entry). This signals to your body that it‚Äôs time to relax, not cram.

2. **Chunk your work** ‚Äì Break study material into 25‚Äëminute blocks (Pomodoro) with 5‚Äëminute breaks. Knowing you‚Äôll have a break reduces the urge to ‚Äújust keep going until I‚Äôm dead tired.‚Äù

3. **Address the racing thoughts** ‚Äì A quick brain‚Äëdump (write down everything that‚Äôs nagging you) can offload anxiety, and you can revisit the list later.

4. **Talk to someone** ‚Äì Campus counseling","

mrc66q,Anxiety,Don‚Äôt trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn‚Äôt always right.,nebulouspeach,"Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I‚Äôm still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I‚Äôve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly.

I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a ‚Äúshout out‚Äù because I handled the tough questions ‚Äúlike a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.‚Äù She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù he‚Äôd seen and he‚Äôd found it ‚Äúextremely useful and insightful‚Äù. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else‚Äôs. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

A useful trick is to treat anxiety as a ‚Äúcoach‚Äù that‚Äôs trying to keep you safe, not as a truth‚Äëteller. After a big moment, write down three concrete pieces of feedback you actually received (like the email you got) and compare them to the scary story your mind was spinning.

Also, give yourself credit for the preparation and the willingness to sit with discomfort ‚Äì those are the real growth points. Keep collecting those ‚Äúwin‚Äù emails, and let them quiet the inner voice next time. You‚Äôve got this!","

eebgko,Anxiety,Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,ClearBlue_Grace,"It‚Äôs a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It‚Äôs not a stomachache, or cramping, or ‚Äúmaybe I ate something bad‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I‚Äôve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it‚Äôs likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn‚Äôt change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don‚Äôt even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don‚Äôt need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I‚Äôm just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn‚Äôt going to fix it. No, I can‚Äôt just ‚Äústop worrying‚Äù, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don‚Äôt help.",827,155,1577054209,"Yeah, same.

My husband doesnt have anxiety and I told him I feel like I'm going down hill on a roller coaster....all the time. It's awful.",106,blc1234,"I hear you.‚ÄØWhen anxiety hijacks the gut it can feel like your body is literally trying to ‚Äúspill its guts,‚Äù and that kind of nausea is its own cruel distraction.‚ÄØThe gut has its own nervous system (the vagus nerve), so stress can crank up acid, slow digestion, and trigger that que‚Äëlike queasiness you describe‚Äîwithout any food poisoning or cramps.

It‚Äôs completely valid to feel exhausted by a symptom that never seems to ‚Äúgo away‚Äù just because you‚Äôre trying to stay positive.‚ÄØOne thing that sometimes helps is giving the nervous system a tiny, low‚Äëstakes reset: a few slow, diaphragmatic breaths or a 30‚Äësecond ‚Äúground‚Äëand‚Äëfocus‚Äù pause (notice three things you can see, hear, feel). It doesn‚Äôt cure the anxiety, but it can short‚Äëcircuit the gut‚Äëbrain alarm long enough to finish a meeting or walk into a social event.

If you ever feel like the nausea is getting out of control, a quick check‚Äëin with a medical professional (just to rule out IBS, reflux, etc.) can be reassuring.","

a0k03f,Anxiety,A cool anxiety technique I learned,theWinterDojer,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!",904,75,1543244207,Love this.   And testing the theory ,65,palmcitytiki,Thanks!  I'm willing to try just about anything. ,2,NiceIce,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from ‚Äì anxiety can feel like a fuzzy, hard‚Äëto‚Äëpin‚Äëdown thing, so giving it a shape or a face makes it a lot more manageable. I‚Äôve tried the ‚Äúcolor‚Äëswap‚Äù version yourself and it really does help my brain treat the feeling as something you can edit rather than a permanent state.

A couple of things that have complemented this visual trick for me:

* **Box‚Äëbreathing** (4‚Äë4‚Äë4‚Äë4) right after you ‚Äúshrink‚Äù the object grounds the new, calmer image with a physical rhythm.  
* **Grounding 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1** ‚Äì naming things you see, hear, feel, etc., reinforces that you‚Äôre still present while the anxiety‚Äëball rolls away.  
* **Micro‚Äëmovement** ‚Äì a quick shoulder roll or a few gentle neck stretches can release the tension that often ‚Äúholds‚Äù the visual.

Keep experimenting ‚Äì sometimes swapping the shape for a gentle ripple of water works better, or turning the anxiety into a cloud that drifts off. The key is that you‚Äôve already proved you can influence it, and that‚Äôs huge. Good luck, and keep smiling!","

cfbfvy,Anxiety,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,dumbjokes101,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months.

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

POST TITLE: First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend

POST BODY: My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face.

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles.

or3og2,Anxiety,I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,BeginningIcy3816,"It‚Äôs so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It‚Äôs just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I‚Äôve made immense progress but it‚Äôs never going to be normal again. I can‚Äôt stop feeling guilty for everything I‚Äôve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I‚Äôm worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can‚Äôt let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn‚Äôt even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I‚Äôm tired of thoughts that I‚Äôm a horrible person. I‚Äôm just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I‚Äôm in a group of people having fun. And I‚Äôm able to make them laugh. Whenever I‚Äôm alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I‚Äôm worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there‚Äôs gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It‚Äôs just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I‚Äôm kinda thinking this might be because I‚Äôve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I‚Äôm so nervous I can‚Äôt stop hyper focusing on one situation and it‚Äôs been a year and it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal when it happened

You have anxiety. Your brain is lying to you, but you don't know that in the moment. I've been there. I thought those thoughts were normal. I thought it was normal to constantly think others were talking about me. I thought it was normal to relive conversations from years ago. I thought it was normal to constantly worry about whether my boyfriend (now husband) actually loved me.

The only thing that truly helped was medication. A daily med as well as a rescue med for anxiety attacks. The right meds and the right dosage made a world of difference for me. The vast majority of those thoughts stopped or were at least easier to manage. I'm currently off medication and doing well, but there is no shame in medication.",108,readrunrescue,[deleted],14,[deleted],"I hear you‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting to live on ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù mode, constantly scanning for signs that someone‚Äôs mad.‚ÄØIt sounds like the anxiety meds you‚Äôve been taking helped keep that volume down, and missing a few days can let the worry flood back in.  

A couple things that might help you break the cycle:

1. **Practice ‚Äúuncertainty tolerance.‚Äù** When you notice the urge to check if someone blocked you, set a timer (e.g., 5‚ÄØminutes) and deliberately postpone the check. Over time you‚Äôll train your brain that you can survive the unknown without catastrophizing.

2. **Self‚Äëcompassion scripts.** When guilt pops up, try saying out loud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay.‚ÄØI made a mistake, but I‚Äôm still a decent person.‚Äù Writing these statements in a journal can make them feel more real.

3. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì focus on five","

g0ging,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when thinking about time wasting?,Pinksloth1995,I feel like I'm rushing the day and wasting my own time as we don't have all day and it ends up getting me upset and anxious that I've wasted time it's like I've got to plan something at a certain time so can make the most out of my day but it's making me anxious about time,916,61,1586774309,I'm tired of this feeling. But sometimes I just want to do nothing. I'm tired of feeling like I have to catch up or move ahead in some race all the time. Life is just not enjoyable when I'm constantly running on anxiety.,117,MagicCandy,,0,,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from‚Äîthere‚Äôs that nagging voice that says ‚Äúyou should be doing something productive right now,‚Äù and it can turn even a relaxed afternoon into a source of stress. First, remember that ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù is often just our brain‚Äôs way of flagging moments where we‚Äôre not meeting a self‚Äëimposed schedule, not an objective measure of value. Try treating those gaps as intentional ‚Äúreset‚Äù periods rather than lost minutes; a short walk, a coffee break, or even day‚Äëdreaming can actually boost creativity and focus later.

A simple trick that‚Äôs helped me is the ‚Äútwo‚Äëminute rule‚Äù: if a task will take less than two minutes, just do it, then schedule larger blocks for deeper work. Also, set a loose ‚Äúflexible‚Äù goal for the day (e.g., ‚Äúfinish X‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbe busy all day‚Äù) and give yourself permission to have unstructured time without guilt. You‚Äôre not racing against the clock‚Äîyou‚Äôre shaping a day that feels good for you. Hang in there; it‚Äôs a habit to unlearn, but it‚Äôs doable.","

First things first: try to hydrate with water (or a calming herbal tea) and do some slow, deep breathing or a grounding exercise (e.g., 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1). If the shaking persists or you feel faint, don‚Äôt hesitate to call a friend or seek medical help ‚Äì it‚Äôs better to be safe.

jb4pzf,Anxiety,I finally talked to my doctor about anxiety -he told me to try a meditation app.,FacelessOldWoman1234,"I've had anxiety for years and it's been getting worse and worse. Finally I got up the courage to call my doctor. I told him everything, and went through some questionnaires with him.  He said I rank quite high on the scale, but that since I had never tried a particular mindfulness app, we should start there and talk again in a month.   I even told him that I had tried exercise and mindfulness but have never been able to make a habit out of this (because anxiety, obv.) I told him that I am not sleeping enough and it is interfering in my ability to live my life and parent my kids, and he said ""6 hours a night is within the range of normal."" 

I feel really discouraged.

Edit: Thank you for the perspective, advice, and support. I think that those of you who suggested that the doctor is just starting at the bottom of the treatment ladder are correct. I have otherwise had good experiences with this doctor, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I do think however that he could have done better than just suggest I use a different app to do something I already indicated wasn't working. It felt really dismissive, and sent me down a bit of a spiral. I will try again (although I already worry I'll just fail at it and it will be one more failure for the books), and I'll work on my sleep hygiene myself. Again, thank you for the support.",735,242,1602695049,"That sucks, and I can see why you don't feel listened to.

Giving the app a go might not be a bad idea.

You're within your rights to ask for another opinion, from a different doctor. Even if 6 hours of sleep is deemed normal, it is still affecting your wellbeing and should therefore be taken seriously.

You deserve to have your concerns heard and treated as important.",308,meekomania,Any doctor that says 6 hours of sleep a night is enough is not educated enough to hold the title of doctor imo. I would seek a second opinion from a doctor that knows what they are doing,6,pritch_dawg,"I hear you‚Äîit‚Äôs frustrating when you finally open up about something that‚Äôs been weighing on you for years and the response feels like a brush‚Äëoff.‚ÄØYour doctor isn‚Äôt wrong that 6‚ÄØhours can be ‚Äúwithin normal,‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt make the impact on your mood, energy, or parenting any less real.  

Think of the meditation app as a *tool*, not the whole solution. If habit‚Äëforming has been hard, start ultra‚Äësmall: a 1‚Äëminute ‚Äúbody scan‚Äù right after you brush your teeth, or a guided breathing break while you‚Äôre waiting for the kettle. Pair¬†‚Äî‚ÄØpair the practice with something you already do consistently, so the cue is built‚Äëin.  

Also, give sleep a concrete plan: dim lights an hour before bed, keep phones out of the bedroom, and try a short wind‚Äëdown routine (reading, gentle stretches, or a warm shower). If these tweaks don‚Äôt move the needle, it‚Äôs absolutely reasonable to ask your doctor about therapy (CBT‚ÄëI) or medication options. You deserve a treatment plan that actually moves you forward, not just another app suggestion. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôve already taken a huge step by speaking up.","

hn7wgd,Anxiety,"Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an ""event""...ANY event?",Cautious-Discount,"Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?",917,60,1594172541,[deleted],102,[deleted],Would you care to talk about how you cope with your anxiety?,1,cleverbeavercleaver,"I hear you ‚Äì that knot in your gut that shows up right before anything that feels ‚Äúimportant,‚Äù even when the event is as low‚Äëkey (or unwanted) as a birthday. It‚Äôs a classic mix of anticipatory anxiety and the body‚Äôs fight‚Äëor‚Äëflight response, and it can masquerade as excitement, dread, or just a vague ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs off.‚Äù  

A few things that help:

1. **Name the feeling** ‚Äì simply acknowledging ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling a tight chest and a sinking stomach‚Äù can reduce its power.  
2. **Ground yourself** ‚Äì a few deep breaths, 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory grounding, or a quick stretch can calm the nervous system.  
3. **Check the narrative** ‚Äì ask yourself what you‚Äôre really worried about (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat if today feels like a reminder I‚Äôm getting older?‚Äù). Reframing the thought often eases the physical reaction.  
4. **Small self‚Äëcare** ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt want a celebration, doing something you *enjoy* (a favorite song, a walk, a coffee) can turn the ‚Äúevent‚Äù","

POST TITLE: My anxiety always makes me delete all of my reddit posts and comments.

POST BODY: I'm always scared that I might've accidentally done something wrong, dumb, or offensive, or someone that knows me in real life might find my account and realize that they know me. People are scary and I don't want to deal with any of that. I just post on reddit if I need to vent my emotions or get help on something, then I delete it. I feel bad for deleting them though because other people put effort into helping me or other people might find the post useful, but the anxiety is just too much for me to handle.

This post is probably gonna be deleted soon too so... see ya

Edit: i just woke up and was surprised to see all the loving support, thank you all :) it made me feel less anxious

Edit2: maybe i wont delete it idk :) you all are really nice

A practical thing that helps me (and many others) is breaking the ‚Äúbig‚Äëpicture‚Äù worries into tiny, doable actions.

edx16n,Anxiety,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,DevilAngel9,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain &lt;3

Well done!",5,AHippyInLeeds,"Hey, first off ‚Äì huge congratulations on hitting the one‚Äëyear mark without self‚Äëharm. That‚Äôs massive, especially when you‚Äôve been fighting the same monsters for years. I totally get how the anxiety and the ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of me‚Äù feeling can make it feel impossible to ever be ‚Äúwell enough‚Äù for help.  

If you ever feel ready to dip a toe into therapy again, look for someone who specializes in DBT or trauma‚Äëinformed work ‚Äì they‚Äôre trained to meet you where you are without judgment.

Remember: progress isn‚Äôt a straight line. Some days will feel heavier, and that‚Äôs okay. Celebrate the small wins, lean on the friends who check in, and keep reminding yourself that you‚Äôre already proving how strong you are. Merry Christmas and keep taking care of yourself! üåü","

There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on.

If possible, let your boss know you‚Äôre dealing with mental‚Äëhealth stress and ask about flexible options (remote work, a mental‚Äëhealth day, or a brief check‚Äëin). Many companies are starting to recognize that supporting employees‚Äô wellbeing actually improves productivity.

If you ever feel the weight getting too big, try these small steps:  

1. **Reach out** ‚Äì a text, call, or even a quick ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of you‚Äù to a trusted friend, family member, or a crisis line (US:‚ÄØ988, UK:‚ÄØ111‚ÄØor Samaritans).  
2. **Ground yourself** ‚Äì focus on five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste. It can pull you out of the spiral.  
3. **Write it down** ‚Äì sometimes putting thoughts on paper helps you see patterns and gives a concrete place to share with a counselor later.  

Remember, you matter, and there are people (including us here) who genuinely want to listen. If you ever need to vent or just chat, drop a message ‚Äì we‚Äôre here. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

b2b1t3,Anxiety,Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,TheLittlestDandelion,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure. Do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?",851,115,1552862579,"I've recently become aware that I have an issue with competing noises or background noises.   They make me bonkers.  For example - if my kids are playing on a tablet and my husband has the TV on or if we're driving and listening to a podcast but someone is also trying to get to tell me something. Or if the baby starts crying while music is playing.

A few things that have helped me (and friends who are the same way):

1. **Gradual exposure** ‚Äì play recordings of the sounds you dread at a very low volume and slowly increase it over days or weeks. Pair it with something pleasant (a favorite podcast or a calming scent) so the brain starts to re‚Äëassociate the noise with safety.

2. **Grounding techniques** ‚Äì when a sound goes off, try the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 method (name five things you see, four you can‚Äôt‚ÄØ‚Ä¶ etc.) or press your feet into the floor and focus on your breath. It can break the ‚Äúfight‚Äëor‚Äëflight‚Äù loop.

3. **Protective earplugs** ‚Äì keeping a discreet pair in your bag or on a keychain lets you mute alarms, fireworks, or balloon bursts without feeling trapped.

4. **Talk it out** ‚Äì a therapist familiar with anxiety or sensory issues can help you","

You could also keep a small calming item (a scent‚Äëed sachet, a tiny stress ball) in the stall so you don‚Äôt have to rely on the toilet alone.

I'm fairly certain that my peers cope with these things just fine. But almost every time they happen to me my day is ruined and I have to constantly seek reassurance from people that everything is alright.

I find myself cringing about past interactions with people I consider to be friends MONTHS after that perceived awkward interaction. Some days are better than others, and some days are blissful. I try and repeat a positive mantra when those thoughts surface and remind myself that this is something I'm just learning to identify and work through, just like my students.",107,ParabenFree_,"yesterday I went into the livestream of one of my favorite animators and inspirations and tried to be friendly. he was working on rigging characters for his newest video, and since i had just got there and didnt know what was going on, i complimented him saying the characters were cute and asked him if it means there was going to be a video about them.

word for word, he says ""hmm HMM i don't know, i don't know, why would i spend 4 days rigging these puppets for animation? i'm just doing this awful tedious project for fun. i'm just gonna throw it in the trash when i'm done."" very sarcastically. his girlfriend who was also watching him (and was another artist i looked up to) chimed in as well with something sarcastic, and several people in the chat started making fun of me for asking such a stupid question. I tried to think of something cool to say, to brush it off and be tough, but all I could do was close the stream and leave.

One thing that‚Äôs helped me is to give the irritation a ‚Äútime‚Äëout‚Äù instead of trying to push it away.

Also, building a small ‚Äúreset kit‚Äù (music, a favorite quote, a short walk) you can pull out whenever you sense the day slipping can turn a ruin‚Äëous moment into just a brief speed bump.

POST BODY: School started today and I woke up with my heart beating like crazy. I could feel and hear the blood in my brain. Then I ate breakfast- threw it all up. On every break I had to go to the toilet (nausea, sorry if that's gross :/). I finished school- went to the shop with my mum. My heart was still beating very heavily and I felt dizzy. Additionally I got lost without a phone. The shop was huge and I was looking on the right and then to the left trying to spot my mom in the huge crowd of people. With every move of my head I felt more and more dizzy. I thought I was gonna either burst out crying or pass out. I didn't luckily. Just imagine, 17 years old man crying because he got lost in the shop- pathetic, but I was in such a bad state this day that it was really hard to keep myself at least a little bit rational. Well, I found her (yay :,)) I got back home but I am in such a bad state that I am not able to eat anything. I've tried but I feel like throwing up and my heart is still so loud. What shall I do? 

My mum doesn't know. I don't have any medicine.

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay!

A few practical things that might help while you‚Äôre waiting for your psychiatrist:

1. **Reach out for a temporary bridge** ‚Äì many clinics have an on‚Äëcall psychiatrist or a nurse practitioner who can give you a short‚Äëterm plan (sometimes a low‚Äëdose ‚Äústarter‚Äù of lamotrigine or a brief benzodiazepine burst) to get you through the next couple of weeks. A quick phone call or tele‚Äëvisit could save you a lot of stress.

2. **Ativan isn‚Äôt a contraindication** ‚Äì the pharmacist and nurse were right‚Äëon‚Äëtarget. A low dose before the vaccine can actually calm the anxiety and won‚Äôt interfere with the immune response.

3. **Self‚Äëcare hacks** ‚Äì stay hydrated, keep your arm elevated, use a cool compress for","

A few things that have helped others in a similar spot:  

1. **Rule‚Äëout medical issues** ‚Äì a basic blood panel, thyroid check, and vitamin D level can rule out obvious contributors, and it can be reassuring to know you‚Äôve covered that base.  
2. **Structured ‚Äúbrain‚Äëbreaks.‚Äù** Try a 5‚Äëminute grounding routine (deep breathing, naming 3 things you see, hear, feel) every few hours; it can interrupt the loop of rumination and give your brain a reset.

4. **Professional support.** A therapist trained in CBT or ACT can teach specific skills","

At the same time, anxiety can literally tighten the muscles around your scalp and neck, turning a mild tension into a persistent ache. Keeping a simple log‚Äîtime of day, stress levels, caffeine, sleep, meds‚Äîcan help you spot patterns and give both you and your doctors useful data.  

If the medical work‚Äëup stays negative, consider talking to a therapist about anxiety‚Äëfocused coping tools (CBT, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation). Treating the mind and the body together often breaks the feedback loop. You‚Äôve got this","

rjoobk,Anxiety,I‚Äôm graduating from my masters program and no one cares,ladymemedaddy,"So I‚Äôm graduating with my Masters at the end of December, but I finish classes in a few days. I also graduated college class of 2020 and spent my graduating sitting on my couch crying because I was so sad. I decided to try to let it go, since i would be getting a second graduation in a year and a half and most others didn‚Äôt. Now, it is my graduation and nobody cares. My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I‚Äôm happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn‚Äôt been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can‚Äôt even do that, and I don‚Äôt want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven‚Äôt been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don‚Äôt know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there‚Äôs nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it‚Äôs causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

First, give yourself permission to feel proud.‚ÄØA master‚Äôs degree isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúanother graduation‚Äù; it‚Äôs a whole year (or more) of focused effort, research, and growth.

Lastly, consider sharing the news in a way that invites acknowledgment ‚Äì a quick Instagram story, a group text, or a short note to family members. Sometimes people simply don‚Äôt realize how important it is to you until you tell them.

My sister is getting married the first weekend of January, so all the focus is on the wedding. I‚Äôm happy for her, but this is quite possibly the biggest accomplishment of my life and I feel like this wedding is completely overshadowing it. My sister and I already have a weird relationship, so this wedding hasn‚Äôt been the thing Im ~the most~ excited for, but it is still important to her. On top of this, no one in my family has said anything to me at all about my graduation. Mind you, she had an undergrad graduation and a law school graduation that my family flew out for both times. Since no one in my family was doing anything, I decided to just go out with my friends on new years, since that is the day I am an official graduate. However, because of rising covid cases, I can‚Äôt even do that, and I don‚Äôt want to force my friends to change their plans. I haven‚Äôt been this depressed or anxious about something in years and i just don‚Äôt know what to do. I talked to my parents and they feel bad but there‚Äôs nothing to do. Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far. Just needed to vent. 

TLDR- my sisters wedding is overshadowing my only graduation and it‚Äôs causing a lot of sadness and anxiety for me

Edit: I am blown away by the kindness of strangers who don‚Äôt even know me, but took the time to write something nice. Sending all of you virtual hugs‚ù§Ô∏è I am so appreciative of all your kind words

Edit 2: WOW! Thank you all so much for your comments! I spent the past 2 days crying with horrible anxiety, but waking up seeing all your comments and kindness really turned my day around. I wanted to take the time to respond to everyone individually since you were all kind enough comment. If I happened to miss your comment, I apologize, but I am so grateful and appreciative of every single one of you‚ù§Ô∏è

You proved to yourself that you have tools you can rely on‚Äîdeep breathing, grounding, and simply allowing the feeling to run its course.

When you start planning for future trips, consider a few extra ‚Äúsafety nets‚Äù:  
-‚ÄØCarry a small grounding kit (a textured stone, a scented lip balm, or a playlist you love) that you can reach for the moment the panic spikes.  
-‚ÄØTell a trusted friend or the driver (if you feel safe) that you have anxiety, so you have an external reminder you‚Äôre not alone.  
-‚ÄØPractice a quick ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù sensory exercise before boarding; it can help keep your nervous system anchored.

Keep sharing these victories with yourself and others‚Äîthey‚Äôre powerful proof that you‚Äôre moving forward. You‚Äôve got this, and the clinic will only add more strategies to your toolbox. üåü","

A few things that have helped others in the same boat:

* **Breathing retraining** ‚Äì paced‚Äëbox breathing or the 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 technique (inhale 4‚ÄØsec, hold 7, exhale 8) can break the cycle. Practicing a few minutes a day often makes the episodes less intense.

Having a few concrete coping tools (brief breathing exercises, a quick walk, or a pre‚Äëplanned script for meetings) can help you feel a bit more in control when the anxiety spikes.

If it was a chain, ask to speak to a manager about your interaction, because that is not customer service.

* If a pharmacist seems uncomfortable, politely ask to speak with the manager or another pharmacist; often a different staff member will have a clearer understanding of the rules.

iqahuc,Anxiety,Anyone else have their health issues brushed off by medical professionals due to an anxiety diagnosis?,Optimistic_Mute,"
Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance‚Äôs nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do.

POST TITLE: Anyone else have their health issues brushed off by medical professionals due to an anxiety diagnosis?

POST BODY: 
Kind of a vent post, but has anyone else had issues with people in the medical field brushing off symptoms of physical health issues because of an anxiety diagnosis or other mental health stuff in their health history? I had a really bad experience with it this week. 
On Monday morning around 3 am I called my insurance‚Äôs nurse advice line with ongoing complaints of a rash that was getting progressively worse, spreading throughout my body, and causing unbearable itching to the point where I was unable to sleep for the second night in a row. I called the advice line for guidance on next steps on what to do. I was transferred to a male nurse and told him my symptoms and he said something along the lines of ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow I‚Äôm seeing that you‚Äôre a 24 year old with anxiety and your symptoms just don‚Äôt fly with me as a nurse.‚Äù This comment made me feel ashamed for reaching out for medical care that I needed for symptoms that I knew were real.

Edit: Reading through all of the comments on this thread, I realized you‚Äôre right.  I called the dentist this morning and rescheduled my appointment to a few weeks from now.

If you‚Äôre struggling, try breaking down the routine even further: put on some calming music or a podcast you love, set a timer for two minutes, and just focus on the motion of the brush. Even a quick swipe is better than nothing, and the habit can become a small anchor in the day.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal.

For the body part, notice any subconscious movements (leg shaking, fidgeting) and give yourself a gentle cue to relax the muscles ‚Äì maybe a quick shoulder roll or a few shoulder‚Äëblade squeezes. Over time, those cues become automatic and your whole presence feels calmer.

One thing that helps many people is to separate the *physical* sensations from the story your mind is adding.

d0q8ly,Anxiety,The worst thing for me about having generalized anxiety is I have anxiety about my anxiety.,Sammichface,"I constantly feel the need to explain to people why I constantly over think or internalize everything. I don't want people to think I'm this crazy, narcissist that thinks the world revolves around me so I explain that I have pretty severe anxiety issues.... and then I worry that I'm that annoying person who constantly feels the need to justify their actions or statements by leaning heavily on a health issue.... so then I apologize for bringing it up so much. 

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think? Why do I worry so much about how I come across to others? It's exhausting.

One thing that‚Äôs helped many people is giving the anxiety a little distance: instead of trying to explain it every time, you can simply acknowledge it internally (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling anxious again‚Äù) and let it pass without the extra narrative.‚ÄØIf you do want to share, a brief ‚ÄúI tend to over‚Äëthink, so I‚Äôm working on that‚Äù is usually enough‚Äîmost folks will accept it without needing a full medical‚Äësounding rundown.

Also, try a quick grounding or ‚Äúworry‚Äëtime‚Äù exercise (set a 5‚Äëminute timer, write down the worries, then close the notebook). It trains the brain to contain the worry instead of letting it spill over into every interaction.

You‚Äôre not being a burden; you‚Äôre just human trying to cope. Give yourself permission to be imperfect, and remember that the people who matter will appreciate you for who you are, not for the explanations you give. Sending you","

Like I‚Äôve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

It‚Äôs so hard to put into words how I‚Äôm feeling. It‚Äôs like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can‚Äôt. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that‚Äôs consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There‚Äôs no trigger. There‚Äôs not single thing that starts it, because it‚Äôs a constant. It doesn‚Äôt ever stop. I‚Äôm currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I‚Äôm getting worse by the day. It‚Äôs like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I‚Äôm almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn‚Äôt have known that so many of you felt this way too.

First, know that you‚Äôre not ‚Äúbroken‚Äù or ‚Äúlost‚Äù because you‚Äôre changing. Trauma, chronic stress, or even the meds themselves can reshape how you experience yourself; it‚Äôs a common, albeit miserable, side‚Äëeffect. Keep sharing these feelings with both therapists ‚Äì sometimes the ‚Äúnothing makes sense‚Äù moment is a clue that the treatment plan needs tweaking (dosage, type of medication, or adding a trauma‚Äëfocused approach).  

In the meantime, try tiny ‚Äúre‚Äëconnect‚Äù rituals: pick one piece of your old life (like a song you used to love or a simple rhythm on a drum) and engage with it for just five minutes a day, no pressure to feel the same. Small, consistent actions can gradually rebuild a sense of ownership over your present.

8r7ozl,Anxiety,Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,ZexMurphy,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

fxyye3,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations?,mkh4990,"I (30M) definitely feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations. When it comes to group conversations, my anxiety levels go though the roof to the point where I can‚Äôt function properly.",857,84,1586460687,It's so much easier to focus on one person. When everyone starts talking I feel like I don't have time to process everything so instead I just tap out.,130,aandr0meda,,0,,"I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from ‚Äì I used to feel the same way. In a group setting the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù of multiple voices, the fear of saying something ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù and the sheer social pressure can crank anxiety up to eleven. One‚Äëon‚Äëone talks feel safer because you can focus on one person‚Äôs reactions and you don‚Äôt have to juggle several conversational threads at once.

A few things that have helped me:

1. **Prep a few go‚Äëto topics** ‚Äì having a couple of neutral, easy‚Äëgoing subjects in your back‚Äëpocket can ease the panic of ‚Äúwhat do I say next?‚Äù  
2. **Practice small‚Äëgroup exposure** ‚Äì start with a trio or a familiar group, gradually increasing size as you get comfortable.  
3. **Use grounding techniques** ‚Äì a quick breath count or a subtle sensory cue (like feeling the chair under you) can bring your nervous system back down when you feel the anxiety spike.  

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to prefer deeper, one‚Äëon‚Äëone connections. You don‚Äôt have to force yourself into every group chat; pick the situations that matter most and give yourself credit for the steps you do take. You‚Äôve got this.","

POST TITLE: DAE experience 'burnout' for several days after one very rough day?

POST BODY: After a day where I'm an absolute mess and have to push through some very tricky anxiety I'll end up feeling burned out for about 2 weeks afterwards. I struggle to eat and I wake up exhausted every morning and feel dizzy and in general have a much higher baseline of anxiety that usual.

Anyone else have this? Could it be something like Adrenal Fatigue?

opsui7,Anxiety,My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions!,chrwiakgjw462q1,"I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

A few things that can help you stay on track:  

1. **Schedule a ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù check‚Äëin** every few months, even if it‚Äôs just a brief phone call or a self‚Äëreview of your logs.

kgkjs8,Anxiety,Does anybody have a high amount of social anxiety but no fear of public speaking or making presentation?,discocrisco,"For me, I have a huge amount of social anxiety but I have zero anxiety with making presentations or public speaking.  

Being in business meeting is easy for me.  Or speaking at AA meeting.  It is almost second nature.

I wonder if anybody else has the same issue and specifically, struggle with one on one communication.  Dating is near impossible for me.",815,112,1608426824,"I used to be in theatre. I‚Äôve literally performed in front of hundreds of people with little to no issue, I would be able to look directly into the audience, I could sing despite being self conscious of my voice...

But going to a social gathering? I want to throw up. Any situation that involves possible one-on-one conversation makes me want to throw up, shake, and I end up either talking about any random thing or I don‚Äôt talk at all. I have to know everything about the situation in order to alleviate the anxiety just a little bit. 

I think the difference is maybe just knowing what to expect and having a general outline of what you need to be talking about. At AA, you talk about AA stuff. At a business meeting, you talk about business stuff. Going on a date... what do you talk about? The food? The weather? What questions will be brought up? What questions should I ask?

A personal chat is far less predictable; you‚Äôre juggling body language, intimacy, and the fear of being judged in real time.

A few things that have helped people in the same spot:

* **Treat one‚Äëon‚Äëone talks like mini‚Äëpresentations.** Give yourself a quick ‚Äúagenda‚Äù (e.g., ‚ÄúAsk about their day, share one story, ask a follow‚Äëup‚Äù). The structure reduces uncertainty.

m9imxi,Anxiety,Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism?,[deleted],"Like, to a crippling level.

If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before.

You‚Äôre definitely not alone; many writers (and creative people in general) experience that ‚Äúfeedback‚Äëfear‚Äù loop, especially if you‚Äôve internalized the idea that criticism equals personal failure.

A few things that have helped me break the cycle:

1. **Re‚Äëframe the feedback** ‚Äì treat it as data, not judgment. A comment like ‚Äúthe pacing feels rushed‚Äù is just a piece of information about the story, not a verdict on you as a person.  
2. **Start small** ‚Äì share a single paragraph with someone you trust, or post it in a low‚Äëstakes forum where anonymity is possible. Knowing the stakes are low makes the sting less intense.  
3. **Give yourself a ‚Äúfeedback buffer.‚Äù** After reading any comment, wait five minutes, then write a brief note about what you actually read (e.g., ‚ÄúThey liked the dialogue, suggested tightening the ending‚Äù). This separates the emotional reaction from the factual content.

POST TITLE: Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism?

POST BODY: Like, to a crippling level. I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than ""nice"" or ""cool"" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao

Usually a lot of men can be quite technical, where they want to pinpoint the reason for anxiety and solve it.

In the end, you could explain anxiety, or any other disorder, by looking at genetical predisposition and environmental factors such as childhood experiences or drug use. But that doesn't help you.

I think what's best to say in these situations is ""you're making me feel worse"". Confront them with how black and white they see the anxiety and hand them a mirror for their own behavior.

gqmycs,Anxiety,Does anyone else have intense fear that they‚Äôll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,hocrm,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill ‚Äújinx‚Äù it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she‚Äôs independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

I was the same way when I was your age, all I can suggest is to push yourself but don't rush it. I didn't get my license until I was 21.

Another good metaphor that I like is imagining yourself on a bridge looking below at 3 different trains on 3 tracks. One train carries carts full of your thoughts, one carries your physical responses to those thoughts , and the last carries your urges to act( e. g escape the situation). The idea is to try stay on the bridge without getting involved with anything on the tracks. Just watch the trains pass and just notice. It really helps to desensitize you.",140,UrbanUnicornz,[deleted],62,[deleted],"I totally get what you mean ‚Äì that ‚Äúriver‚Äù metaphor is a game‚Äëchanger. It‚Äôs amazing how just labeling a thought as ‚Äúthinking‚Äù can create a little gap between you and the panic that tries to hijack you.

You can also pair the observation with a grounding anchor (like feeling your feet on the floor or the texture of a pen) to keep the mind anchored in the present. Keep practicing; the more you ‚Äúsit on the riverbank,‚Äù the less likely the current will sweep you away. Thanks for sharing ‚Äì it‚Äôs a reminder that mindfulness really does work.","

icv4t1,Anxiety,Just went to the dentist for the first time in ten years,SexyAbeLincoln,"And it was fine! No cavities, good x-rays. 

When I got out of college I was broke and didn't have insurance, so I stopped going to the dentist. After a while I finally got a decent job and dental insurance, but my anxiety had become worse and my shame/avoidance behaviors kicked in. The more time that passed, the more shame I felt about not having been to the dentist. So I just didn't go. 

I don't know what changed recently, but the other day I just looked up a place with good reviews and made an appointment before I could think about it too much. I told them it had been a few years so I didn't have any x-rays to send over. Nobody made a big deal about it. The dental hygenist and the dentist were both very kind. Also, apparently these days they let you watch Netflix while your teeth are being cleaned?? Back in my day your only entertainment was the sound of metal scraping against tooth enamel. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. None of my friends know about this because I'm too embarrassed to admit to it, but I'm very proud of myself. And to anyone else struggling with avoidance, *you're not alone.* Please try and prioritize your health and ask for help if you need it. Whatever you're avoiding is unlikely to turn out half as bad as you fear.",855,64,1597867179,"Omg, this is me. But even longer üòÖ Thanks for sharing your success!

I totally get the mix of shame and anxiety; dental fear is one of the most common phobias, and the ‚ÄúI should have gone earlier‚Äù spiral only makes it worse.  

A few things that helped me (and might help you keep the momentum):  

1. **Schedule regular ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù appointments** ‚Äì every 6‚Äë12‚ÄØmonths, even if nothing‚Äôs wrong. Knowing it‚Äôs routine takes the ‚Äúbig‚Äëscary‚Äëevent‚Äù feeling out of it.  
2. **Ask for accommodations** ‚Äì like the Netflix you mentioned, or a stress‚Äë‚Äãrelief bite block, or a quick ‚Äúpause‚Äù if you start to feel panicky. Most offices are happy to work with you.  
3. **Reward yourself** after each visit (a favorite meal, a new game, whatever you enjoy). It turns the experience into something positive rather than a punishment.  

You‚Äôve already proven you can break the cycle; keep leaning on that momentum and remember you‚Äôre definitely not alone. üåü","

o5pzin,Anxiety,I hate it when people push me to take weed for my anxiety,[deleted],"I know there‚Äôs no way to not sound like a prude by saying this. Look, I don‚Äôt care if you use weed. If it helps you, that‚Äôs great. It helps with your anxiety? Great.

I also know people generally mean well when they suggest for me to take weed to treat my anxiety/depression instead of the powerful meds I‚Äôm already taking. I don‚Äôt want to name my exact meds, but one of them is a highly addictive medication that‚Äôs being sold on the street to get high. I‚Äôve even gotten offers to sell my supply, but I never do. These meds save me from myself and without it I am an entirely different person being swallowed by own anxiety.

 I actually *don‚Äôt* want to take these meds, because I already have addictive tendencies (although fortunately I never suffered from narcotic addiction). It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs the meds that work best for me, and I have to exercise *a lot* of self-control and caution to not become dependent on them. My goal is to one day get off them entirely.

So‚Ä¶ weed. Sure, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmore harmless‚Äù than most prescription meds out there with less risk, but weed, just like any other substance ‚Äî like medication, alcohol, food ‚Äî can be abused. The last thing I want is to be dependent on a substance to alleviate my anxiety or my depression. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs fun, because whatever effect a drug can give you will never be permanent. It‚Äôs always yourself who has to pick up after yourself and fix your life. 

I don‚Äôt want to deal with the loss of a high, no matter how I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù. Hell, I don‚Äôt want to *rely* on a high AT ALL. I want to be able to cope and sustain myself independently without any sort of substance to assist me. 

Like I‚Äôve said above, I know people generally mean well. But it starts getting annoying when they keep pushing for me to take weed, like it‚Äôs a panacea for my illnesses. I want to tell them: I‚Äôm glad it helps you, I am, but just because it works for you doesn‚Äôt mean it will work for me. If we exchange routines ‚Äî you take my meds and I take weed ‚Äî I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd say an entirely different story.

EDIT: I want to say thank you to everyone who took time to read and comment, especially those who validated my feelings. It‚Äôs been refreshing and interesting to read how everyone reacts differently to weed.",720,198,1624376283,Weed makes me anxiety worse.

A good way to set the boundary is to be clear and brief: ‚ÄúI appreciate that cannabis works for you, but my current meds are the only thing that keeps my anxiety from taking over. I‚Äôm not looking to add another substance.‚Äù Most friends will respect that once they see you‚Äôre firm.  

If the pressure keeps coming, consider sharing a bit about the risks you‚Äôre already managing (addiction‚Äëprone meds, the temptation to sell them, etc.) ‚Äì it helps people understand why you‚Äôre cautious. Meanwhile, keep exploring non‚Äëpharmacologic tools‚Äîtherapy, mindfulness, regular exercise, or a support group‚Äîso you feel less alone in the ‚Äúno‚Äëweed‚Äù lane.  

You deserve to make the choices that feel safest for you, and it‚Äôs okay to say ‚Äúno‚Äù without guilt. Stay strong.","

b137g2,Anxiety,Does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? Read more inside.,saltyman420,"What‚Äôs up y‚Äôall, hope you are all doing well.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I‚Äôd always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I‚Äôm gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I‚Äôm doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what‚Äôs plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It‚Äôs kinda because it‚Äôs a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I‚Äôm like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks.",814,102,1552584798,"One of my hobbies is I'm a musician... A lot of the time my mind is focused on the fact that I'm not good enough and what other people think of the stuff I make (Especially when I cross reference stuff)... It not only makes me less creative but makes me demoralized and just want to quit all together so I don't work on stuff... as a result I don't improve and that feeds back into the problem. Its not just music either... but my university work too. 

In summary I feel this all the damn time and I hate it so much...",88,-Arrez-,"Honestly, I feel like this just comes with being an adult.

A couple things that have helped me break the cycle:

1. **Schedule ‚Äúworry time.‚Äù** Set a 10‚Äë15‚ÄØminute slot each day to dump all the worries onto paper. When the clock‚Äôs up, give yourself permission to let them go until the next slot.  
2. **Mini‚Äëcuriosity breaks.** Pick a tiny, low‚Äëstakes activity that forces you to imagine‚Äîsketch a random doodle, write a one‚Äësentence ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù story, or explore a new YouTube channel for 5‚ÄØminutes. The brain gets a lot of mileage from short, playful bursts.  
3. **Ground‚Äëing habits.** Simple breathing or a short walk can pull you out of the rumination loop and create mental space for creativity to re‚Äëenter.

Remember, the brain is plastic; the more you practice stepping out of the anxiety loop, the easier it gets to let those old curious vibes","

nmx0ru,Anxiety,I always feel like I'm bothering people,Throwaway0198701,"Every time I think about messaging someone, I always think ""Will they think I'm annoying?"" or ""Do they really even care?""

Every time I get the same feeling that I'm being annoying or bothering them.

I don't know what to do I'm too afraid to message old friends or just people in general.

Then there's the question ""Will they think I don't care about them?"" because of how little I message them and they don't know how hard it is for me to message them.

Am I just being a bitch? I can't bring myself to just message them, even though I want to.

Anyone got advice?",870,46,1622205813,"I struggled with this for a while too, until my therapist gave me a technique that completely relieved these thoughts for me.

Here's what she told me:

First, pick three or four characteristics that you would want people to describe you as. I chose supportive, kind, intelligent, and calm. Take your time and really reflect on what your ideal self would be like. Once you choose your words, think of these as your *objectives.* 

When you are socializing, all that is in your power is being the most \*your characteristics\* as you can. In your case, (I'll use my words for this example), you are afraid of reaching out to people, but if your message is kind, supportive, calm, and intelligent, then what more can you do? If you are being the best you can be, there is no reason to live up to other people's expectations of you. If they are actually bothered by you, then it is their issue, not yours. 

I personally struggled with replaying scenes of socializing with people in my head afterward, so I would use this to sort of grade myself - I would ask, ""was I as supportive as I could have been? How so?"" and then go through all of my characteristics.

I recommend putting little sticky notes around your house, or put a note on your phone to remind you of this. It took a little bit for me to actually accept that this is all that I can do, but now, I never worry about what other people think of me because I am simply trying to be the best version of myself, and if someone doesn't like that, then that is their burden, not mine, and it shouldn't be yours either.

I hope this helps :) and please ask for clarification if I didn't explain clearly enough!",193,hankhan18,"I feel like this to, it‚Äôs not true though. It‚Äôs just our brains playing tricks on us. The people in our lives love us more then we think",11,sasha_Black03,"I get it‚Äîthere‚Äôs that little voice that jumps in every time you hit ‚Äúsend,‚Äù wondering if you‚Äôre being a nuisance. It‚Äôs totally normal to feel self‚Äëconscious, especially if you haven‚Äôt talked to someone in a while trying to be considerate of their time.

A helpful trick is to reframe the situation: most people actually enjoy hearing from a friend, even if it‚Äôs just a quick ‚ÄúHey, thought of you!‚Äù It‚Äôs not a test of how much you care, it‚Äôs simply staying connected. You don‚Äôt need a long, perfectly‚Äëcrafted message; a short, genuine line is enough.

If the anxiety still feels big, try a ‚Äúlow‚Äëstakes‚Äù approach: send a casual meme, a funny article, or a brief ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs life?‚Äù and see how they respond. Their reply will give you a cue that they‚Äôre open to chatting. Remember, friendships are a two‚Äëway street‚Äîyour reaching out shows you value them, and that‚Äôs never ‚Äúbeing a bitch.‚Äù Give yourself credit for taking the first step; the worst that can happen is they‚Äôre busy, which is okay, too.","

bbmwxx,Anxiety,I asked to change the tv at the doctors,PM_SEROTONIN,"I was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how Jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. I thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. Unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. I wanted to change it to CNN but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. So i changed it to local news. So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself.",850,66,1554907846,"Your next step would be to politely ask if they mind watching the news instead. I know that‚Äôs a huge feat when you have anxiety, but you are not a burden, and they may even feel appreciated that you value their opinion. Or another solution could be headphones and streaming something if that‚Äôs available for you. But I suppose that could also be counter productive if you‚Äôre trying to challenge your anxiety by staying connected with your outside world and not staying in a technological bubble. Either way, I AM PROUD OF YOU! :)",148,PoblanoMyOmelette,"I never have watched the 700 club and I rarely partake in watching TV evangelism,  but I will say a few things about this. 

First, I am shocked this post was upvoted so many times. And I truly believe it wasn‚Äôt upvoted because of the victory you had, but because you made a very stressed point about not wanting to hear anything about Jesus. 

It deeply... deeply saddens me, grieves me to see such repulsiveness to the lord on your part. Where you are willing or have the thought of leaving to your car to get away from him. Before you stop reading, and yes I am speaking directly to the original poster, please hear me out. 

What exactly did God do to you to cause you to be so repulsed by him? Don‚Äôt blame it on the hosts. Because I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what this is all about. 

God, Jesus Christ, didn‚Äôt do anything to you to cause you harm. He didn‚Äôt cause any of this world to act the way it does. Mankind, in all his ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù fights tooth and nail against God because he thinks he knows better. And satan and his army of demons, work in the invisible world and heavenly places to seek out and destroy us. It is satan, not God who causes strife. 

If anything, you should be repulsed by CNN or any other news network for that matter, especially modern pop culture. It‚Äôs filled with the work of satan. 

Let me stress this again, God did not do anything to you to cause YOU to hate him. You hate him because you‚Äôve been deceived. 

God has done EVERYTHING he could to save us from our sin. When he said, ‚Äúit is finished,‚Äù on the cross, he meant it. Anyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved, our salvation is sealed in him. 

The fact is, in your current mindset and where your heart is, you are going to hell. Many are on that path. Many! The Bible says so. 

God loves us so much. You have NO IDEA how much he loves us. If you think for a second how hard this worldly life is, imagine how bad hell will be. With no second chances. And eternal separation from Jesus Christ, his love and his glory. 

Yes, I‚Äôm approaching this the classical hated way by so many who disbelieve by bringing hell into the equation. And I am standing my ground in this. Because that‚Äôs the final verdict for all who deny the one and ONLY living God. 

My intention is not to fear you into allowing the lord into your heart. My intention is to show you what‚Äôs on the line. God, is beyond good. He offers love like you‚Äôve never experienced. Your family, husband, kids or no one else can even come close to the love Christ offers. He is a gracious, loving, merciful and forgiving God. He‚Äôs coming back soon. 

I would hate to see you continue to hold on to so much hate for him and be eternally separated in complete agony. Christ said there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth there. Is it really worth leaning on your own understanding for these things? Your own understanding will get you no where. 

I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice all of my karma to stress to you how wrong you are right now. And it‚Äôs out of love. 

Over 700 people upvoted this post and it goes to show just how far separated we are from Christ. It deeply saddens me. We all have our own choices to make. And mine right now is to scream at you as loud as I can and say go the other way. You won‚Äôt be let down. 

What hope is there for any of us to live a part from God? Honestly ask yourself this question. What really matters in your life a part from God? My belief is a part from God, nothing.... absolutely nothing matters in this life.  If God is not the head of our life, we are dust in the wind. 

I pray you come to Christ someday. You won‚Äôt be popular, people will hate you, you won‚Äôt be upvoted, you‚Äôll be down voted because you speak in his name. But that‚Äôs ok. Jesus said the world hated him first and so we‚Äôll be hated as well as a result.

Wake up people! Jesus is coming back soon. Don‚Äôt be deceived! The day of the lord is at hand! And I can‚Äôt wait for it. But in the meantime, I desperately want to see people on Christ‚Äôs side. Not their own  misdirected side. 

Out of love to all! 

Amen brothers and sisters.",-6,Makingchanges33,"I totally get why that felt like a small victory ‚Äì sitting in a waiting room, the volume of the 700 Club blaring, and the pressure to ‚Äúgo along‚Äù can be the last thing you want while you‚Äôre trying to stay calm. It‚Äôs easy to feel judged for picking something else, especially when the room‚Äôs vibe leans toward a particular message.  

If you ever find yourself in that spot again, just remember that the remote is literally in your hands, and you‚Äôre not obligated to stick with whatever‚Äôs on. A quick ‚ÄúCan we switch to something else?‚Äù or simply pressing a button is perfectly fine ‚Äì most people are too wrapped up in their own screens to notice.  

Congrats on taking that little step for yourself; sometimes the tiniest acts of autonomy make the waiting room feel a little less oppressive. Keep doing what feels right for you.","

POST TITLE: I asked to change the tv at the doctors

POST BODY: I was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how Jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. I thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. Unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. I wanted to change it to CNN but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. So i changed it to local news. So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself.

Getting COVID, then switching birth‚Äëcontrol methods, can both mess with your nervous system and hormone balance, so it‚Äôs totally understandable that your worry‚Äëmeter is now on overdrive.  

One thing that often helps is to separate the *thought* from the *action*: notice when a ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù pops up, label it (‚Äújust a worry‚Äù), and then gently shift your attention to something concrete (a short walk, a favorite song, a grounding exercise). Cognitive‚Äëbehavioral tools like the ‚Äúworry‚Äëtime‚Äù technique‚Äîsetting a 10‚Äëminute slot each day to dump all those catastrophizing thoughts‚Äîcan limit how much they intrude on the rest of your day.  

If the birth‚Äëcontrol change feels like a big trigger, a quick chat with your prescriber about alternatives or a short course of a mild anxiolytic might be worth exploring.

I'm on break now and I decided to start seeing a therapist back home who my parents recommended to me.

Anxiety and panic attacks are *real* physiological responses; they‚Äôre not ‚Äújust for attention.‚Äù A good therapist‚Äôs job is to help you understand the underlying fear, not to dismiss it.

It‚Äôs completely reasonable to be upset. If a clinician makes you feel judged, it‚Äôs okay to set a boundary or look for someone else who approaches you with more empathy. You deserve a therapist who validates your experience while teaching coping tools (breathing exercises, grounding, exposure work, etc.).

Seeing a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation is a solid next step, and medication can be a helpful part of a broader treatment plan. In the meantime, try small self‚Äëcare habits‚Äîshort walks, a regular sleep schedule, and journaling what triggers your anxiety.

Being on the front lines of a pandemic, especially when you‚Äôre already dealing with COVID yourself, is a nightmare nobody signed up for.

First, prioritize your own recovery. If you‚Äôre COVID‚Äëpositive, insist on a paid sick‚Äëleave or at least a ‚Äúno‚Äëpay‚Äù day off; most hospitals have policies (or can make accommodations) for staff who are ill. Talk to your union or HR about a temporary reassignment to a low‚Äëcontact role‚Äîmany places have ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äëonly‚Äù teams now.

Second, protect your mental health. Find a therapist who understands healthcare burnout (many offer tele‚Äësessions with sliding scales) and lean on peers who get it. Even short daily breaks, mindfulness apps, or a quick walk can help reset the anxiety loop.

Lastly, remember you‚Äôre not alone. Many clinicians are actively looking for greener work environments or stepping into tele‚Äëhealth, per‚Äëdiem, or travel nursing gigs that offer better staffing ratios and more control over shifts. Exploring those options could give you the breathing room you need.

8vtkqi,Anxiety,"Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?",anetanetanet,"**EDIT:** Wow I didn't think I'd get this many comments. I'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! 

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. 

I especially have this with groups of teenagers, I'm genuinely afraid of them lol

If I'm in a group I might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.

What's your experience been with this? Did you eventually get over it? ",799,114,1530635249,I get this sometimes and I'm in my 30s. I don't think it's an age thing. I think it's related to social anxiety and that intense feeling of being judged by everyone....being hyperaware in social settings.,138,[deleted],"Lol why do you care about teenagers? They are still experiencing life and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. 

At my undergrad, people would laugh at me bc they knew I was a lesbian. No joke, it was so stupid. I knew this bc some people would whisper and think I couldn‚Äôt hear them. I didn‚Äôt give a shit bc it meant they‚Äôre just immature and not yet fit for a society of diverse people. ",-3,RobynHood-,"I hear you ‚Äì that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre probably laughing at me‚Äù alarm can feel like an old echo from school, especially when you‚Äôre alone and it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs actually happening. It‚Äôs totally normal for a brain that‚Äôs been bullied for years to default to a threat‚Äëresponse, even when there‚Äôs no real threat.  

A couple things that have helped me (and many others) are:  

1. **Reality‚Äëcheck pause** ‚Äì When you hear laughter, give yourself a few seconds to notice the context. Are people looking at you? Are they sharing a joke? Most of the time it‚Äôs just background noise, not a spotlight on you.  

2. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì Focus on something concrete (the texture of your shirt, the rhythm of your breathing). That pulls you out of the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù loop.  

3. **Gradual exposure** ‚Äì Spend short, low‚Äëstakes moments in groups you feel comfortable with and practice observing without jumping to conclusions. Over time the brain rewires the automatic assumption.  

You‚Äôre not alone in this, and you‚Äôve already taken a huge step by talking about it. Keep being kind to yourself, and remember that the laughter you hear most often","

ed5jr6,Anxiety,I got a 4.0 this semester in college!,vaguefully," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.",877,35,1576818988,"I also suffer from depression and anxiety, along with PTSD.

A few things that have helped me (and many others) break that cycle:

1. **Wind‚Äëdown routine** ‚Äì Put a predictable, low‚Äëstimulus routine in place 30‚Äë60‚ÄØminutes before bed (dim lights, gentle stretch or breathing, a short journal). It signals to your brain that it‚Äôs safe to shift into sleep mode.

2. **Scheduled worry time** ‚Äì Set aside 10‚Äë15‚ÄØminutes earlier in the evening to write down the worries that pop up. Once they‚Äôre on paper, you can ‚Äúfile‚Äù them and tell yourself you‚Äôll revisit them tomorrow.

3. **Grounding techniques** ‚Äì The 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath, body‚Äëscan meditations, or the ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù sensory exercise can pull you out of the mental spiral right when it starts.

If the anxiety feels overwhelming or persists, consider talking to a therapist; CBT‚Äëbased strategies are especially effective for bedtime rumination.

jn9o4i,Anxiety,"Terrorist attack happened in my city yesterday, I feel like I'm going to break down",OrdinaryCow7,"Yesterday evening my city was hit by a terrible terrorist attack. Five people have been confirmed dead. The attack happened in an area where I spend all of my free evenings. I don't remember the last time I met up with a friend and did not go there. 

The first time I read the news, I thought maybe it's just some people who got into a fight and one of them shot the other. It doesn't happen often but it happens sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

Then a family member, who was not at home at the time, sent me news reports and videos of the attack. I feared for their life until I finally heard the door bell ring. I turned on the news and on national tv was confronted with uncensored videos of people being shot. I heard the fear in the journalists voice as she was walking to a safe spot. I saw the people running around, trying to reach any place where they would be safe. All of that happened in the heart of our city, where I had just gone for a walk a day prior. 

I am so deeply distraught and I don't know what to do. I would call my therapist but I wouldn't know what to tell her. I just wanna curl up and cry. The whole day long I've been pacing around my apartment unable to calm down. I feel like my heart is shaking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety almost half a year ago and I don't remember it ever being this bad.

The days prior to the attack I spent studying for an exam I have tomorrow. I was super proud of my progress. Today I do not feel like studying at all. I don't know how the hell I am supposed to focus and think for one hour straight during my exam. I fear that I am going to fail it now too. Everything is snowballing. A family member told me to stay at home but as soon as I think of that as an option, I feel like I'm faking it and trying to avoid my exam. This causes me to feel guilty which makes everything even worse.

I woke up every hour last night, and everytime my anxiety got worse and worse. In my head I saw the attackers shooting at my window, I saw them shooting at us while we were in the tram, the metro, the mall, even my university. I didn't feel safe.  Now that feeling of unsafety has passed, but only because I didn't have to leave my house at all today. I wonder how I'll feel when I have to go outside.

Like, I'll stay for 30 minutes and if I'm not having a good time, I'll leave. Quite a few times I've done this, and when the 30 minutes are up most of my anxiety has subsided and I'll end up staying and having fun. Just getting out the door if often the hardest part for me. 

If you do decide to stay home, stick to it! Find something fun to do solo so you don't end up wondering what's happening at the party and thinking about what you're missing out on.

Good luck! As someone with social anxiety, I can totally relate to this.",203,strangeXpowers,"Oh I know this feel very well. It just shows you how stupid those false alarms of anxiety are. It's a useless feeling that just scares you without reason and causes you pain regardless of what you do.

Try not to let anxiety take over and stop you from doing something you want to do. The more you let it bar you from events and parties, the harder it will be to break out of that thought pattern. Next time try pushing yourself a bit more, and eventually you will be able to go and have fun without being freaked out. Good luck!",3,Pandasticus,"I hear you ‚Äì that knot‚Äëin‚Äëyour‚Äëstomach feeling can feel like a wall you can‚Äôt climb, and then the ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù spiral starts after you step back. It‚Äôs normal to feel both relief (you avoided a panic‚Äëinducing situation) and regret (you think you missed out). The trick isn‚Äôt to force yourself to be ‚Äúsocial‚Äù all the time, but to give yourself permission to take small, manageable steps.

Try a ‚Äújust show up for 10‚Äë15 minutes‚Äù rule next time, even if you leave early. The pressure is lower, and you‚Äôll often find the anxiety eases once you‚Äôre there. Also, write down one thing you enjoyed about the night (maybe a funny text, a song playing, or just the fact you rested) ‚Äì it helps reframe the experience instead of viewing it as a total loss.

If the pattern keeps repeating, consider a brief chat with a counselor or therapist; they can give you tools to break the cycle without feeling like you‚Äôre ‚Äúforcing‚Äù yourself. You‚Äôre not alone, and every tiny step counts. Hang in there!","

f8xi8b,Anxiety,Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.,CaptainPasty,"I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

POST TITLE: Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.

POST BODY: I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

EDIT: Thanks for the award stranger. I'm glad it cheered someone else up too!

gozgvh,Anxiety,I am so proud of my wife,underwaterdude1,"My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn‚Äôt pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn‚Äôt want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said ‚Äú I know you need me tonight but I don‚Äôt know if I am strong enough.‚Äù She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. ‚ÄúBut I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.‚Äù 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn‚Äôt have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come.",879,29,1590211622,"This makes me super happy.

Although I‚Äôm not married I‚Äôve been with my partner for 5 years now and go through pretty much what you mentioned.

Feel free to send a PM or chat request if you wanna tLk.",15,cryingmetsfan,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs exhausting trying to support someone with severe anxiety while also feeling like your own needs get lost in the mix.‚ÄØYou did a huge amount of emotional work tonight just by being honest about how you were feeling, and it‚Äôs amazing that she was able to push through her own panic‚Äëlike response to be there for you.‚ÄØThat ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù moment shows how far you both have come, and it‚Äôs a real testament to the trust you‚Äôve built.

A couple of things that might help keep the momentum going:  
1. **Create a simple ‚Äúcheck‚Äëin‚Äù signal** (a word, a hand‚Äëgesture, or a short text) that lets her know you need extra support without triggering a full‚Äëblown discussion.  
2. **Schedule regular low‚Äëstakes ‚Äúre‚Äëcharge‚Äù times** where you both share what‚Äôs been tough that day, so the heavy conversations don‚Äôt all pile up on one night.  
3. **Encourage her to keep using coping tools** (breathing, grounding, therapist‚Äëguided strategies) even when she‚Äôs feeling strong enough to help you ‚Äì it reinforces her own resilience.

1. Receive text/email. Feel some anxiety over what to say back so I put it off.
2. Put it off long enough that I feel that too much time has passed for me to answer without it being weird.
3. Experience mounting anxiety and my mental block grows as days go by without me answering.
4. Convince myself that the person who sent me the text/email in the first place now hates me and thinks of me as lazy/irresponsible/uncaring.

9g1bwv,Anxiety,Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,FleshEatinThugRpllnt,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.

But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down.

A few things that might help:

My anxiety feels like a train about to run me over, complete with intense, obsessional, and paranoid thinking about how I may or may not have messed up at work/how someone probably doesn‚Äôt like me/how I‚Äôm an awful person and ruined something, etc. Yet you want me to ‚Äúlisten to my breaths,‚Äù be mindful of my body and think about seagulls on a beach. Is there anything else you‚Äôd like me to do? Sprout wings and fly?",771,130,1636627164,"I think some people have touched on this already. To give it some emphasis - the time to practice mindfulness/breathing is *not* when you're in crisis. And by ""practice"", I mean building up those skills so that you learn how to use them effectively.

If someone handed you a musical instrument you don't play and told you to walk out onto a stage with an audience and an orchestra waiting and perform a random concerto, you wouldn't be able to do that, either. However, by taking small steps in a safe place, you can learn enough to build up your skills and your confidence to use those skills in an intense situation.

Genuinely, one of the things that can help an anxiety attack is using mindfulness to embrace the feeling instead of resisting it. But to get to the point where that helps instead of hurts? It takes SO. MUCH. WORK. If you can do that work, it can help enormously. Most likely, it will not be easy, nor will you see results quickly. For me, in combination with other tools, it has made a huge difference in reducing the frequency and intensity of panic episodes.",228,asliceofpi,"There is actually this funny but accurate video that was going around YouTube, check it out, it is called ""what if we talked about physical health the way we talk about mental health"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWA0es85hMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWA0es85hMs) 

It is just the not so helpful and really rude things people say to those of us experiencing mental health issues. Your post just made me thing of that. 

Sometimes advice comes from a good place, but people need to realize that they are not being helpful and sometimes making things worse.

I hope you find something that works for you and find some relief!",12,justgettingby2021,"I get it‚Äîbeing told to ‚Äújust breathe‚Äù can feel like the world‚Äôs ‚Äúquick‚Äëfix‚Äù button when the anxiety is a freight train rattling through your thoughts. It‚Äôs not that deep‚Äëbreathing is useless; it‚Äôs that it rarely stops the cascade of ‚Äúwhat‚Äëifs‚Äù and self‚Äëcriticism on its own.

Try pairing a grounding technique with an action that actually *disrupts* the loop. For example, the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 method (name five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, one you taste) pulls your brain out of the spiral and into the present moment. Another option is a brief ‚Äúbody‚Äëreset‚Äù: stand, stretch, or do a set of push‚Äëups‚Äîphysical movement sends fresh sensory input to your nervous system and can blunt the mental chatter.

If you have the space, jotting down the specific worries (e.g., ‚ÄúI think I messed up the report‚Äù) and then writing a realistic counter‚Äëstatement helps you see the gap between fear and fact, a core CBT skill","

Partly because I totaled my car and can‚Äôt really go anywhere currently/not much to do in my town that‚Äôs walkable and partly because I use social media a lot to find things I need.  Like currently:

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that‚Äôs how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don‚Äôt want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it‚Äôs not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it‚Äôs ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON‚ÄôT indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don‚Äôt talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I‚Äôm just in a super weird head space right now and I don‚Äôt feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can‚Äôt even tell if it‚Äôs all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn‚Äôt even exist still. Simpler times. I don‚Äôt know what I need but all I know is I feel like I‚Äôm annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it‚Äôs all just stupid anxiety.

1. **Set tiny ‚Äúphone windows.‚Äù** Pick two specific times (e.g., 9‚ÄØam‚Äì9:15‚ÄØam and 7‚ÄØpm‚Äì7:30‚ÄØpm) to do all the searching, posting, and scrolling. Outside those windows, keep the phone on *Do Not Disturb* or even in another room. The limited windows make the tasks feel doable and give your mind a break.

2. **Use a task‚Äëlist app (or even a paper list).** Write down the concrete things you need to do ‚Äì ‚Äúsearch roommate groups on FB,‚Äù ‚Äúcompare cars on Craigslist,‚Äù ‚Äúcheck IG for ticket codes.‚Äù When a notification pops up, ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this on my list","

POST TITLE: Does anyone else feel straight addicted to their phone, even though you feel as though it just intensifies anxiety?

POST BODY: I know people who literally leave their phones just off for hours or never check them and I‚Äôm over here like obsessively checking shit every five seconds. Partly because I totaled my car and can‚Äôt really go anywhere currently/not much to do in my town that‚Äôs walkable and partly because I use social media a lot to find things I need.  Like currently:

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that‚Äôs how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don‚Äôt want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it‚Äôs not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it‚Äôs ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON‚ÄôT indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don‚Äôt talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I‚Äôm just in a super weird head space right now and I don‚Äôt feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can‚Äôt even tell if it‚Äôs all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn‚Äôt even exist still. Simpler times. I don‚Äôt know what I need but all I know is I feel like I‚Äôm annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it‚Äôs all just stupid anxiety.

I‚Äôm so over it. So much.

A few things that have helped me:

1. **Desensitize** ‚Äì Set a timer for 30‚ÄØseconds and answer a ‚Äúpractice‚Äù call (even if it‚Äôs just you calling your own number). The more you expose yourself, the less the brain treats it as a threat.

fllu8x,Anxiety,Are some people on Reddit just...mean?,ette212,"I just started being more active on Reddit recently. I posted about something in another sub and have been stupidly watching the up / down votes and wondering why the heck someone would down vote a comment of mine that doesn't need to be down voted. From that perspective, Reddit is definitely the wrong place to be for my anxiety... I know it's not rational but I'm just wondering if this is commonly known.

*Edit:* I did not expect this post to grow as much as it did! Overall - thank you to everyone for your support. I am okay, and I would say my post was moreso an observation and also recognizing that my staring at karma isn't healthy. I'm not taking it *too* seriously but I guess it always boggles my mind when people are assholes. In general. Even though I know it's reality.

Remember that up‚Äë and down‚Äëvotes are more about the *post* than the *person* behind it, and sometimes they‚Äôre driven by timing, phrasing, or simply the mood of the subreddit that day.  

A few things that usually help:

1. **Take a step back** ‚Äì give yourself a set amount of time (say 15‚Äë30‚ÄØminutes) before checking the score again.  
2. **Focus on the conversation** ‚Äì if people are replying constructively, that‚Äôs the real feedback, not the vote count.  
3. **Don‚Äôt personalize** ‚Äì a down‚Äëvote isn‚Äôt a judgment of your worth; it‚Äôs just an anonymous signal.  

Most users are looking for good content or a friendly chat, and the kind‚Äëhearted ones will notice you. Keep posting what matters to you, and the karma will settle itself. You‚Äôve already taken a big step by recognizing the anxiety‚Äîgive yourself credit for that. üåü","

l7ey95,Anxiety,can we please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people‚Äôs problem? your problems are valid.,peacelovepositivity_,"i‚Äôve had friends that minimize or compare my problems. i‚Äôve had teachers &amp; therapists &amp; social workers do it too. but either way... it needs to stop. 

i‚Äôll use my old friend as an example. we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúA.‚Äù If i told A that i had a good day or did well on a test, she would roll her eyes &amp; say ‚Äúof course *you* did.‚Äù she always got mad whenever i had something positive happen in my life. even if it was as simple as getting something in the mail. 

she did have anxiety &amp; depression, so i‚Äôm totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i‚Äôve been envious of others before &amp; i‚Äôve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia &amp; depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn‚Äôt leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i‚Äôm not a very open person &amp; prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with ‚Äúoh well you should live a day in my life‚Äù or ‚Äúoh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.‚Äù i‚Äôm obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered &amp; she would respond with ‚Äúya well my family has been murdered twenty times.‚Äù 

it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people‚Äôs problems. that contributes to why i don‚Äôt open up. i‚Äôm always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven‚Äôt showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can‚Äôt bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don‚Äôt want to have a future &amp; i don‚Äôt feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren‚Äôt working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don‚Äôt believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can‚Äôt look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren‚Äôt valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don‚Äôt compare other people‚Äôs problems to theirs. don‚Äôt minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. üåªüñ§üåº",828,64,1611882946,"I hear you ... one comment that's imprinted into my brain comes to mind.

One thing that‚Äôs helped me (and many others) is setting a simple boundary: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for support, not comparison.‚Äù You can say it early in the conversation (‚ÄúI‚Äôm sharing this because I need a listening ear, not advice or a ‚Äòmy‚Äëstory‚Äëis‚Äëbigger‚Äô reply‚Äù).

Also, consider building a small circle of people who *do* practice active listening‚Äîmaybe a therapist who truly validates, a peer‚Äësupport group, or an online community where the rule is ‚Äúno comparison, just compassion.‚Äù

i‚Äôll use my old friend as an example. we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúA.‚Äù If i told A that i had a good day or did well on a test, she would roll her eyes &amp; say ‚Äúof course *you* did.‚Äù she always got mad whenever i had something positive happen in my life. even if it was as simple as getting something in the mail. 

she did have anxiety &amp; depression, so i‚Äôm totally aware of what could cause he to act that way. i‚Äôve been envious of others before &amp; i‚Äôve been depressed about how well other people are doing compared to myself. but it didn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. 

when i got my first job, i was over the moon. my family was so happy. i have *crippling* anxiety/paranoia &amp; depression. so it was a *huge* leap for me. i didn‚Äôt leave my house unless it was to go to school. i was super excited to tell my friend. she got mad at me. that hurt a little bit. 

not to mention when i would tell her about my problems. i‚Äôm not a very open person &amp; prefer to deal with my problems by letting them bottle up. i know, very healthy. anyway, on the few occasions that i opened up i was met with ‚Äúoh well you should live a day in my life‚Äù or ‚Äúoh you had three panic attacks? i has twenty five.‚Äù i‚Äôm obviously exaggerating but you get the point. i could tell A that my family was murdered &amp; she would respond with ‚Äúya well my family has been murdered twenty times.‚Äù 

it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have anxiety or not. it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have mild anxiety or severe anxiety. your struggles are valid. anxiety is anxiety. it sucks. whether you deal with anxiety 24/7 or a couple times a year... your struggles are valid.

just please stop minimizing &amp; comparing people‚Äôs problems. that contributes to why i don‚Äôt open up. i‚Äôm always scared that when i tell people i wanna kill myself &amp; i hate myself &amp; i haven‚Äôt showered in a week &amp; i hate life &amp; i can‚Äôt bond with people &amp; i feel numb &amp; i don‚Äôt want to have a future &amp; i don‚Äôt feel as though i was created for this world &amp; i wanna dropout again &amp; i am desperately absolutely 10000% terrified of people (especially men) &amp; my paranoia is keeping me from functioning &amp; i worry about the future of the world &amp; my meds aren‚Äôt working much anymore &amp; i wanna be alone &amp; i don‚Äôt believe in love &amp; i never want any friends &amp; i have an addiction to eating to cope &amp; i can‚Äôt look in mirrors &amp; blah blah blah- i‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll tell me to grow up. that my problems aren‚Äôt valid. that people have it much worse... which they do. 

anyway. please comfort people when they open up. you never know how hard it is for them. don‚Äôt compare other people‚Äôs problems to theirs. don‚Äôt minimizing their problems. pain is real. pain is valid. no matter how small. sending love &amp; positivity to you all. üåªüñ§üåº

8y1r2y,Anxiety,Does anyone else prefer single player games Over online multiplayer games?,jimiisalive30,"Single player games seem peaceful and relaxing, like everything is going well and you're actually fun.

Multiplayer can be a blast, but the stakes (ranked ladders, toxic chat, unpredictable teammates) can quickly turn a hobby into stress.

If you enjoy the calm, own it.‚ÄØPlay what makes you feel good, whether that‚Äôs wandering through *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* or solving puzzles in *Outer Wilds*. You don‚Äôt have to justify your preferences to anyone‚Äîgaming is a personal escape, not a competition.

If friends tease you, maybe suggest a co‚Äëop session in a low‚Äëpressure game (like *Stardew Valley* or *It Takes Two*) so they see the fun side without the intensity. Or simply set boundaries: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to game together, but I mostly play solo for downtime.‚Äù Your mental well‚Äëbeing matters more than fitting into anyone else‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúreal‚Äù gaming. Keep enjoying what you love!","

O.o,82,Eye_For_An_Ego,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs exhausting to feel everyone‚Äôs vibe like a live‚Äëfeed and then have the signal constantly flicker. Being the ‚Äúemotional barometer‚Äù can make a house feel more like a pressure cooker than a sanctuary.

First, give yourself permission to step out of the emotional loop. When the tension spikes, try a quick ‚Äúreset‚Äù ritual: put on headphones, go to a different room, or even a short walk outside. It‚Äôs okay to protect your own mood instead of trying to balance the whole squad.

Second, set a low‚Äëkey boundary with your friends. Let them know you need some neutral space where you aren‚Äôt expected to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the atmosphere. A simple, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to chill in my room for a bit‚Äù can be enough.

Finally, consider carving out a personal sanctuary outside the house‚Äî a coffee shop, library, or park‚Äîso you still have a place that feels safe and happy. You don‚Äôt have to shoulder everyone‚Äôs emotions; you deserve a space where you can just be. Hang in there, you‚Äôre not alone in this.","

Try building a tiny morning ritual that isn‚Äôt tied to ‚Äúgetting stuff done.‚Äù Even five minutes of gentle stretching, a short breathing exercise (4‚Äë7‚Äë8 or box breathing works well), or writing down three things you‚Äôre grateful for can shift the brain out of alarm mode.

Do you enjoy your job? I was suffering the same way last year in my job of five years, and it got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt sit through a 30 minute meeting without excusing myself to the bathroom to stave off a panic attack. There‚Äôs honestly nothing worse than feeling like every day is a battle against yourself. I finally took a few weeks annual leave and ended up taking off 3 months unpaid. I know not everyone has the luxury of being able to do so, and I was very lucky to be able to do this, but even a short break may help you reset a little bit. The time off helped me realise that work was behind a lot of my anxiety and I‚Äôm now transitioning into a new career path and feeling amazing about it. Of course I couldn‚Äôt have done all this without therapy. If it‚Äôs possible for you I definitely recommend taking some kind of break to rest, even a short one, and getting into therapy (if you‚Äôre not already).

First, try giving yourself a tiny ‚Äúoff‚Äëswitch‚Äù each day, even if it‚Äôs just 5‚ÄØminutes: step outside, do a grounding exercise (e.g., 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breathing, naming five things you see, four you hear, etc.), or splash cold water on your face. Small resets can interrupt the constant alarm.

Second, consider talking to a mental‚Äëhealth professional about medication or CBT; many people with high‚Äëfunctioning anxiety find therapy a game‚Äëchanger, especially when it‚Äôs paired with coping tools for work stress.

Finally, explore whether any aspects of the job could be adjusted‚Äîdifferent tasks, a flexible schedule, or even a gradual transition to a new role. You deserve a work environment that doesn‚Äôt feel like a daily death sentence. Hang in there, and remember you‚Äôre not alone‚Äîthere are people who care and want to help you get through this.","

Yes,6,trippyearthling,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs so frustrating when a ‚Äúlazy‚Äù day suddenly turns into a cascade of aches, migraines, and anxiety. Your body is probably reacting to a combination of dehydration, lack of movement, and the mental switch from ‚Äúbusy‚Äù to ‚Äústill.‚Äù Even a glass of water can tip the balance, and staying still for hours can make tension headaches and chest tightness flare up.

A few low‚Äëeffort tricks that have helped me on similar days:

1. **Sip water regularly** ‚Äì aim for a glass every hour; dehydration is a common migraine trigger.  
2. **Gentle stretch or a short walk** ‚Äì even 5‚ÄØminutes of moving your limbs can release muscle tension and reset your nervous system.  
3. **Grounding breathing** ‚Äì try 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breathing (inhale 4‚ÄØsec, hold 7, exhale 8) a few times when anxiety spikes.  
4. **Light exposure** ‚Äì open curtains or step outside for a few minutes; natural light can improve mood and reduce headache intensity.  

If these symptoms keep showing up, it‚Äôs worth checking in with","

3. **Build a support network** ‚Äì reach out to student wellness centers, join clubs, or find a study buddy; having people who understand your situation makes a huge difference.

Im still not completely sure i wanna take the prozac but dr said it was temporary and that it wasnt addicting at all like i wont have a hard time getting off, its only 20 mg but im just taking it to see how i feel",58,madisonmontgomery1,"I hear you ‚Äì it‚Äôs unsettling to feel that light‚Äëheaded spin even when you‚Äôre not ‚Äúon edge.‚Äù‚ÄØSometimes the body‚Äôs vestibular system can stay a bit hypersensitive after a long stretch of anxiety, or simple things like low blood pressure, dehydration, or even a subtle inner‚Äëear issue can cause that constant, mild wooziness.

A few low‚Äërisk things you could try first:

* **Hydration & electrolytes** ‚Äì aim for 2‚Äì3‚ÄØL of water a day and consider a pinch of salt or an electrolyte drink if you‚Äôre active.  
* **Posture & movement** ‚Äì gentle neck/shoulder rolls and the ‚Äúbrand‚Äënew‚Äëperson‚Äù exercise (slowly sit, stand, walk) can reset the balance sensors.

POST TITLE: Does anyone ever feel like they are in a constant state of mild dizziness

POST BODY: I can feel dizzy when walking around my house without feeling anxious. I have had anxiety and dizziness at the same time but when I‚Äôm dizzy and not anxious it scares me. I have thought maybe I‚Äôm anxious without knowing and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm dizzy. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I have had high anxiety for almost a year and this is the after effects. I don‚Äôt really have health issues and my doctor doesn‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs necessary to do an mri on my brain because it‚Äôs very unlikely I have an issue in my brain.

My friend later messaged me saying she didn't see me at lunch and thought was I wasn't in the office, but no, I just sat slightly out of view. They just didn't see me.

It sounds like the officers picked up on how badly you were struggling in the moment and tried to make sure you were safe, which, while maybe a bit intimidating, was actually a good sign that they cared about your wellbeing.

A few things that might help next time:  
1. **Carry a brief note** (or a card on your phone) that explains your anxiety, medication, and any emergency contacts. Handing it over right away can give the officer context before the panic sets in.  
2. **Practice a grounding technique** (e.g., the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 sensory exercise) that you can do while sitting in the car, so you have something to focus on when the anxiety spikes.  
3. **Let your therapist know about this encounter**‚Äîthey can help you develop a plan for similar situations and reinforce coping tools.

You‚Äôre already doing the hard work of getting help, and it‚Äôs okay to feel shaken after an episode like this. Keep leaning on your support network, and remember that asking for help (even from a police‚Äëinvolved crisis team) is a sign of strength, not weakness.","

mwjaet,Anxiety,anxiety wastes SOO much time,throwawaysnowski,"I've always been and anxious person, but this past year my anxiety and depression got so much worse.

And now almost a year later, its still there, intrusive thoughts, always overthinking. Honestly for the last year, i don't think there was a single time I was truly at peace, just sitting on the couch and relaxing. Its literally either me being anxious/depressed or me doing my best to distract myself from my thoughts.

And i've just realized how much time i've wasted. I look back this past year. and i dont think about memories i've made, fun i've had, or accomplishments, its just my anxiety taking up all my mental space. And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted. And even now, as i realize how much i've lost from this, I still can't stop my brain from being so worked up. Its so anoying",846,38,1619138786,"I feel this so deeply.

But there‚Äôs also lots and lots of great memories. I really appreciate my anxiety free days, even more then before!

Maybe time for you to change what you are doing. New meds maybe? Therapy, or a different kind of therapy or therapist if you‚Äôre already doing it. Learn some new coping skills. It‚Äôs not easy, but I think sometimes we just need shaken up a bit to get out of the funk!

And now almost a year later, its still there, intrusive thoughts, always overthinking. Honestly for the last year, i don't think there was a single time I was truly at peace, just sitting on the couch and relaxing. Its literally either me being anxious/depressed or me doing my best to distract myself from my thoughts.

And i've just realized how much time i've wasted. I look back this past year. and i dont think about memories i've made, fun i've had, or accomplishments, its just my anxiety taking up all my mental space. And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted. And even now, as i realize how much i've lost from this, I still can't stop my brain from being so worked up. Its so anoying

I guess I should say thanks?,131,shadowblujay,"How do you get out of the thought loop? I think that is similar to what I am going through, but let me explain. I have anxiety and mild depression as well, I get to where it feels like days turn into months. I feel like I can't get outside of my own head sometimes. I often wondered if there is even a way to do that honestly. Like right now, I love going to my Dr. I know that sounds weird, but I feel safe and comfortable there. That is Friday, but to me it seems literally like Friday will never get here. It is just Tuesday and to me, the next 2 days are going to literally drag by no matter what I do to move them quicker. It just feels like days are turning into months and I am thinking this is something to do with my mild depression. 

I am starting work here soon, thinking that might calm some of it down. I was just wondering what you did to get out of the thought loop, because that feels like what I am going through. Keep up the good work and stay sober. Seven years in July free from opiates. Best decision I ever made in my life well other than leaving my ex husband.

If you ever hit a rough patch, remember that cravings are just neuro‚Äëchemical signals‚Äînot a moral failing. Lean on your support network, keep a ‚Äúthought‚Äëlog‚Äù to spot patterns, and consider a low‚Äëkey community (AA, SMART Recovery, or an online forum) for accountability.

gpr8c6,Anxiety,Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day,FallUpJV,"For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.

You might already know that anxiety is caused by our fight/flight reflex, aka how our body protects itself from a threat. The main point is that its purely an animalistic response left over from when we were apes - upon seeing a bear, our bodies give us a hit of adrenaline which causes higher heart rate, breathing fast, shaking, to gives us more strength to run away or fight.

You absentmindedly forget this, and reach to take a bite (laugh). You're not being malicious, but its a social mistake, and the wolf who killed it growls at you to get back. As a result, you are temporarily isolated from the group because they are angry at you, and you go hungry. So being isolated = bad for survival.

If you haven‚Äôt already, try keeping a tiny ‚Äúwin‚Äù journal (evening notes of what went well, even if it‚Äôs just a good meal or a calm moment). It can reinforce those quieter days and give you a concrete reminder when anxiety spikes. Also, gentle grounding or breathing drills‚Äîlike the 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 technique‚Äîcan be handy ‚Äúquick‚Äëfix‚Äù tools when you sense the early rumble of a panic wave.

hf4z51,Anxiety,"DAE get ""emotional build-up"" over time because of anxiety and the only solution is to cry it out?",[deleted],"I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for 19 years now. Sometimes, it gets better, but then I'll start building up anxiety, internalizing it, and then have an emotional breakdown for months-worth of anxiety. Crying seems to be the only thing that relieves the pressure.

I know that's the concept of catharsis, and others must experience it, too. I also know that PTSD can develop due to the accumulation of stressful life experiences (as opposed to a singular traumatic event), so the same underlying concepts can probably apply here, too. 

But fuck, all I want to do is cry my eyes out without having to explain why I'm crying. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm super anxious atm.

‚Äê----------------------------------

EDIT: I'm really glad we all kind of took the opportunity to bond over something so stressful. It makes me happy that the anxiousness I felt yesterday opened the floor for us to talk candidly about what we experience. I hope everyone feels like they're not alone. I hope we all get to feeling better, or at least discovering new, healthy ways of coping with things. ‚ù§",795,86,1593018826,i do that too. i may not even notice the emotional build-up until i cry my eyes out. but its always refreshing.,73,darkywitch,,0,,"I hear you ‚Äì carrying anxiety around for almost two decades can feel like a pressure cooker that finally needs to vent. Crying isn‚Äôt ‚Äúweak‚Äù; it‚Äôs your body‚Äôs way of releasing built‚Äëup tension when other outlets haven‚Äôt caught up.  

If you want a bit more control over the ‚Äúbreakdowns,‚Äù try giving yourself a regular, safe space to process: a short journaling session, a 5‚Äëminute grounding exercise, or even a scheduled ‚Äúcry‚Äëtime‚Äù in the shower or on a couch. Those little releases can keep the flood from becoming months‚Äëlong.  

Therapy (especially CBT or EMDR) can help you spot the patterns of internalizing anxiety before they stack up, and a therapist can teach you tools for emotional regulation that feel less overwhelming.  

In the meantime, be gentle with yourself‚Äîallow the tears, and remember you‚Äôre not alone in needing that release. ‚ù§Ô∏è","

I didn‚Äôt even know what to write down in the answer book, so it turned in to a long written explanation of why I hadn‚Äôt been to class and what was happening. I never saw the professor again after that final was turned in and I took a few years off of school to get myself together.

Haha, despite all the negativity on the internet, most folks are willing to extend a helping hand or show high levels of empathy when they see someone is truly struggling.

BTW, if you're in college/univeristy try to get formal accommodations. It's just a good way to track all of it, because not all professors will react with the same level of kindness. Also when it comes to job searching you have a paper trail to explain any sort of bad grades or whatever! Good luck!

Keep those lines of communication open: a quick email or a brief check‚Äëin after class can remind them you‚Äôre still engaged and let them tweak accommodations if needed.‚ÄØIf you haven‚Äôt already, consider registering with your school‚Äôs disability services; they can formalize any needed adjustments (extra time, alternative assessments, etc.) and take some of the burden off you.  

Also, keep building your own coping toolbox‚Äîshort grounding exercises, a breathing app, or a quick walk can calm a spike before it spirals. You‚Äôve already proven you can advocate for yourself, and that skill will serve you well in any class. Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôre doing great!","

For me, the anxiety started around age‚ÄØ6, but it stayed in the background until puberty amplified it.

One thing that helped me (and many therapists recommend) is ‚Äúre‚Äëparenting‚Äù those younger parts of yourself.

ci7u59,Anxiety,Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?,TryLink,"I'm a bit of a history buff, and I made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently. Naturally they discussed things like the Holocaust, the Red Terror, and other atrocities of that era.  That shit really gets to me, and lately I've found myself being overly sensitive to every terrible thing on the news as a result.  A college girl goes missing, a boy is murdered by his step-dad, etc; you get the drift.  It can be a little over whelming sometimes.

POST TITLE: Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?

POST BODY: I'm a bit of a history buff, and I made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently. Naturally they discussed things like the Holocaust, the Red Terror, and other atrocities of that era.  That shit really gets to me, and lately I've found myself being overly sensitive to every terrible thing on the news as a result.  A college girl goes missing, a boy is murdered by his step-dad, etc; you get the drift.  It can be a little over whelming sometimes.  I just don't understand how human beings are capable of doing such horrible things to one another.

hlxgxb,Anxiety,Anybody else feel dread when company is coming over?,throwmeinthetrash147,"UPDATE: everything was literally fine and I overreacted 

My friends are coming by tomorrow for a short visit. They‚Äôll probably only be here for 3 hours max. I‚Äôm so unnecessarily anxious about it. They are a nice couple and I‚Äôve been friends with them for many years. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for me to feel this way, yet every time I think about having company over I feel  sick to my stomach and shaky. I‚Äôm now worried if my house is clean enough even though I‚Äôve been scrubbing stuff down all day long.

A few things that usually help:  

1. **Set a realistic standard** ‚Äì you‚Äôve already scrubbed all day, so give yourself credit. A tidy, lived‚Äëin home is more than enough for friends who care about you, not your cleaning skills.  
2. **Create a low‚Äëstress plan** ‚Äì pick one quick activity (a short walk, a simple snack, a favorite playlist) that you can turn on when you start feeling shaky.  
3. **Talk it out** ‚Äì let your friends know you‚Äôre a bit nervous; they‚Äôll likely reassure you and keep things relaxed.

n0n5fq,Anxiety,Why do people do this?,SnapesSocks,"I got made fun of today. I‚Äôm 42 years old and I got made fun of today. I was trying to get windshield wiper fluid on my way home with my very rambunctious and distracting 5 year old. I stood at the wrong register, because no one told me where I was being rung up and my kiddo was talking to me non stop. (For reference, the cash registers are only 2 feet away from each other.) When I saw that the total on the register in front of me was $3, I realized that wasn‚Äôt right and immediately turned to the other register that said $9 and paid that cashier. It was that simple. And I was so upbeat and friendly to them, outgoing even. On my way out the door with my kiddo, I overheard one cashier tell the other that I ‚Äúmust be stupid how could I not have noticed...‚Äù etc. the door closed. 

I‚Äôve got my anxiety mostly under control at this point in my life but it‚Äôs been a long battle. Something like this...guaranteed they‚Äôve already forgotten it, but it‚Äôs going to stick with me and rattle around in my brain, and make it harder for me the next time I need to go out and do something. And I also know that that‚Äôs all on me. 

But it would have taken nothing for her to say nothing or at least to wait until the door closed behind me. The way she did it was so offhand and uncharitable. Why do people do that?",777,100,1619639355,"in my experience working in service jobs, there‚Äôs a tendency to expect customers to act as if they are as familiar with the space as are the employees who work there every day. employees make fun of customers for minor misunderstandings and faux pas that are actually perfectly understandable. even knowing that, it‚Äôs hard not to take it personally, though. i‚Äôm sorry you had that experience.",389,user6733688544,"Honest answer: It's more about her than you.

I'm a lot more chilled out and compassionate now at age 36 than I was between the ages of puberty-23. For me age played into it, but some people never grow past it.

I already had a lot of issues, but my anger issues were the worst back then. When I worked a register it only took one bad customer for my mood to switch from feeling indifference towards customers into annoyance with or even sheer hatred for all of them, no matter how nice or friendly they might be. I hated my job. (Bad customer = screaming, yelling, doing everything in their power to ruin your day kind of bad.)

Though that kind of talk was reserved for the breakroom. I kept a professional customer service smile and attitude anywhere customers could hear, but I also have an explanation for why she didn't wait.

Sometimes it wasn't even about being aggravated or mad. Sometimes it was just a toxic form of bonding with my coworkers. They all complained about or mocked customers, so I did too. That's practically what the breakroom was for. She was apparently in rush to engage in that kind of bonding. I saw it happen more than once during my retail years.

It's terrible behavior, but it really does say more about her than you. She's an angry, bitter person who probably hates her job. You just had the misfortune of encountering her. Everyone gets distracted and makes simple mistakes sometimes. Her poor perspective on life doesn't mean anything bad about you. Please remember that.",122,TerminologyLacking,"I‚Äôm really sorry you had to deal with that‚Äîespecially when you were already juggling a noisy five‚Äëyear‚Äëold and trying to keep things moving.

POST TITLE: Why do people do this?

POST BODY: I got made fun of today. I‚Äôm 42 years old and I got made fun of today. I was trying to get windshield wiper fluid on my way home with my very rambunctious and distracting 5 year old. I stood at the wrong register, because no one told me where I was being rung up and my kiddo was talking to me non stop. (For reference, the cash registers are only 2 feet away from each other.) When I saw that the total on the register in front of me was $3, I realized that wasn‚Äôt right and immediately turned to the other register that said $9 and paid that cashier. It was that simple. And I was so upbeat and friendly to them, outgoing even. On my way out the door with my kiddo, I overheard one cashier tell the other that I ‚Äúmust be stupid how could I not have noticed...‚Äù etc. the door closed. 

I‚Äôve got my anxiety mostly under control at this point in my life but it‚Äôs been a long battle. Something like this...guaranteed they‚Äôve already forgotten it, but it‚Äôs going to stick with me and rattle around in my brain, and make it harder for me the next time I need to go out and do something. And I also know that that‚Äôs all on me. 

But it would have taken nothing for her to say nothing or at least to wait until the door closed behind me. The way she did it was so offhand and uncharitable. Why do people do that?

Going back to the same spot, on your own, is a huge step in reclaiming that space and proving to yourself that you can be okay there.  

If you ever feel the anxiety creeping back, try the ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù grounding trick or a quick box‚Äëbreathing cycle while you wait for your food; it can keep the nervous system from spiraling.

And I‚Äôm utterly speechless. Today was the first time I met this doctor. I have had a nightmarish phase for the past 2 years. I have so many things going on and so much to lose. I told her my entire story and she patiently listened to me, until she broke down. 

Watching her, I couldn‚Äôt hold myself either. My eyes got misty and I tried my hardest to make sure she doesn‚Äôt see that I‚Äôm weeping too. As a 25 year old male, crying with her would have been embarrassing, that‚Äôs what I thought. 

I don‚Äôt really know what to make of it. She is a pretty well known psychiatrist with an MD and decades of experience. She patiently listened to me and prescribed me the meds that would help me battle anxiety and ADHD. She seemed really kind and compassionate, and the fact that she cried listening to my story made me realize how bad my situation really is.

Anyone else?",792,81,1548432404,"I literally don't answer my phone, period, unless I'm expecting a call. If there was an emergency and someone called me, I wouldn't answer until I got a text explaining the situation. Or if I recognise the number I might text them and ask what's up. Phone calls are bad enough, but phone calls out of the blue, I can't handle. So my phone is on silent 24/7. My phone is used much more as an alarm, map, workout tracker, and portable device, than for calls/texts to begin with. 

Texts are much better though. I can take the time to formulate a reply, and also if someone isn't available to answer, you can tell them what you wanted to say in the mean time, allowing them to answer later rather than having to call you back etc. ",78,JesusGreen,"Yup. I can't even respond to my friends nowadays. It has killed my social life and I don't know how to make it better. I just hate the idea of being on the hook for a conversation, call or text. ",3,along7,"I totally get it‚Äîthose little buzzes can feel like a tiny alarm bell for your stress response. It‚Äôs not just you; many people start associating the vibration with ‚Äúsomething I have to deal with right now,‚Äù and the brain ramps up anxiety before you even see who‚Äôs calling.

A few things that have helped me:

1. **Change the cue** ‚Äì switch to a silent, non‚Äëvibrating tone or set a custom vibration pattern that feels neutral. If the buzz isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúred alert,‚Äù it‚Äôs less likely to trigger the same reaction.  
2. **Scheduled check‚Äëins** ‚Äì decide on specific times to look at messages (e.g., every hour). Knowing you‚Äôll handle it later can reduce the instant panic.  
3. **Grounding tricks** ‚Äì when you feel the buzz, take three slow breaths, notice the sensation in your feet, and remind yourself you‚Äôre safe and in control.

If the anxiety feels overwhelming, a quick chat with a therapist can give you personalized tools. You‚Äôre not alone, and you can definitely re‚Äëtrain your brain to feel calmer around those vibrations. Hang in there!","

Lurking in this sub has helped me cope with a lot of my insecurities and has helped me realise that i am not alone. So thank you all for that! 

To all of you, I also want to say that there is a way out of anxiety. You can get better, no matter which road you choose to do it through and it is definitely wort it! I really hope for you all that you will keep on fighting and come through all of your struggles. No matter if you think them small or overwhelming, struggle is a struggle, so keep on fighting that devil! 

Some advise from my therapist (psychiatrist) that might help some if you (it helped me a lot!) is to realise that worrying wont solve anything. Not that you should be able to control when your brain starts to worry, but if it starts, then don‚Äôt give it as much attention (i used to worry about everything and it drained all of energy). A point my therapist also made was that if two persons got in an accident, one who worries about such accident and one who doesn‚Äôt, the one who worries won‚Äôt be any more prepared than the one who don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs an incident, it‚Äôs a part of life. 
Getting to accepting that fact helped me through everything. I don‚Äôt say it will help
everyone, but i hope it will help some of you &lt;3 

Lots of love from me!

Edit: just to clarify about the term ‚Äúcured‚Äù. I lacked a better word, but maybe acceptance is a better substitute? Idk, but what i mean is that my anxiety no longer is an issue that i have to use so much energy on :) I know how to deal with it and don‚Äôt feel it anymore - and if it should come back tomorrow, in a week, a month, a year, a decade, i know how to deal with it ;) And if it comes, it comes.

HIV isn‚Äôt efficiently transmitted that way, and without any known exposure on their side the odds are practically negligible.

Still, it never hurts to get peace of mind. A quick visit to your doctor (or a walk‚Äëin clinic) for an HIV test and a basic STI screen can give you a concrete result and a clear timeline for any follow‚Äëup. Most places can do a rapid HIV test with results in minutes, and it‚Äôs free or low‚Äëcost.

Beyond the test, consider talking to a therapist who specializes in health anxiety/‚ÄãOCD. Cognitive‚Äëbehavioral strategies and exposure work can help break the cycle of worry. Meanwhile, practice grounding techniques (deep breathing, 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 senses) when the anxiety spikes.

POST TITLE: I got drunk for the first time in over 6 years this weekend. My anxiety is now so bad, that I am considering suicide.

POST BODY: I haven't drank in many years. This weekend I got drunk. I don't know why I allowed myself to drink, I guess I am not as strong as I thought, and now my anxiety is out of control. It has been almost two days since I drank, but my anxiety is still so bad that I feel that I would rather die than experience one more day feeling this badly. 

I have attempted suicide twice in the past, the last time being 5 years ago. I really don't want to die, but can no longer live with near constant and debilitating anxiety. 

Has anyone ever experienced these feelings after using alcohol? Thanks for reading.

Edit: I don't think it is right to downvote posts about suicide. Can someone please tell me what I said in my post that was wrong? I am really sorry if I should not post here.

When you feel these energies, which are overwhelming, observe them and let them pass as if you are detached from them and don't judge yourself for feeling this way because we all have (and are) feeling similar emotions  right now!!

n9nzjp,Anxiety,I battled my anxiety and got the Covid vaccine!,iheartrevolution,"I've spent most of the last 14 months inside, and my preexisting anxiety has gotten more intense. I've also had a previous anaphylactic reaction to a food allergy and most of my anxiety attacks have been regarding having a reaction to new foods or foods that are similar to what I know I am allergic to. Because of this, I have been extremely nervous about  getting vaccinated. I knew it was the right thing to do, and the way that the world gets better. I trust science and understand the facts that there's much more risk in long term Covid effects than negative effects from the vaccine.

I put it off much longer than I should have, but today I finally faced the fear and got through it. My experience was so positive. I found a local Buddhist university and knew that was the location I was meant to get it at. Everything went right, from the beginning. The parking attendant allowed us to pull right up and get the shot in our car even though the location recently went from drive through to walk up.

POST BODY: I‚Äôve recently developed pretty bad anxiety, and was diagnosed with GAD from my therapist. I prefer to deal with it naturally (sans-meds) by attending therapy, getting regular exercise, and monitoring my diet, but lately it feels like it‚Äôs not enough. Are there any success stories out there regarding controlling anxiety without meds?


Edit: Wow! I‚Äôm shocked by the level of support everyone provided! Thank you so much! I‚Äôm going to try to get to as many comments as I can throughout the day!

Anxiety can crank up the volume on everything, making even small things feel like a tidal wave. A few things that have helped me (and many others) when the panic spikes:

1. **Grounding** ‚Äì try the 5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1 technique: notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. It pulls your brain out of the ‚Äúrun‚Äù loop.  
2. **Breathing** ‚Äì slow, diaphragmatic breaths (inhale for 4 counts, hold 2, exhale for 6) can calm the nervous system within minutes.  
3. **Movement** ‚Äì a short walk, stretching, or even shaking out your limbs can release built‚Äëup tension.  

If it‚Äôs a frequent pattern, consider reaching out to a therapist or a trusted friend; talking it through can be a huge relief. You don‚Äôt have to ride this wave alone‚Äîtake one small step, and be gentle with yourself. Sending calm vibes your way.","

x5rqor,Anxiety,Why do you think boomers do not understand anxiety?,Bananabread4,"I keep reading posts where people vent about their parents not being understanding with anxiety (and other mental health) symptoms. 

They hear phrases like: it will go away, why are you  anxious, how can you solve this, you are dramatic etc etc

I come across this many years now, from people all over the world. How can this be? 

My parents do this as well. They think anxiety can be solved somehow, like when one has a migraine and they take something for it and it goes away. They look at me confused and perplexed while I explain them some of the symptoms. 

How come boomers are not familiar with this, even in the least?",674,194,1662310461,Because it's what most of them where taught and it was reinforced by their parents and our society as a whole. Mental health struggles are just more recently being understood better and you get generations are just starting to make it a priority. Mental health issues have been stigmatized for a long time and we are just recently pushing for them to be normalized and to normalize the support that people need,547,scarpenter42,"My mom understands anxiety due to me having it and her finally realizing she has am anxious personality. But with her, she doesn't understand the need of a medication for it. I feel shamed because I take Effexor.",2,Rush4Life70494,"I hear you‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting to keep explaining that anxiety isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust a mood‚Äù that you can will away. Most boomers grew up when mental‚Äëhealth language was limited to ‚Äúnerves‚Äù or ‚Äústress,‚Äù and the idea of a brain chemistry imbalance was almost unheard of. That cultural backdrop, plus a tendency to value self‚Äëreliance, often turns well‚Äëmeaning concern into dismissal.

A few things that sometimes help:  
* **Share a short, factual resource** (a 2‚Äëminute video or a reputable article) that frames anxiety as a medical condition, not a character flaw.  
* **Name the impact** (‚ÄúWhen you say ‚Äòjust relax,‚Äô it makes me feel unheard and actually heightens my panic‚Äù). Specific feedback can break the ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt get it‚Äù cycle.  
* **Set boundaries** for conversations that become invalidating‚Äîe.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay talking about this later, but right now I need to focus on work.‚Äù

k2vm53,Anxiety,Finally mustered up the courage and applied to grad school!,wrxcurls,"I graduated from undergrad about 5 years ago and never got a job in my field. I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn‚Äôt understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist. I finally did something that scared me, and even if it doesn't work out, at least now I can say that I tried and I gave it my all.",797,70,1606597355,"Very inspiring!

A few things that helped me (and many others) after a big push like this:

1. **Break the next task into micro‚Äësteps.**‚ÄØInstead of ‚Äúfind a job,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúopen LinkedIn, copy one job title,‚Äù then ‚Äúwrite a one‚Äësentence cover note.‚Äù Tiny wins keep the anxiety from snowballing.  
2. **Keep a ‚Äúsuccess log.‚Äù** Jot down every thing you did despite the fear ‚Äì emailing professors, sending the application, even the panic attacks you survived. When doubt creeps back, you have proof you can follow through.  
3. **Use your therapist as a rehearsal partner.** Role‚Äëplay interview questions or the email you‚Äôll send to a professor; the more you practice the less your body will treat it as a threat.  

Remember, grad school is just one path","

n94dce,Anxiety,I made 2 phone calls this morning!,ToastedTwinkles,"I used to have very severe phone anxiety to the point i would have an anxiety attack and either never make the call, or take 2 hours to calm down enough to do it.

It still makes me anxious and I'm sweating a bit but I'm really proud of myself. For anyone else who also struggles with this, you can do it! Just take small steps. I would suggest starting with easy short phone calls such as calling a family member or asking what a store's hours are. Good luck.

stbidb,Anxiety,Anyone else in the vicious cycle of procrastination/do-nothing &gt; hate yourself &gt; repeat cycle?,medquestion80,"I've suffered from some form of depression for the last 10-20 years. (I'm early 40's now).

I'm really struggling to break out of this cycle:

1. Feel behind where I think I should be in life career/success wise and hate myself for it
2. Attempt to start making some change by studying or job hunting, but immediately shut down and end up doing nothing and sleeping or finding a distraction instead. In the past this shutdown was just more self-hatred and numbness, but now I'd say that when I attempt to make change I start to feel more anxiety about it (maybe a 4/10 surge?) that pushes me away.
3. Repeat for years on end and now it's really bad.

I've tried taking smaller steps, but that hasn't worked well. In general I've had a total feeling of malaise/anhedonia, but over time now I feel more anxiety about this as I'm feeling the time pressure. In particular the time pressure is horrifying to me because I'm still single and want kids, hate my career, and haven't bought a home yet and this market is beyond stupid.

Any particular practices help getting you moving forward?

Any particular meds that got you out of these loops of rumination and inability to take action?",794,70,1644954379,Yeah :/ I think I get overwhelmed and confused and indecisive and then I just move toward some distraction.,62,[deleted],Yeah :/ I think I get overwhelmed and confused and indecisive and then I just move toward some distraction.,62,[deleted],"I hear you ‚Äì it feels like you‚Äôre stuck in a loop that keeps pulling you back the moment you try to move forward, and the pressure of ‚Äútime ticking‚Äù only makes the anxiety louder.‚ÄØYou‚Äôre not alone in that; many people with long‚Äëterm depression experience exactly this mix of self‚Äëcriticism, paralysis, and a sudden spike of anxiety when they try to act.

A couple of things that have helped others break the pattern:

1. **Therapy‚ÄØ+‚ÄØbehavioral activation** ‚Äì Even a short, structured weekly session (CBT or ACT) can give you a concrete ‚Äúhomework‚Äù list that‚Äôs broken into 5‚Äëminute micro‚Äëtasks. Completing a tiny task (e.g., open a job‚Äësearch site for 3‚ÄØmin) tricks your brain into rewarding action, which gradually lowers the anxiety spike.

2. **Medication check‚Äëin** ‚Äì If you haven‚Äôt already, talk to a psychiatrist about an SSRI or an SNRI. Those can lift the baseline mood enough that the ‚Äúenergy to start‚Äù barrier shrinks.","

It‚Äôs like the world is still there, but you can control the volume and the pressure. If you find that comforting, lean into it, but also consider a few gentle ways to stretch the feeling a bit farther.

- **Pick shows or podcasts that feel like conversation** (talk‚Äëshows, sitcoms, or interview podcasts). The back‚Äëand‚Äëforth feels more like a real exchange than a scripted drama.  
- **Create a ‚Äúvirtual coffee break‚Äù**: set a timer for 5‚Äë10‚ÄØminutes, watch a short clip, then pause and write a quick thought about it. It can turn passive listening into a tiny, low‚Äëstakes interaction with yourself.  
- **Try low‚Äëkey online communities** (e.g., Discord servers with voice chats that stay on mute unless you want to speak). You can still hear people without the anxiety of speaking.

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to meet yourself where you are. Those background voices are a legitimate form of connection, and they can be a stepping stone toward feeling a little less isolated when you‚Äôre ready. üå±","

acbd0s,Anxiety,Aced a phone interview and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,Queenbach,"Three years ago you would‚Äôve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I‚Äôd either pass the phone to my family, or I‚Äôd be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I‚Äôd blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn‚Äôt even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They‚Äôd be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could‚Äôve said better, the ways I could‚Äôve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn‚Äôt write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I‚Äôm hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I‚Äôm here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!",829,32,1546556147,Good job on the interview! Here's a upvote to celebrate,25,SomtimesDepressed,"I feel you. I had to call gamefly today to fix my account, it looked like my heart was about to grow legs and hop out. ",13,Shattered_Persona,"Congratulations! üéâ I totally get how terrifying the phone used to feel ‚Äì I used to dread every ring, too. The fact that you turned that fear into a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep practice plan is huge, and landing a second interview shows it‚Äôs paying off.

A few things that helped me (and might help you continue the momentum):

1. **Micro‚Äëexposures** ‚Äì keep doing those short ‚Äúcheck‚Äëin‚Äù calls with friends or even a voicemail‚Äëto‚Äëself. The more your brain sees the phone as ‚Äújust another conversation,‚Äù the less it spikes.

2. **Grounding before you pick up** ‚Äì a quick 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breath or a 10‚Äësecond body‚Äëscan can calm that shake before your voice even starts.

3. **Record & replay** ‚Äì after a call, listen to a short clip of yourself. You‚Äôll notice you sound clearer than you think, and you can spot tiny tweaks without the judgment.

I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could‚Äôve said better, the ways I could‚Äôve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn‚Äôt write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I‚Äôm hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I‚Äôm here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!

eq8lgh,Anxiety,I'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things,waterpanne,"You think I choose to feel this way? ""Just don't worry about it"" wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. Amazing advice, thanks.


I have some really bad fears that I can't get over and I am just at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore",778,83,1579304624,As if anxiety is a choice.,133,[deleted],"It sucks to hear people say that, but hey, it's a good gesture. Not everyone can sit down and explain exactly why your rationale isnt how you should be thinking about things. People most of the time understand that you won't stop worrying about things. As a person with hella anxiety, I tell people to not worry about things. Not cuz I think it'll stop their worrying, but because I know that it really is reassuring

Edit: reworded a sentence",25,method_mayo,"I hear you. It‚Äôs exhausting when everyone‚Äôs ‚Äújust don‚Äôt worry‚Äù feels like a dismissal of something that‚Äôs actually weighing on you every day.‚ÄØYour anxiety isn‚Äôt a choice, and the ‚Äújust relax‚Äù line often just adds guilt for feeling the way you do a good job at normalizing the struggle.

If you haven‚Äôt already, consider a few low‚Äëpressure steps:  

* **Therapy** ‚Äì A therapist trained in CBT or ACT can give you concrete tools (thought‚Äërecording, exposure work, acceptance strategies) that go beyond ‚Äústop worrying.‚Äù  
* **Small, scheduled worries** ‚Äì Set a 10‚Äëminute ‚Äúworry window‚Äù each day; write down what‚Äôs on your mind, then gently close the notebook and shift focus.  
* **Grounding & breath work** ‚Äì Techniques like 4‚Äë7‚Äë8 breathing or the ‚Äú5‚Äë4‚Äë3‚Äë2‚Äë1‚Äù sensory scan can pull you out of the spiral in the moment.  

Most importantly, be kind to yourself. You","
